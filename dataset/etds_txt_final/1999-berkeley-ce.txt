CHAPTER ONE:
OVERVIEW
1.0 BACKGROUND
Today there are nearly 8,000 offshore platforms around the globe involved in the exploration, 
production and storage of oil and natural gas; nearly 4,000 of these are located in the Gulf of 
Mexico. With such a large concentration of structures in an area prone to severe storm 
conditions, it is not surprising that the vast majority of design and assessment efforts 
associated with these platforms focus on survivability when subjected to forces from wind, 
wave and current.
However, the offshore oil industry also possesses a lengthy, if not as well known, history of 
operations in regions where earthquakes, and not severe storms, control the design of 
structures. The first recorded hydrocarbon recovery operations over water took place in 1897 
near the town of Summerland, California. What is believed to be the first offshore well was 
drilled from a wooden pier extending 300 ft from the shoreline. Compared to the frenzy of 
offshore oil development witnessed in the Gulf of Mexico in the 1950’s and 1960’s, 
development of oil resources in major seismic zones continued at a relatively slow but steady 
place. The first steel jacket platforms were installed off California in the late 1950’s in fairly 
shallow waters (50 ft or less). The Uniform Building Code or other conventional engineering 
standards were usually applied to the design of these early platforms, although in some 
instances earthquake design was neglected entirely. Earthquake design provisions in the 
early versions of the offshore industry’s design standard, API RP 2A (American Petroleum

Institute Recommended Practice for Planning, Designing and Constructing Fixed Offshore 
Platforms, first edition 1969), continued to reflect the conventional engineering standards of 
the time.
With the desire to place platforms in deeper waters off California, the oil industry began to 
recognize that design for platform survivability during large earthquakes was a major 
consideration. This posed unprecedented challenges for the offshore engineering community, 
as structural design for most platforms subject to wind, wave and current was typically 
accomplished using static analysis. Hence, in the 1960’s the offshore industry began to 
sponsor the development of computational programs capable of performing nonlinear 
dynamic analysis of large frame structures. In addition, testing programs were undertaken in 
the 1970’s to physically evaluate the post-yield performance of tubular steel frames. Efforts 
were also made to study the cyclic behavior of soils (also of great interest to the nuclear 
power industry), and to extrapolate the cyclic behavior steel pipe piles from field test data 
performed under slow cycling conditions. As a result of these efforts, the industry was able to 
make rapid progress on enhancing the earthquake design guidelines contained within API RP 
2A in the middle 1970’s. The platforms which were placed offshore southern California in 
the 1970’s and 1980’s were able to benefit greatly from this work.
The number of jacket-type platforms in seismically-active regions of the world’s oceans 
remains small today, numbering perhaps 100 structures; the majority of these are offshore 
southern California. With new technology extending the life of old oil fields, these 
platforms, like their brethren in other parts of the world’s oceans, are being called upon for

extended service beyond their original design lives. It is clear that some form of structural 
integrity assessment must be performed for these platforms, taking into account the current 
conditions of the platforms and revised estimates o f the earthquake potential of the 
surrounding region. While there exist today many nonlinear dynamic software packages such 
as CAP/SEASTAR, KARMA and USFOS capable of analyzing large jacket-type platforms in 
the time domain for earthquake ground motions, it must be recognized that these programs 
require a high degree of expertise to operate. To apply these tools as part of a comprehensive 
risk assessment involving a large number o f structures would be prohibitive in terms of time 
and money. What is needed is a staged process of assessment, by which the bulk of the 
structure population can be assessed quickly using cheap, conservative methods, leaving the 
more problematic cases for further rigorous analysis.
1.1 OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE
The fundamental question addressed by this research is whether it is possible to develop a 
rational and simplified analysis method to evaluate the structural integrity of jacket-type 
offshore platforms subjected to severe earthquakes. Therefore, the objective of this research 
is to answer this question by developing and verifying such a method. The following issues 
are thus addressed in this research:
• Platform vibration properties.
• Forces on platform components from earthquake excitation.
• Platform displacements and accelerations at different framing levels.
• Strength and displacement ductility of platform structural components.
3

• Effective increases in static lateral load capacity of platform systems through recognition 
of the nonlinear hysteretic action of the platform structural system.
• Structural reliability of the global platform system.
• Verification of the simplified method with results from detailed nonlinear dynamic 
analyses.
• Development of software which performs the simplified analyses.
A pseudo-static approach based on response spectrum analysis offers an excellent means of 
predicting the forces on platform components, and displacements and accelerations in the 
platform structure (important for equipment assessment) assuming elastic behavior in the 
structural system. This requires some knowledge of the vibration properties of the platform. 
To avoid developing a full-frame model of the platform, however, simple means of 
estimating the vibration mode shapes and periods of the structure for the primary directions 
of response must be found.
If forces from the response spectrum analysis exceed the strength capacities of platform 
components, it does not mean that the platform has collapsed. The platform will have some 
tolerance for displacements beyond those reached at the strength limit state due to the 
displacement ductility (i.e., tolerance for post-yield deformation) of the components of the 
platform. Means must be found to relate this tolerance for displacement, and the associated 
load-displacement behavior of the platform past the strength limit state, to an “effective” 
increase in static load capacity.

To determine the global strength and displacement ductility of the platform system, the 
strength and ductility of platform components (deck bay, jacket bays, foundation) and 
elements (deck and jacket legs, tubular braces and joints, pile piles and soils) must be 
determined. Relationships between local displacement ductility and global displacement 
ductility must be established. To implicitly account for the cyclic content of the earthquake 
ground motion pulses, cyclic limits on element strength and displacement ductility must be 
used.
With the above questions answered, it becomes possible to perform deterministic structural 
integrity assessments of platforms subjected to earthquakes, providing the basics of the 
platform structure and mass are known, and a response spectrum appropriate to the location 
of the platform is available. However, earthquake assessment is a practice with many 
uncertainties. The ground motions occurring at a given location due to an earthquake are 
essentially a random process, leading to great uncertainty in the response spectrum ordinates. 
Variability in platform vibration properties and damping will further influence the loads 
estimated from a response spectrum. Imperfections and inconsistent construction will add 
uncertainty to structural strength and ductility estimates. Furthermore, the process by which 
an “effective” dynamic capacity is determined for a platform also contains substantial 
uncertainties. A probabilistic process must be invoked, so as to obtain answers from the 
assessment process which are weighted based on the confidence with which each variable is 
known.
5

To evaluate the simplified assessment process, comparisons must be made between results 
obtained from application of the process, and results obtained from application of more 
detailed nonlinear dynamic analysis methods. In this fashion, the simplified method can be 
qualitatively (comparing predicted failure modes) and quantitatively (comparing vibration 
properties, loads, and earthquake spectral or scale factors causing failure) checked for 
consistency and conservatism relative to more rigorous analysis.
As a final task, once verified, the simplified procedures should be implemented into a 
program which is capable of performing the necessary calculations.
1.2 INVESTIGATION APPROACH
The investigation approach adopted for this research is diagrammed in Figure 1-1. A review 
of platform vibration properties was conducted by literature search. Using information in a 
variety of published sources together with reports provided by the project sponsors, it was 
established that for typical jacket-type platforms (four to twelve legs, topsides mass greater 
than 30% of total mass including added mass, sited in 400 ft of water or less), the first and 
second horizontal modes in each principal direction dominate horizontal response, while the 
first vertical mode dominates vertical response. A simplified procedure to estimate mode 
shapes and periods was developed; by separating out the primary steel structure shearing and 
bending displacement components and the foundation drift and rotation displacement 
components, flexibility matrices for lateral and vertical displacement could easily be 
constructed for the platform. These matrices could then be used in a proper modal analysis, 
or used in hand calculations to estimate vibration properties.

Together with a response spectrum, these modal properties could be used to estimate 
earthquake forces on the platform. A simple modified Uniform Building Code (1994) 
approach was also studied; while it was found to provide suitable estimates of modal forces,

it lacked the ability to provide information on platform displacements and accelerations. The 
simplified approach was then verified by application to five case study platforms, and 
comparison to 3-D frame analyses. A sensitivity study evaluating the effects of foundation 
flexibility (a variable with high uncertainty in offshore engineering) on earthquake loads was 
also conducted using two of the case study platforms.
A review of nonlinear pseudo-static methods of earthquake analysis was conducted by 
literature search. Given the tendency for most typical platform systems to be first horizontal 
mode dominated, it was decided that the response factor approach would provide the 
necessary bridge between presumed linear but actual nonlinear behavior of yielding platform 
systems. The literature search revealed a lack of data concerning the behavior of strength and 
stiffness degrading structural systems; hence a plan was developed to calculate response 
factors for systems which exhibit this type of behavior. Another literature search was 
conducted, to identify in a phenomenological sense what types of degrading behavior should 
be studied. The search revealed that the primary sources of degradation in platform systems 
subject to cyclic loading are:
• Strength degradation of piles forced to undergo large axial displacements.
• Strength and stiffness degradation of piles forced to undergo large lateral deformations.
• Strength and stiffness degradation of braced frame systems with braces which do not 
buckle locally.
• Strength and stiffness degradation of braced frame systems with braces which do buckle 
locally.
8

• Strength and stiffness degradation o f braced frame systems with joints which fail by 
punching or tearing.
• Strength and stiffness degradation o f braced frame systems which unzip due to weak 
horizontal framing systems or a lack o f redundancy.
Using these types of structural degradation as a guide, the responses of a series of single 
degree-of-ffeedom (SDOF) systems which exhibited these types of hysteretic behaviors to a 
family of earthquake time histories recorded on rock were studied. The data from these 
numerical experiments were used to develop a set of capacity increase (or load reduction) 
factors suitable for modifying the static load capacity of platform systems which exhibit these 
types of degradation. These factors are intended to be selected for use with a given structural 
system based on a match between these systems and certain qualities which the structural 
system in question possesses. A limited study was also conducted to see how sensitive these 
factors were to damping and to time histories recorded on other soil types (alluvium, soft soil 
with a predominant site period). A series of comparisons was then conducted between the 
SDOF system responses and a number of two, three and four degree-of-ffeedom systems 
which possessed elements which would exhibit the types of degradation listed above. 
Providing the response of the structure was dominated by the first horizontal modes in the 
principal directions (modal participation of at least 70% to 80%), it was found that the 
degrading SDOF systems could represent the displacement behavior of the degrading multi 
degree-of-ffeedom (MDOF) systems in a reasonable manner.

Returning to the capacity aspects of assessment, the platform system was first characterized 
as a series system of different components (see Figure 1-2): structural bays and a foundation. 
Each component, in turn, was recognized as consisting of a parallel set of elements: legs, 
braces and joints, and piles. The yield strength of the platform is governed by the yielding of 
the first element in the weakest component. The ultimate strength of the platform is 
governed by the lowest ultimate strength of all the platform components. Beyond the 
displacement associated with the point o f ultimate strength of the platform, the platform can 
tolerate additional displacement up to the point at which the platform system becomes 
unstable.
Using plastic analysis concepts together with virtual work, strength capacities of the different 
components were formulated. Using test data found during a literature search, cyclic 
displacement ductility limits were established for structural elements. These limits, set for 
beam-columns, are intended to capture the amount of repeatable inelastic deformation a 
tubular member can support without suffering local buckling. If an element’s cyclic

displacement ductility limit is exceeded, it is considered incapable of supporting load. Joints 
were considered to have no strength past yield, unless grouted; in that case, they were 
assumed to behave as elastic-plastic elements. Damaged members were assumed to possess 
no displacement ductility. In lieu of developing a static pushover analysis procedure, 
approximate procedures were developed to relate global and local displacements in a yielding 
platform, taking into account the initial load pattern forcing the displacements, structural 
redundancy, stiffness and strength discontinuities, and element changes in stiffness and 
strength. Platform limits on global displacement ductility were established by relating back 
to the local cyclic displacement ductility capacities of gravity load-supporting members. The 
simplified global strength and global displacement ductility analysis procedures were verified 
through application to five case study platforms, and comparison to static pushover analysis 
results.
With the simplified modal properties determination procedure, simplified global strength and 
displacement ductility capacity calculation procedures and the nonlinear response factors 
developed, the deterministic portion of the assessment process was complete. To evaluate 
the process, the approach was applied to the analysis of the five case study platforms, which 
were also subjected to nonlinear dynamic analysis for a limited number of earthquake time 
histories. By comparing the scale factors applied to the time histories (previously scaled to 
the point at which yielding began in the platforms) needed to cause a certain amount of 
damage in the platforms during the time history analyses to the capacity modification factor 
associated with each platform, the accuracy and conservatism of the simplified methods 
could be assessed.
11

A mean-value first-order second moment (MVFOSM) reliability approach was adopted for 
use in performing reliability analysis as part of the simplified assessment approach. Safety 
indices are estimated for each platform component. The platform is idealized as a series 
system; failure of one component (structural bays or foundation) will result in failure of the 
complete system. Based on the results of a literature search, it was suspected that the primary 
source of uncertainty was to be found on the demand side (spectral ordinates); however, the 
uncertainty associated with the demand-capacity interaction (response factors) was also found 
to be significant for high levels of displacement ductility capacity. The simplified reliability 
approach was used to estimate the probability of failure of a small platform for a single 
earthquake source; the probability of failure of this platform was also estimated using a 
Monte Carlo approach, and the results were compared.
The simplified vibration procedure, simplified global strength and displacement ductility 
capacity calculation procedures and the MVFOSM reliability procedures have been 
incorporated into a program called TOPCAT: Template Offshore Platform Capacity 
Assessment Tools. The program consists of a MS Excel v7.0 workbook with 15 modules 
containing calculation algorithms and input/output control features written in MS Visual 
Basic. Information on the program and its use is available in the TOPCAT User Manual 
developed by Stear and Bea (1999).

1.3 OVERVIEW OF ASSESSMENT APPROACH
The assessment approach developed for this research is diagrammed in Figure 1-3. 
Information of the global dimensions and layout o f the platform must be specified, along with 
joint, brace, leg and pile dimensions. A soil profile must defined, with the user supplying soil 
adhesion data. A response spectrum must also be defined.
Modal properties are calculated first. The mass of the platform structure and supported 
equipment is calculated and lumped at the decks and horizontal framing levels of the 
platform. A flexibility matrix associated with four separate modes of lateral response 
(structure shear, structure bending, foundation drift, foundation rotation) is constructed. Only 
the deck legs and diagonal braces are considered for structure shear; only the legs are 
considered for structure bending; only the piles are considered for foundation drift and 
rotation. A flexibility matrix for one mode of vertical response is also constructed; only the 
legs and piles are considered. Using the mass and flexibility matrices, an iterative approach 
is used to solve the standard eigenvalue problem and determine mode shapes and periods.
Using the platform mode shapes and periods, modal responses are determined and combined. 
Shear demands for each bay in the structure are determined for each principal direction and 
left separate (braces parallel to one principal axis will not resist shears parallel to the other); 
shear components for both principal directions at the foundation level are combined. Axial 
forces from overturning are combined with axial forces from vertical response.

Platform component strength capacities are calculated using plastic analysis and virtual work. 
Unbraced deck bays are assumed to reach ultimate strength when all legs have formed double 
hinges; the capacity of the associated portal mechanism is reduced to account for P-A effects. 
Braced bays are assumed to reach capacity when the weakest brace in the bay reaches its 
buckling load. The foundation will reach its lateral capacity when double hinges form in the 
piles; it will reach its overturning capacity when the first pile yields.
The platform global strength capacity is found by comparing the response demands with the 
requisite component capacities. If none of the platform components have their strength 
capacities exceeded, the platform is assumed to remain linear. If performing a deterministic 
assessment, this would be an indication of satisfactory performance. If platform components, 
however, have had their strengths exceeded, it is necessary to evaluate the global 
displacement ductility of the platform, and to determine an appropriate response factor.
The global load capacity of the platform is defined as the base shear the platform is subject to 
when the first component yields. Platform global displacement ductility capacity is 
determined by two approximate methods. With the first method, displacement is assumed to 
concentrate in the first component to yield. In the second method, displacement is assumed 
to reflect the elastic pattern of displacements associated with the lateral load pattern 
calculated from the response spectrum analysis. Using each approximation, the structure is 
allowed to displace until the displacement ductility of one of the gravity load-carrying 
supports is exceeded. Based on the characteristics of the component to yield, i.e. piles or 
structure, type of framing, member sizes, a response factor is selected and used to modify the

global base shear capacity of the platform. This modified base shear is the effective dynamic 
capacity of the platform, and can be compared directly to the elastically-calculated base shear 
found from the response spectrum analysis. If yielding is indicated in more than one 
component, the effective dynamic capacity is determined for each instance of yielding. Thus, 
a range in effective dynamic capacity is determined, depending on the displacement ductility 
tolerance of the elements in the different collapse mechanisms and the associated hysteretic 
behavior of the mechanism.
Taking into account uncertainties and biases, a  MVFOSM reliability analysis is performed. 
Safety indices are determined for each platform component. Reliability of the platform 
system is taken as the lowest calculated reliability from the individual components.

CHAPTER TWO:
BACKGROUND TO EARTHQUAKE ASSESSMENT
2.0 INTRODUCTION
A typical jacket-type platform is shown in Figure 2-1. This platform consists of three major 
components: (1) a steel frame assemblage (referred to as the jacket or template) made up of 
tubular bracing members, (2) steel pipe piles which either pass through the legs of the frame 
assemblage or are attached at the base of the frame, and penetrate into the soil beneath the 
platform, and (3) a deck structure supported by tubular steel legs which are attached to the 
top of the frame. The deck supports drilling, production and/or support equipment. Drilling 
and production platforms will also support well-conductors, which are steel pipes that 
penetrate into the soil beneath the platform and serve as guides and conduits for drilling 
equipment. Conductors typically have strong lateral support at the deck and at points in the 
jacket, but weak vertical support. There might also be additional structural at the mudline in 
the way of mud mats, which are intended to keep the jacket from sinking into the foundation 
soil prior to the placement of the piles. The section supporting the deck will in some cases 
have tubular bracing like those in the jacket; however, many older platforms do not have 
bracing in this portion of the structure due to both constructability concerns and a desire to 
keep this section free of members which would increase hydrodynamic drag on the platform. 
Piles which penetrate through the legs of the platform (main piles) are connected to the jacket 
by welds at the top of the jacket; some platforms also have cement grout in the pile-jacket leg 
annulus. Piles attached at the bottom of the jacket (skirt piles) are either welded or grouted 
into guides which are connected to the jacket structure.

There are approximately one hundred platforms similar to the one shown in Figure 2-1 in
service in regions of significant historical seismicity. The majority of these platforms are
located offshore southern California, with others deployed in locations such as Alaska, Japan,
China, Indonesia, Venezuela and Chile. Figures 2-2 and 2-3 allow for a comparison between

areas of seismic activity and offshore oil infrastructure. Most of these one hundred platforms 
are in shallow to moderate water depths (a few fathoms to 400 ft), although a few are in 
depths close to 1,000 ft. Many of the shallow water platforms were installed in the 1960’s 
and early 1970’s, with the deeper structures being placed in the late 1970’s and early 1980’s.

With the development of new exploration, drilling and recovery technologies, the oil industry 
has been able to increase or maintain the productivity of many fields which were originally 
anticipated to yield useful service lives of perhaps twenty five years. This benefit of 
extending field life has in turn resulted in a dilemma for the offshore oil industry; many of the 
platforms currently in service were designed and installed in the 1960’s and 1970’s, and are 
nearing the end of their intended service periods from a structural integrity standpoint. Many

While nonlinear structural analysis software packages suitable for the performance of
structural integrity assessments are available, to apply this software is both expensive and
requires a great deal of expertise. Application of this software to a large number of structures
is impractical on grounds of cost. Hence, the concept of multi-level screening, that is, the use
of successive levels of analysis of increasing complexity (and cost) to perform platform

assessments, has become very attractive. Substantial effort has been devoted in recent years 
to develop cheap, conservative methods of analysis, by which the bulk of the platform 
population can be assessed quickly, leaving the more problematic cases for further rigorous 
analysis. To date, simplified methods have been successfully developed and verified for the 
assessment of platforms for wind, wave and current forces; however, little work has been 
performed on methods suitable for assessing platforms for severe earthquakes.
This chapter presents background material associated with the assessment of jacket-type 
platforms in seismically-active regions. The concept of multi-level screening as it pertains to 
the offshore industry is summarized, with a short discussion of previous work performed on 
the development of simplified methods. A brief history of the design o f offshore structures in 
earthquake regions is presented. Issues prompting an assessment are stated, and a review of 
earthquake ground motions with emphasis on the offshore environment is made. Issues 
concerning the evaluation of structural integrity of offshore platforms are highlighted, with an 
emphasis on those aspects which must be approximated by a simplified pseudo-static 
analysis. The chapter concludes with a brief discussion of risk policy in the offshore 
community and risk mitigation options.
2.1 MULTI-LEVEL SCREENING AND SIMPLIFIED ANALYSIS METHODS 
In 1996, the American Petroleum Institute issued a supplement Section 17 to API RP 2A- 
WSD twentieth edition containing a standard methodology for the assessment of existing 
platforms. This supplement represents the culmination of nearly eight years of industry, 
government and academic endeavors to develop and evaluate methods for assessing aging
22

platforms. The methodology contained in the supplement is a multi-level approach to the 
problem of screening large fleets of platforms; the basic process is diagrammed in Figure 2-4. 
This process allows platform owners to arrive at assessment decisions based on qualitative 
analysis of such factors as life safety, failure consequence and original design basis prior to 
application of structural analysis. Furthermore, if the platform is unable to pass a design 
level analysis, the use of ultimate strength analysis methods is permitted. This process 
represents a departure from the previous pass-fail approach used by the industry (Miller, et 
al., 1990), in which platforms were assessed by linear-elastic structural analysis, with the 
intent of satisfying the design basis requirements contained within the current edition of API 
RP 2A-WSD.
An important provision contained within Section 17 allows for the use of simplified 
procedures for evaluation of the adequacy of existing platforms, providing they are subject to 
rigorous verification. Simplified methods of structural integrity assessment for platforms has 
been a subject of some interest to the offshore oil industry since 1990; several approaches 
have been developed and verified and are now being applied in practice by platform owners. 
Two such approaches are those developed by Bea and DesRoches (1993) and Bea and 
Mortazavi (1995) suitable for assessing platforms for wind, wave and current loads. These 
two related approaches are simple static demand-capacity analyses. Lateral load capacities 
for the deck bay, jacket bay and foundation (lateral and overturning) of a platform are 
developed using plastic analysis. Loads and capacities are confined to the principal axes of 
the platform, so as to maximize the demand on the jacket bays. Loads from wind, wave and 
current are estimated assuming the structure is lumped in line with the wave crest. A
23

comparison is then made between the lateral load capacity of each of the above components, 
and the imposed lateral load. Mortazavi and Bea (1996) have also incorporated a simplified 
reliability analysis into their approach, to allow for the inclusion of load and capacity 
uncertainties. The platform is considered to be a series system (deck bay, jacket bays, 
foundation), with probability of failure of the entire system governed by the lowest 
component probability of failure in the system.
The approaches developed by Bea and DesRoches (1993) and Bea and Mortazavi (1995) 
have been compared against results from static pushover analyses of several older platforms 
(Bea, et al., 1995; Stear, Bea, 1997A), a modified linear elastic structural analysis method 
(Stear, Bea, 1997B) as well as against results from displacement tests of low-redundancy 
frames (Mortazavi, Bea, 1997). Using base shear at ultimate strength as an index of platform 
capacity, the respective effective biases between the simplified analyses and the three 
comparisons were 1.03, 0.95 and 1.05 for the frame tests. The amount of effort which went 
into performing the simplified analyses was on the order of 1/30 of that required for 
performing and interpreting the static pushover analyses.
A surprising benefit of the simplified analyses was their utility in checking the results of the 
static pushover analyses; in several instances modeling errors were identified in the static 
pushover analyses when initial comparisons were made between the two (Bea, et al., 1995). 
Given the complexity of current nonlinear finite-element software, it appears inevitable that 
even with experienced users, modeling errors, and in some cases program errors, are an 
important consideration.

Recent industry efforts to assess existing platforms for earthquakes have concentrated on the

1990; Kallaby, et al., 1993); Section 17 recommends dynamic analysis for platforms which 
do not pass the initial levels of screening. “Dynamic analysis” as used within Section 17 
does not preclude the use of simplified pseudo-static methods such as static pushover 
analysis, if sufficient justification can be shown that the equivalent static method provides 
results similar to those of time history analysis (Craig, Digre, 1994).
Work on simplified methods for earthquake assessment of offshore platforms has been 
increasing in recent years, as assessments of platforms offshore southern California continue, 
and as new international standards are being developed for the design of platforms subject to 
earthquakes. The draft of the new International Standards Organization (ISO) standard for 
the design of platforms for earthquakes suggests estimating earthquake loads for use with 
static analysis from a ductility-modified elastic response spectrum (Bea, 1996); the response 
spectrum ordinates are reduced by factors which relate the behavior of linear and nonlinear 
SDOF systems. These factors, based on a qualitative review of existing response factor 
approaches, are intended to represent the effective reduction in elastically-calculated load 
which can be gained by a yielding system with a specific type of load-displacement behavior 
(hysteresis) and tolerance for displacement beyond yield (ductility). This approach is 
identical in concept to the response or “/?” factor approach contained in current editions of 
the Uniform Building Code. Selection of the appropriate factor to use is made based on 
qualitative assessment of the proposed platform’s framing system ductility and reserve or 
residual strength. Bea (1996) recommends that as an alternative static pushover analysis be 
used to establish a global load-displacement hysteresis envelope (“backbone curve”), which, 
together with the fundamental period and damping of the platform, can be used to define an
27

equivalent nonlinear SDOF system, and an appropriate factor can be chosen from other 
published sources. Further work is needed, however, develop factors which are associated 
with a wider range of hysteretic behaviors of the type exhibited by platform structural 
systems, and to develop better methods to link these factors back to platform structural 
configuration. This topic is a major subject of this research.
2.2 OFFSHORE DESIGN FOR EARTHQUAKES
Early California platforms dating from the 1950’s and 1960’s were commonly designed using 
procedures from the Uniform  Building Code, which at that time entailed static analysis of the 
structure subject to a lateral load associated with a 0.1 g acceleration. Vertical loads were 
typically not included (Miller, et al., 1990; Kallaby, et al., 1993); in some cases, earthquake 
loads were neglected entirely. When the first edition of API RP 2A-WSD was published in 
1969, the recommendations it had for estimating earthquake forces were taken from then- 
current versions of the Uniform Building Code (API, 1969).
It was not until the mid 1970’s that the offshore engineering community began to develop its 
own set of design guidelines. The seventh and eighth editions of RP 2A-WSD first proposed 
the use of two-level design criteria, by which platforms should be designed for:
• A strength-level earthquake, associated with a 5% to 20% probability of being exceeded
during the design life of the structure (return period of approximately 100 to 200 years); 
the structure should essentially remain elastic for this event.
• A ductility-level earthquake, associated with a 2% to 10% probability of being exceeded
during the design life of the structure (return period of approximately 1,000 to 2,000
28

years); the structure need not remain elastic but should be detailed to safeguard against 
collapse or loss of the platform from failure of equipment.
These editions of RP 2A-WSD included explicit guidelines on how the strength-level and 
ductility-level structural integrity performance of the platform was to be established; while 
strength-level performance was met by satisfaction of allowable stresses in members, 
ductility-level performance was satisfied by use of static pushover analysis following an 
approach described by Kallaby and Millman (1975). Using a load pattern associated with 
modal forces, and recognizing that the current recommended ratio between strength-level 
earthquake intensity and ductility-level earthquake intensity was two, the structure would be 
forced to displace until four times the strain energy absorbed by the strength-level event had 
been absorbed by the structure as measured through global load-deflection without loss of 
stability. The rational for the approach stems from observations made by Veletsos and 
Newmark (1960) on the relationship between the peak responses of linear and elastic-plastic 
systems subjected to earthquakes; in the constant-velocity range of a response spectrum 
(period range 0.1 to 0.5 sec) the effective reduction in elastic load for an elastic-plastic 
system will be given approximately by:
R = ^ 2 /u - l
The rational for the procedure stems from the concept of balancing strain energy between the 
true inelastic system and an equivalent elastic system subject to an elastically-calculated 
response spectrum load; the factor of four represents the energy which must be absorbed if 
the ground motion scale factor were doubled. This concept is diagrammed in Figure 2-5; the 
strain energies E l and E2 must be equal.

Starting with the fifteenth edition of RP 2A-WSD, the explicit ductility requirements were 
removed, and a set of standards of good seismic design practice were substituted. These 
changes were based on a number of research projects which had studied the ductile 
performance of large, redundant platforms subjected to nonlinear time history analysis using 
state-of-the-art software and material modeling (API, 1984). After a review of these projects 
the API committee concluded that platforms would remain stable under earthquake loading in 
excess of strength-level providing:
• The platform being designed was detailed such that redundant, symmetric framing was 
used (Figure 2-6), bracing members were sized to keep slenderness ratios (kL/r) below 80 
and diameter-to-thickness ratios (D/t) below l,300/Fy, joints were detailed to withstand 
the tension capacity of attached members, and cyclic soil properties were used to estimate 
foundation strengths and stiffnesses.

• The scale in intensity between the strength-level and ductility-level earthquake time 
histories was two or less (as measured by earthquake spectrum zero-period acceleration or 
ZPA or earthquake time history peak ground acceleration or PGA) these standards would 
ensure satisfactory performance.
Ductility-level analysis would be required only if these conditions were not met.
The ISO, in an effort to standardize design practices worldwide, recently began to review the 
earthquake provisions contained within RP 2A-WSD, with the intent of adapting them as part 
of a global standard. It was recognized that the provisions within RP 2A-WSD were 
originally developed with a focus on California and Alaska, and therefore can be too 
conservative for many other parts of the world (Craig, 1996). In addition, the ISO has desired 
to incorporate limited consequence factors into the design process, so that platforms 
involving life safety and environmental catastrophe will be better protected than platforms 
with no life safety issues and little consequence of failure (Table 2-1).

While a 200-year event is still recommended for the strength-level earthquake, the ductility- 
level earthquake is based on platform structural safety levels (SSLs) as shown in Table 2-1. 
The structural safety levels represent in an abstract sense the consequences which must be 
considered if the platform should fail in service.
2.3 ASSESSMENT FOCUS
Platform earthquake assessments generally focus on ductility-level performance, primarily for 
economic reasons. Older platforms have, in general, three areas of deficiency (Smith, 1994): 
inadequate design ground motion levels, inadequately arranged or detailed structural framing, 
or reduced capacity resulting from damage, corrosion or fatigue cracking. This latter item 
can also be an issue for new platforms, when damage occurs after installation. These 
deficiencies fall into four categories: design, construction, operation and accidental. These 
are listed below in Table 2-2.
Table 2-2: Possible Deficiencies in Platforms (Smith, 1994)
Design Earthquake forces underestimated, inadequate jacket/deck bay 
framing, inadequate joint design, poor corrosion protection, 
unanticipated scour, gravity loads not accurate
Construction Misalignment legs/braces/joints, undercut welds, insufficient 
penetration welds, tank welds, lamellar tearing, insufficient pile 
penetration, load-out, transportation or launch dam age to primary 
structural elem ents
Operation Corrosion protection not maintained, boat bumpers and landings 
not maintained, trash dumping resulting in strikes on legs and 
braces, field modifications to structure including addition of well 
conductors, production risers and deck equipment above design, 
poorly engineered and implemented repairs to primary structural 
elem ents
Accidental Boat/barge collisions, dropped objects, fires, explosions and

An important step in an assessment is therefore the preparation of a platform condition 
report. After a full service life, it is very likely that the platform which is in place will be 
somewhat different from the platform design drawings.
2.4 EARTHQUAKE GROUND MOTIONS IN THE OFFSHORE ENVIRONMENT 
Up-to-date estimates of the loading environment are established by a review of the current 
design guidelines existing for the region in which the platform is located. In the case of an 
earthquake assessment, this could entail the development of a site-specific set of earthquake 
ground motions (either as a family of time histories, or by developing a response spectrum). 
Prediction of earthquake ground motions at offshore locations is not the focus of this 
research. However, for the purpose of completeness the procedure used to determine the 
ground motions a platform might be subject to at a given location will be summarized. 
Special attention is given to differences between onshore and offshore motions.
Earthquake ground motions are primarily caused by the sudden release of energy resulting 
from the slippage or rupture of rock along fractures in the earth’s crust known as faults. The 
energy released propagates outward from the location of the rupture in the form of waves; 
these waves are felt as ground motion as they propagate through locations near the rupture 
zone.
Of prime importance to the engineer are recordings of the time-dependent variation in ground 
acceleration, velocity and displacement resulting from past earthquakes. With this 
information, it is possible to construct site response spectra and to perform more complex
34

time history analysis. The problem becomes one of selecting which time history traces of 
ground motion to use in order to characterize the likely motions at the site.
Selection of ground motions will depend upon the following:
• The earthquake sources likely to affect the site (i.e., faults).
• The intervening geology between the site and the source faults.
• The geology local to the site.
By matching source, intervening geology and local geology characteristics for the site in
question to those of the recording sites, the engineer can obtain a picture of the types of 
earthquake ground motions which might affect the site due to different source faults. 
However, this process is very empirical, and quite often it is necessary to scale or modify 
existing ground motion records in some way to make up for the lack of a perfect match 
between recording sites and the site under investigation.
Earthquake fault sources will be characterized by type, distance to site, depth below ground 
surface, potential rupture length, slip or displacement rate, and historical activity (Idriss, 
1985). Fault type and potential rupture length have been correlated to likely earthquake 
magnitude, which, together with distance, can be used to scale ground motions via common 
attenuation relationships relating peak ground acceleration and peak ground velocity to 
magnitude and distance. Depth below ground will help characterize the frequency content of 
the motions; shallow earthquakes tend to have very high accelerations near the fault source 
indicating energy in the high frequency range, while for deep sources, much of the high 
frequency range will be damped out. Fault type and distance have also been correlated with
35

shaking duration; reverse-type faults in subduction zones have been responsible for some of 
the longer duration earthquakes recorded (Prince William Sound, Alaska, 1964; Valparaiso, 
Chile, 1985; Michoacan, Mexico, 1985), while the “spreading” in time phenomenon 
associated with the propagation of seismic waves is well-established (Bolt, 1993). Slip rate 
and historical activity are used to estimate the likelihood of an earthquake actually occurring 
on the fault during a given period of time; this is crucial in establishing a probability of 
occurrence for a given earthquake magnitude at a source fault for an exposure time interval.
The effects of intervening geology on ground motion are still a subject of much research. The 
geology of the material through which the waves pass may change the general attenuation 
patterns somewhat; the size of seismic waves may be either increased or decreased as they 
pass from rigid rock to softer materials. Also, waves may be reflected off layers of stiff soil, 
hence changing the general pattern of propagation (Bolt, 1993).
Local soil conditions can have a great impact on the ground motions induced by passing 
seismic waves. Pockets of soft soil surrounded by firm soils and transition areas between 
firm and soft soils can be excited into motion if the passing waves possess frequencies close 
to the frequencies of the soil column at the site; these can result in great amplification of 
ground motion, as seen in western region of the old lake zone of Mexico City in the 1985 
Michoacan earthquake, and to a lesser degree in the Marina District of San Francisco in the 
1989 Loma Prieta earthquake (Bolt, 1993). In many cases, finite-element models of the soil 
column at a known soft-soil site will be developed and subject to base ground motions

recorded at rock or firm sites, in order to evaluate the resulting motions at the surface of the 
soil column which can occur from resonant action.
The number and variety of recorded ground motions existing today is growing, but the 
majority of records are from earthquakes which have occurred in the past twenty years 
(Naeim, Anderson, 1993). While synthetic ground motion time histories are available, from 
the author’s perspective there is still a general preference within the engineering community 
to use historically-recorded motions.
Determining the earthquake sources which can affect an offshore site poses a special 
challenge, as the seismic history of offshore regions is not well known (Smith, 1994). In 
addition, the number of recorded records at offshore sites is very small. Those records which 
have been made exhibit characteristics which are different in some ways from their onshore 
counterparts. As mentioned previously, it is recognized that local pockets of very soft soils 
and transition zones from firm to soft soils can exhibit severe resonance for certain ground 
motions, resulting in amplification of ground excitation as compared to nearby sites on firm 
soil or rock. This has been demonstrated in recent years in both the 1985 Michoacan and the 
1989 Loma Prieta earthquakes (Bolt, 1993). However, while many offshore regions consist 
of layers of soft soils overlaying firm soils, this type of destructive resonance has not yet been 
observed. This could be due to a number of factors. Reece, et al. (1981) suggested that 
ground excitation might rapidly attenuate in extended regions of saturated seafloor soils, and 
that severe resonance might occur only in pockets of soft soil surrounded by firm or near the 
transition areas between firm soil and soft soil.
37

Reece, et al. (1981) noted in a limited study of earthquake ground motions that horizontal 
accelerations for offshore sites were perhaps 10% to 20% lower than for corresponding 
onshore sites for recordings taken at similar distances during the same event. A comparison 
made by Smith (1994) of several onshore and offshore records taken during the same 
earthquake indicated that for equal epicentral distances, there was no significant difference 
between the horizontal accelerations recorded at the two sites, but the vertical accelerations at 
the offshore site were perhaps 50% as strong at those at the onshore site. This difference in 
vertical accelerations between onshore and offshore sites was also documented by Sleefe 
(1990), who noticed differences of up to a full order of magnitude between onshore and 
offshore vertical accelerations. Crouse (1992) has suggested that this difference may be due 
to the presence of deep water above the offshore sites. Vertical components of earthquake 
acceleration are typically composed of propagating P-waves (primary, or compression 
waves), while horizontal accelerations are mainly due to S-waves (secondary or shear waves). 
Water cannot transmit shear, but can transmit compression; therefore this may serve to 
substantially change onshore and offshore vertical accelerations. API (1993), however, 
suggests to conservatively assume that peak vertical acceleration should be taken as 50% of 
the peak horizontal acceleration, which is the current practice used by the onshore structural 
engineering community.
API (1993) includes elastic design response spectra for use in preliminary design (Figure 2- 
7). The spectra were developed for £ = 5 % critical damping; if the system has different 
damping the spectral ordinates can be adjusted by:

Hawaii. The accelerations are associated with a return period of 200 years.
An elastic design response spectrum have also been developed as part of the ISO process to 
develop standard earthquake design guidelines for offshore platforms (Crouse, 1996; Bea, et 
al., 1999). Effort has been made to take advantage of seismic hazard data which has been 
collected over the past twenty years, including geological, tectonic, and seismicity data, 
ground-motion data recorded in different tectonic regimes and on different local geologies, 
and probabilistic seismic hazard studies performed at many sites and regions around the 
world. The ISO spectrum is shown in Figure 2-8. The spectrum is scaled much like the API 
(1993) spectrum for five different zones around the world; the ground accelerations 
associated with the zones are obtained by dividing the zone number by ten. These values of 
ground acceleration correspond to the 200-year return period event associated with each 
region.

This spectrum has also been developed for £ = 5 % critical damping; the same scale factor D

damping is needed. The spectrum is identical to the API (1993) response spectra for periods 
less than 0.125 sec. For periods higher than 0.125 sec, the spectra shape are controlled by 
three parameters: v, a site classification factor for the short period range controlled by local 
soil conditions; lP, a site classification factor for the long period range controlled by local soil 
conditions; and e, a site classification factor for the long period range controlled by 
seismotectonic conditions. These factors are shown in Tables 2-4 and 2-5 for a range of soil 
and seismotectonic conditions.

It is emphasized that both the API and ISO spectra are very approximate, and are intended for 
preliminary design or assessment purposes. Both carry the caution that in moderate to high 
zones of seismicity where high consequence of failure is a concern or where unstable soils 
exist, a site-specific study should be performed.
2.5 EVALUATING STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY
The fundamental goal of a structural integrity assessment is to ensure that the load capacity of 
the platform is not exceeded by the demand placed upon it by environmental or operational 
conditions. In assessing a platform for earthquakes, the analysts desires to demonstrate that 
the platform members will not suffer damage during a strength-level event, and that the 
composite platform system will not collapse during a ductility-level event. To accomplish 
this task requires knowledge of the strength and ductility of platform elements (braces, legs,
42

joints, mats, piles), and a method for translating earthquake excitation into forces and 
displacements on these elements and the platform system as a whole.
A vibrating platform is a complicated dynamic system. There will be significant fluid- 
structure interaction, in the way of added hydrodynamic mass and hydrodynamic radiation 
and drag damping; these interactions will depend on the shape, surface, rigidity, and 
orientation of members as well as on the effective flow conditions of the fluid (Clough, 
1960). There will also be significant soil-structure interaction; soil surrounding the 
foundation piles beneath the platform will be deformed plastically even at low levels of 
dynamic excitation, energy can be radiated away from the structure into the soil medium, soil 
mass can be excited into motion and soil properties will change in relation to the loading rate, 
amount of deformation, and number of loading cycles (Bea, 1980). Load-displacement 
behaviors of piles forced to displace beyond their effective yield point are shown in Figures 
2-9 and 2-10. There might also be a danger of liquefaction of the foundation soils when 
subjected to vibration, which results in a loss of shear strength. Finally, depending on the 
amplitude and duration of motion, members in the steel potion of the structure might yield, 
buckle, or fracture. Load-displacement behavior of tubular beam-columns and axial struts 
are shown in Figures 2-11 and 2-12; global frame behaviors for an X-braced frame and K- 
braced frame are shown in Figures 2-13 and 2-14.
Explicit consideration of these effects requires nonlinear time history analysis. There exist 
today many excellent commercial analysis tools such as CAP/SEASTAR, KARMA and 
USFOS which enable an engineer to perform analyses of this type, but operation of these
43

tools requires considerable time, data storage space, and above all else, good engineering 
judgment. Simply possessing the capability to perform very detailed analyses provides no 
assurance that models which represent the likely behavior of a structure will be developed 
(Bea, 1986). Analysis resources may be better spent on several simpler analyses rather than 
one or two very complex ones. The very complex nature of the problem together with the 
uncertainties in the fluid-structure, soil-structure and structural member behavior emphasizes 
the point that models which consider a range of behavior should be used (API, 1993).
Even with powerful dynamic analysis tools, there is still an element of approximation 
involved in the actual analysis. Material properties for some elements such as soil will be 
known only with great uncertainty. The actual properties of the soil beneath the platform can 
only be obtained by sampling, and it has been well-established from experience that sampling 
techniques cannot currently eliminate much of the uncertainty associated with soil properties, 
and that the techniques themselves may introduce bias and additional uncertainty into the soil 
property estimates (Bea, 1986). While physical theory models of braces have advanced to 
great levels of sophistication, some aspects of cyclic post-buckling behavior can still only be 
accounted for through phenomenological means. The phenomenological relationships 
developed to represent the effects of local buckling and fracture in cycling braces are based 
on limited sets of test data accumulated from sources such as Sherman (1980) and Zayas, et 
al. (1980B).

Application of nonlinear time history techniques requires considerable judgment to determine 
what exactly constitutes “failure” of a platform system or any other structure system (Craig, 
et al., 1993). Measures to determine failure might be:
• Global (deck) displacement
• Local deformation (story drift, joint distortion, brace strain, plastic hinge rotations)
• Energy absorption (accumulated strain energy in elements)
• Residual static capacity (pushover capacity after the extreme seismic event)
•  The point of instability in the numerical solution of the problem.
A combination of several of the above is likely the best approach.
Means exist to approximate many of the special dynamic effects within the framework of 
modal analysis and static analysis. Added mass is calculated based on the projected area of 
members in the direction of expected motion, and added to the mass of the structure as a 
constant (Clough, 1960); fluid damping is usually represented by a small contribution to 
modal damping or neglected entirely (Newmark, Rosenblueth, 1971). The effects of 
nonlinear load-displacement behavior in structural elements on the global response of a 
platform can be approximated by considering the platform to effectively behave as a 
nonlinear SDOF system, and then either:
• Use a SDOF system with hysteretic behavior matching that of the platform to estimate a
normalized peak displacement of the platform system, and relate this normalized 
displacement back to local element displacements by the static pushover analysis 
displacement pattern.
45
Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.
• Use a response factor based on statistical comparisons between elastic SDOF systems and 
nonlinear SDOF systems with load-displacement behaviors similar to that of the global 
platform system to factor down the elastically-calculated loads on the platform, implicitly 
accounting for nonlinear behavior of the platform system.
The two major issues facing application o f pseudo-static approaches to the analysis o f 
offshore platforms are the need for (1) meaningful displacement limits for platform structural 
elements which will implicitly account for the effects o f cyclic loading, and (2) response 
factors which relate the types of nonlinear load-displacement behaviors exhibited by platform 
structural elements, and in turn the global platform system, to elastic platform response. To 
address these issues, the behaviors of platform structural elements and complete platform 
structural systems and previous work on the subject of response factors for platforms should 
be reviewed.
2.5.1 Beam-Columns
Beam-columns make up the legs and piles o f offshore platforms. Typical performance of a 
semi-compact steel tubular cantilever beam-column under lateral load as part of a portal 
mechanism is shown in Figure 2-9. The stiffness of the cantilever softens after the initiation 
of yielding at its base from combined bending and axial stresses. Lateral load can increase 
until either a plastic hinge forms at the base o f the cantilever and/or local buckling of the tube 
wall begins. Following local buckling, effective lateral load capacity will decrease. Inelastic 
cycling of the cantilever will lead to fracture in the locally-buckled region.

Sherman (1979) studied the monotonic and cyclic post-local buckling behavior of tubular 
beam-columns in a project funded by Shell Oil Company. The tests used sets of tubulars 
with D/t ratios of 36 (PA series, L/D ratio of 4.5), 48 (PB series, L/D ratio of 4.4 and PC 
series, L/D ratio 11.1) and 80 (PD series, L/D ratio 4.3), and axial loads P/Py of 
approximately 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8. For the cyclic tests, these members were cycled in a 
cantilever fashion to peak unidirectional displacement ductilities (measured from a reference 
point established by assuming the load-displacement behavior up to the point of maximum 
supportable load was nearly linear, instead of using the true yield point) ranging from 2.0 to
10.2 until failure occurred (defined by tearing and/or less than 10% of maximum measured 
lateral load capacity remaining).

These tests indicated that even for small (0.2 P/Py) values of axial load and low (ji = 2) 
ductility demands, test specimens of series PB, PC and PD exhibited severe strength 
degradation (as much as 70%) after the first two or three complete cycles from local 
buckling; many specimens failed after less than six cycles. The PA series specimens, which 
were not tested for [1 = 2, performed similarly at p. = 4, but for only two of three cycles before 
failure. While these results represent a limited data set, cursory examination indicates tubular 
beam-columns of this type, which encompass most platform legs and pipe piles, should not 
be expected to perform well inelastically when forced to displace laterally as part of a portal 
mechanism in the presence of vertical load.
2.5.2 Braces
Struts, or braces, make up the lateral load-resisting elements of the steel portion of a jacket- 
type platform. Typical performance of steel tubular struts is shown in Figures 2-10 and 2-11. 
Following buckling, the strut becomes unstable, and must shed axial load. The range over 
which this occurs is variable, and depends upon the section properties and effective length. 
Reloading straightens the strut out, placing it in tension. Subsequent cycles of compression 
and tension will exhibit a reduction in effective buckling load, and continued cycling at high 
strain will result in local buckling and fracture.
Sherman (1980) also studied the monotonic and cyclic post-local buckling behavior of
tubular struts. The tests used sets of tubulars with D/t ratios of 36 (SA series, L/D ratio of
20), 48 (SB series, L/D ratio of 20, and SC series, L/D ratio of 50) and 80 (SD series, L/D
ratio of 20), and two-point lateral loads Q/Qy of approximately 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.8. All

members had fixed end conditions, so the effective lengths of all test specimens can be 
considered near 0.5. These members were cycled axially to peak unidirectional displacement 
ductilities ranging from 2.0 to 9.2 until failure occurred (defined by tearing and/or less than 
10% of m axim um  measured axial load capacity remaining). The S A  series stmts tended to 
degrade to 50% of original axial capacity over 10 cycles of (i. = 4, even in the presence of a 
lateral load of Q/Qy = 0.8. The SB series performed similarly, but began to deteriorate and 
fail for lateral loads of Q/Qy = 0.4. The SC  series performed similarly to SB  for a lower level 
of cyclic displacement (ji = 2), while the SD series exhibited very limited post-buckling 
displacement ductility.

Zayas, et al. (1980B) studied the cyclic post-buckling behavior of tubular struts as part of a 
project at U. C. Berkeley focussed on the earthquake performance of tubular offshore 
platforms. The tubular tests used sets of tubulars, both annealded and un-annealed steel, with 
D/t ratios of 33 and 48 and kL/r ratios of 25 (fixed) and 54 (pinned). The members were 
cycled axially, with progressively increasing levels of ductility demand over the course of 15 
cycles. The annealed struts clearly outperformed those which were not heat-treated. The

strut with D/t of 33 and kL/r of 24 developed displacement ductilities of 6 or more without a 
reduction of more than 50% in axial capacity, over the course of 15 cycles. The strut with D/t 
of 48 and kL/r of 54 developed displacement ductilities of less than 3 before suffering a 
reduction of more than 50% in axial capacity from local buckling, over the course of 3 cycles.
2.5.3 Piles
Tubular steel pile piles make up the foundations of jacket-type platforms. For certain types 
of soils, load-displacement behavior at the pile head will exhibit substantial strength 
degradation, and moderate stiffness degradation, when the pile is subject to cyclic inelastic 
loading.

High rates of loading, however, will increase the effective strength capacity of a pile. Axial 
load-displacement behavior as measured at the pile head is shown in Figure 2-12 for a pile in 
soft clay subject to cyclic loading. Figure 2-13 depicts lateral load-displacement behavior as 
measured at the pile head for a pile in stiff clay in a pre- and post-cycled state. Figure 2-14 
depicts lateral load-displacement behavior as measured at the pile head for a pile in dense 
sand in a pre- and post-cycled state.
Piles forced to displace laterally will eventually yield, form plastic hinges, and generally be 
subject to the same behavioral constants as tubular steel beam-columns. A pile displacing 
axially, however, has no physical restriction on displacement; ultimately the axial 
displacement capacity will be governed by stability of the supported platform.
2.5.4 Platform Frames
Of equal importance to the behavior of structural elements is the behavior of platform 
structures. This is an important consideration when a decision must be made regarding the 
selection of an appropriate response factor as part of a simplified pseudo-static analysis. The 
load-displacement behavior of platforms which yield in their foundations or unbraced bays 
will reflect the load-displacement behavior of elements in these components. Platforms 
which yield in the braced portions of their jackets, however, will tend to exhibit more 
complicated behavior; braces will buckle, and load will be redistributed to other portions of 
the jacket. This is a complicated process, but can be determined from static pushover 
analysis.
53
Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.
The load-displacement behavior exhibited by a yielding braced frame will depend upon
several factors:
• The sizes and slenderness of diagonal members. Members with poor post-buckling 
performance will lead to rapid weakening of frame sections after buckling, leading to the 
formation of soft stories in the frame.
• The presence of horizontal members. These members will redistribute the load from 
buckling diagonal members to other braces in the frame. A frame without horizontals or 
with weak horizontals will tend to “unzip” after diagonal members buckle, as load cannot 
be transferred to tension members. The effective load the platform system is able to 
support will drop.
• The orientation of bracing members in a section. If members in a section are oriented 
such that they will all be placed in compression at the same time, it is possible that they 
will all buckle when the first member buckles, as load will be redistributed to 
compression members as opposed to tension members. The result will be the formation 
of a soft story, and a drop in supportable lateral load.
• The presence of K-type bracing. K-type bracing configurations tend to exhibit poor load- 
displacement behavior unless the horizontal member is very strong. If the horizontal 
member is weak, it will likely form a plastic hinge following the buckling of the 
compression brace in the K, due to action of the unbalanced load in the tension brace. 
This will usually result in the formation of a soft story, and a drop in supportable lateral 
load. If the horizontal member is strong, forces in the legs will be higher than in other 
bracing systems.
54
Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.
• X-bracing. X-bracing configurations in a bay will be more effective than single braces. 
However, it should be noted than a brace which is part of an X will tend to buckle 
between the center of the X and the comer; inelastic deformation will be concentrated in 
the buckled section, leading to a more rapid exhaustion of displacement ductility capacity 
than a single brace which spans an equal section. It should be noted that K-braces which 
share common vertices will behave as an X-brace across multiple bays; this is a very 
effective combination.
• The presence of large grouted jacket legs. Grouted jacket legs have substantial stiffness, 
and will contribute to the overall resistance of the jacket bays.
• The durability of tubular joints. Joints which fail by collapse, tearing or punching will 
result in the removal from the load path of attached braces. This can result in drops in 
section strength, followed by the formation of a soft story.
• The presence of any structural sections with radically different stiffness and/or strength. 
Sections of this type will likely become soft stories, by yielding well in advance of other 
sections, or by being subject to large localized displacements.
The good practice recommendations of RP 2A-WSD reflect these facts. A platform which 
has stocky members with low slenderness, strong horizontal frames, symmetric member 
orientations and no weak-beam K-braces will perform globally very much like an elastic- 
plastic system, and will possess some reserve strength; a platform which has any of the 
negative qualities listed will tend to loose strength after the first member buckles, and will 
quickly concentrate damage in the weakened section.

Zayas, et al. (1980A) have studied the cyclic inelastic behavior of two braced frames made of 
tubular members approxim ating  offshore platform structures. Frame parameters are shown in 
Figure 2-15; while their cyclic load-displacement behaviors are shown in Figure 2-16. Both 
platforms have strong joints and strong horizontal framing; however, the diagonal braces in 
Frame I are sized to D/t = 42, while those in Frame II are D/t = 33. Frame II exhibits more 
robust hysteretic behavior than its companion. Frame I was able to develop a global 
displacement ductility of three prior to loss of strength through member failures; Frame II 
was able to develop a global displacement ductility of five prior to a similar loss. Both 
platforms exhibit a gradual loss in effective strength with each cycle; this is associated with 
the drop in buckling capacity of members after the first instance of buckling. The loss 
becomes more pronounced as local buckling occurs within braces, which occurs earlier for 
Frame II. Both frames sustained damage to diagonals in both bays; both eventually suffered 
tearing of the braces in the top bay, followed by the formation of a portal mechanism in this 
bay.
Other researchers have studied the cyclic behavior of K-brace frames; however, to the 
knowledge of the author no cyclic testing has been performed on K-braced frames 
constructed from circular tubular members similar to those commonly used in the 
construction of offshore platforms. Shibata and Wakabayashi (1984) tested a variety of K- 
braced frames with strong beams, weak beams, and stocky and slender braces; results from 
several of these tests are shown in Figures 2-17 and 2-18.

The members in these K-type frames were steel plate sections. Tests A-l and A-3 used 
members with intermediate slenderness, while tests B-2 and B-3 used stockier members. A-l 
and B-2 were strong beam tests, while A-3 and B-3 were weak beam tests. The strong beam 
K-brace frames exhibited hysteresis which was large controlled by the buckling and yielding 
o f braces, while the weak beam tests exhibited sudden losses in strength following member 
buckling, and hysteresis controlled by the formation of a plastic hinge in the beam.
2.5.5 Response Factors for Degrading Systems
The use of response factors to modify the elastically-calculated loads from a response 
spectrum on a nonlinear structural system was in the author’s recollection believed to have 
originally been suggested by Veletsos and Newmark (1960). By assuming the structure to 
behave as a nonlinear SDOF system, and using statistical studies relating the response of a 
nonlinear SDOF system with hysteretic behavior mimicking that of the complete structure to 
an equivalent elastic SDOF system (i.e. with the same period and damping), an estimate as to 
the effective reduction in elastically-calculated load from a response spectrum due to 
acceptable inelastic behavior could be made. This reduction implicitly recognizes that the 
structure has some tolerance for inelastic deformation, and allows for convenient linear 
approximation of the effects of this deformation tolerance on earthquake response.
The response or R factor approach to design of structures is a feature of many building codes 
(Miranda, Bertero, 1994). R factors such as those in the Uniform Building Code are intended 
to be applied in the design of structures which are first lateral mode dominated. While 
structures with five or six lateral DOF can in some cases be largely controlled by first mode
61

response, structures with many DOF and evenly distributed mass will likely have very 
significant higher mode effects, thus making such an approximation unrealistic (Clough, 
Benuska, 1967). Most jacket-type offshore platforms can be idealized as structures with 
perhaps three to six lateral DOF (associated with platforms in water depths of 40 ft to 400 ft), 
and with the presence of a large mass at the top level most lateral response tends to be 
concentrated in the first mode (Smith, 1994). Deep water structures would likely have more 
noticeable higher mode responses.
Numerous studies have been conducted in recent years to determine or revise R factors for 
common structural systems. Much work has been devoted to the study of bilinear elastic- 
plastic or strain hardening systems, with and without stiffness degradation; Miranda (1991) 
and Nassar and Krawinkler (1990) are two recent examples. These studies have confirmed 
that the allowable load reduction due to nonlinear behavior is strongly dependent upon:
• The period of the SDOF system.
• The soil conditions at the site.
A limited number of studies have been performed using nonlinear systems with different 
types of strength degradation; a study performed by Al-Sulaimani and Roesset (1985) is 
perhaps the best example. This study confirmed that the response factor was also sensitive to 
the hysteretic behavior of the system when strength degradation was possible; systems with 
strength degradation should have lower allowable load reduction than systems without.
Clearly, two of the likely mechanisms which will form in an offshore platform will exhibit 
both stiffness and strength degradation. Hence, to apply response factors determined from
62

the analysis of elastic-plastic and bilinear strain-hardening systems is possibly 
unconservative, depending on the severity of the strength degradation in the mechanism. To 
apply the response factor concept to offshore platform assessment and design, response 
factors which simulate the hysteretic behavior of platform systems must be developed.
2.6 RISK ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATION
The emphasis thus far has been on the demand-capacity interaction portion of a structural 
integrity assessment for platforms subjected to earthquakes. It must be recognized that the 
variables which enter into this demand-capacity analysis are not deterministic. Incorporation 
of information regarding the uncertainty in demand, capacity and demand-capacity interaction 
can allow probabilities of failure (judged with respect to the limit states applied to the 
problem) to be determined. These probabilities can be used to judge the relative confidence 
in the results of different failure mode demand-capacity assessments.
However, estimating the probability of failure of the platform system is only part of the 
overall risk management equation. The probability of failure must be combined with the 
potential consequences of failure, in order to make a weighted judgment regarding the 
suitability of continued service for an offshore platform. An attempt has been made with RP 
2A-WSD Section 17 to standardize this process for the offshore oil industry, by introducing 
consequence-based criteria for design and assessment. Section 17 contains provisions to rank 
platforms according to life safety and failure consequence, and allow for less severe design 
and assessment criteria for platforms with no life safety concerns and low failure

consequence. Similar guidelines have been included in the proposed ISO guidelines for 
earthquake design of platforms (Craig, 1996).
If a  platform cannot pass the requisite screening levels, it is unfit for service. In this case, the 
owner has the option of mitigating the risk or decommissioning the platform. There are two 
effective options for mitigating the risk:
• Reducing the probability of failure, by reducing loads and/or increasing capacities.
•  Reducing the consequences of failure.
• Reduce the uncertainties associated with loads and capacities.
Common strategies for reducing loads and increasing capacities are:
• Removal of deck equipment, conductors and piping.
• Removal of marine growth.
• Grouting braces, joints, legs and piles.
• Installing support jackets adjacent to the existing structure, or adding skirt piles.
For platforms in seismic regions, care must be taken when evaluating changes in capacity due 
to the connection between demand and capacity. Changes in mass (decks, marine growth 
reduction) can be used to reduce loads but will also change the vibration properties of the 
platform. Changes in strength can change stiffness, changing the vibration characteristics of 
the platform and hence increase the effective earthquake load attracted to the platform.

Consequences of failure can be grouped into three categories: loss of life, environmental 
pollution, and loss of resources, property and production. The following are measures 
suggested by Billington, et al. (1993) for reducing risk through adjustment of failure 
consequence:
• Increasing life safety by evacuation. This does not work for earthquakes, where there is 
no effective warning time. However, an alternative would be to reduce manned 
operations on the platform, in order to reduce the time during which crew are exposed to 
the possibility of failure.
• Remove oil storage, install safety shutdown valves.
• Move key facilities away, and consider re-drilling at other locations.
For probabilistic risk assessment, effort can be made to collect more data, and to remove 
biases from existing data. This is a challenging task for the problem of earthquake 
assessment. Earthquake ground motions contain much inherent uncertainty which cannot be 
eliminated due to their random nature. Better estimates of component post-yield and post- 
buckling performance must currently be derived from testing, given the limitations of today’s 
theory regarding such phenomenon.

CHAPTER THREE:
PREDICTION OF STRENGTH AND DUCTILITY DEMANDS 
FROM EARTHQUAKES
3.0 INTRODUCTION
The fundamental goal of an earthquake analysis is to estimate the loads, displacements and 
number of number of load or displacement cycles a structure will be subject to when excited 
by ground motion. An engineer can then compare these earthquake demands against the 
capacity of the structure, as controlled by the strength, ductility and robustness of its 
structural components and by the tolerable loads and displacements critical equipment can 
withstand, to ensure the structure is capable of withstanding these demands.
Earthquake analysis of offshore platforms poses special challenges to an engineer. A 
platform differs from the average onshore building by (1) being surrounded by water and (2) 
possessing in many cases a noticeably flexible foundation. Hence, the analysis of a platform 
will entail accounting for fluid-structure interaction and soil-structure interaction in addition 
to accounting for non-linear behavior in the platform structure itself.
The presence of water around the platform has two principal effects:
• The effective inertia of the platform is increased by the added mass effect (Clough, 1960).
• There will be an effective resisting force to motion proportional to the square of the 
velocity of the platform (drag force on the platform as it moves relative to the water, 
Clough, 1960).
66

There is also an additional velocity-proportional force which acts to resist motion due to the 
generation of waves (radiation damping, Clough, 1960); however, for structures consisting of 
small-diameter tubular members this force is small relative to drag and is often neglected 
(Brebbia, Walker, 1979). These hydrodynamic effects exhibit some dependence on:
•  Fluid flow uniformity, expressed by the Keulegan-Carpenter (KC) number:
UT
where U and T  are the velocity amplitude and period of the oscillation and D is the 
diameter of the member moving through the fluid.
• Fluid flow regime (measure of turbulence), expressed by Reynolds number {Re):
n  U DRe = -----
v
where vis the fluid viscosity.
• Member shape and roughness.
• Proximity to sea floor and to free surface.
Obviously, rigorously accounting for the hydrodynamic action can be a challenging task 
analytically.
The foundation poses additional complications. The load-displacement behavior exhibit by 
piles and mats is non-linear, even at small levels of displacement. This is due in part to small 
amounts of plastic deformation in soils adjacent to piles and foundation mats, and also due to 
the fact that soils adjacent to such elements rarely possess uniform properties (Bea, 1986).
67

Many soils exhibit strong loading rate dependence; hence, piles and mats will appear to gain 
strength and stiffness relative to their static values due to the load rate-proportional resistance 
of the soils (Bea, 1986). “Free-fleld” soils, those not adjacent to the platform but adjacent to 
the “near-field” soils, which are adjacent to the platform, can be excited into motion by the 
platform, providing additional inertial resistance at foundation level. Movement of free-fleld 
soils during an earthquake can result in additional stresses being induced in piles (Bea, et al., 
1979). In addition, compression waves transmitted from the near-field soils to the free-field 
soils serve as another source of damping force (Richart, et al., 1970); while this is a 
significant source of damping for structures such as nuclear power containment buildings and 
gravity base platforms, it is often neglected for pile-supported jacket-type platforms as being 
small relative to the energy dissipated through hystereris of foundation soils (Penzien, 1975). 
Pile and mat foundations can also exhibit strength and stiffness reduction when subjected to 
large displacement cycling (Bea, 1986).
The steel structure of a jacket-type platform is made up of tubular steel members. Most 
platforms are essentially braced frames, although some may have unbraced sections 
immediately beneath the deck. Analysis of structures such as these poses little difficulty so 
long as the members do not yield or buckle; however, if the platform is subjected to severe 
motions yielding, and, more importantly buckling will take place, resulting in non-linear 
behavior of these elements and the platform as a whole. This non-linear behavior can be 
exacerbated if the platform does not possess sufficient redundancy or has undesirable framing 
configurations, and the platform will degrade globally in stiffness and strength (Gates, et al.,
68

1977). In addition, the tubular joint connections between members can fracture under 
repeated cycling due to low cycle fatigue, leading to similar global degradation.
The most accurate means of accounting for all of these effects is to construct a MDOF model 
of the platform as shown in Figure 3-1, and perform dynamic (time history) analysis using 
this model. An engineer can track the time-dependent response of all elements within the 
platform, in addition to evaluating the complex fluid-structure and soil-structure interaction. 
With each analyses, the engineer can assess the earthquake demand and earthquake demand- 
platform capacity interaction explicitly, and thus obtain an extremely detailed analytical 
picture of the stresses, strains, and stress or strain cycles each element is subject to. 
However, to build, analyze and especially to process the results of such a model represents a 
great commitment of time and effort, and requires experience with the analysis tools.

As an alternative to dynamic analysis, an engineer might choose instead to first apply a static 
analysis method which approximates the true dynamic response of the platform. Static 
analysis approaches to earthquake analysis have long been used as an alternative to dynamic 
analysis (Chopra, 1995), and in many cases will suffice to quickly show loads and demands 
on structural components, so that weak links and configurations with poor ductility and 
robustness can quickly be identified.
Perhaps the most common approach to estimating forces and displacements for use in a static 
analysis is modal response spectrum analysis (Chopra, 1995). This approach allows an 
engineer to establish the peak response (base shear, overturning moment, etc.) associated 
with each vibration mode of the structure; these peak responses are then combined to obtain 
the total response. The true phase between these responses is unknown, however; 
furthermore the number of load cycles is invisible to the engineer. Also, modal response 
spectrum analysis is strictly valid for linear systems.
However, based on observed trends between the responses of elastic and inelastic systems, 
various approximate methods of using response spectrum results to estimate inelastic 
displacement demands have been proposed. These approaches usually entail either assuming 
the elastic and inelastic displacements throughout the structure will be the same (Veletsos, 
1969; Newmark, Hall, 1982) or by assuming that inelastic response will be concentrated in 
the first lateral modes, and hence the structure may be analyzed using static pushover analysis 
together with forces from a response spectrum analysis modified by a factor to account for 
demand-capacity interaction (Saiidi, Sozen, 1979; Lin, Mahin, 1983; Miranda, 1991;
70

Lawson, et al., 1994). While the first type of approach is usually good at capturing higher 
mode contributions to displacements, it suffers from not being able to account for the damage 
concentration which is typically found in yielding structures (Luyties, et al., 1976; Haviland, 
et al., 1976). Likewise, the second type of approach has achieve excellent results at 
predicting the response of structures with moderate numbers of degrees of freedom (Miranda, 
1991), but is (1) sensitive to the load pattern used to perform the pushover analysis, and (2) 
unable to represent higher mode effects. Furthermore, both approaches suffer when the 
number of DOF is large as in a  very tall building (Clough, Benuska, 1967). However, these 
static methods can be applied quickly and cheaply over a wide range of parameters to develop 
a good response picture.
This chapter outlines a simple pseudo-static approach by which earthquake-induced forces 
and displacements on platforms can be estimated. Using the basic global mass and load- 
displacement properties of a platform, the vibration properties of the platform are estimated 
from modal analysis. These properties are used together with response spectrum analysis to 
estimate forces on the platform. A simple design code-based approach for estimating 
earthquake forces is also evaluated, and a brief parameter study focussed on the effects of 
foundation flexibility and added mass on vibration properties, and hence earthquake forces, is 
also conducted. For estimating inelastic displacements, it is assumed damage will 
concentrate in the first mode, and hence static pushover analysis together with response 
spectrum forces and a demand-capacity modification factor can be used to estimate the 
inelastic response of the platform.

The simplified modal method is used to determine the vibration properties of a simple 
platform; these results are compared to those obtained from response spectrum analysis of a 
traditional frill frame 2-D model. In addition, earthquake demands estimated using both the 
simplified modal response spectrum method and time history analysis of the full frame 2-D 
model are estimated for comparison purposes for a series of three earthquakes. The 
simplified inelastic method is used to estimate the inelastic response of the simple platform; 
this result is compared to results from non-linear time history analyses of the frill frame 2-D 
model for a series of three earthquakes.
3.1 SIMPLE LINEAR RESPONSE OF PLATFORMS
The process by which earthquake demands on a platform are estimated begins with modal 
analysis. By considering the primary bending, shear and foundation force-displacement 
mechanisms in the platform, simple estimates of platform lateral and vertical vibration 
properties are made. These properties are developed on both principal horizontal axes and 
the vertical axis; it is assumed there is no significant torsion. The vibration properties are 
then used in a response spectrum analysis to estimate earthquake loads the platform will be 
subject to assuming elastic behavior.
3.1.1 Horizontal Response
The horizontal response of a platform may be thought of as consisting of three components, 
as shown in Figure 3-2. There is a bending component, from the cantilever deflection of the 
platform due to the axial loads on the piles from overturning; a shear component, from the 
shear deformations of each braced jacket bay and the foundation immediately beneath the
72

jacket; and a rotation component, due to the rotation of the jacket at the mudline due to 
tension and compression in the piles.
Shearing RotationBending
Figure 3-2: Horizontal Response Components 
3.1.2 Steel Structure Load-Displacement Relationships
Using very simple structural relationships, it is possible to establish the load-deflection 
properties of each individual response component without much effort. Deflections due to 
bending may be found from:
where I  refers to the moment of inertia of the platform tower structure based on the platform 
pile cross sections, and L  is the height at which load is applied.
Shear deflections may be found by considering the deformation of the individual shear force- 
displacement mechanisms at each level in the platform. For a braced jacket bay, the shear 
stiffness can be estimated as:

where:
ki — axial stiffness of each individual brace, EA/L 
Qt = angle between each brace and the horizontal 
The flexibility of tubular joint connections is not included, and the stiffness contribution of 
jacket-legs can be ignored in most cases. However, some platforms possess large diameter 
legs, with a grouted pile-jacket leg annulus; this will result in substantial stiffness 
contribution from the legs, depending on the size of the braces.
For bays which do not have braces (the deck bay on many platforms do not) the shear 
deformation will be controlled by the bending of the platform legs. In this case, the shear 
stiffness may be estimated from:
"in
kb*,-=lLki
i=l
where:
ki = effective horizontal stiffness of each individual leg, assumed 12EI/L 
The end conditions at the top and bottom of each leg could contribute to reducing this 
stiffness, if there is much rotational flexibility. Unbraced leg sections in the jacket will likely 
have stiffnesses closer to 6EI/L?. Some platforms will have very large leg sections relative to 
the size of the diagonal braces; when the leg-pile annulus is grouted on these structures, the 
effective bay stiffness associated with the legs will be large. In these cases, the bay stiffness 
associated with the legs should be calculated as above and added to the bay stiffness 
associated with the braces.
74

The effective increase in bay stiffnesses due to battered legs is not included in the simplified 
vibration properties formulation.
3.1.3 Foundation Load-Displacement Relationships
For most jacket-type platforms, the shear stiffness at the foundation level is usually based 
only on the lateral stiffnesses of both the piles and any well conductors. However, the 
effective stiffness due to contact between mud mats and mudline braces and the seabed can 
be significant. Therefore, a bounding approach should used to evaluate the effect of 
foundation stiffness. For lower-bound purposes, the stiffness is based upon the stiffnesses of 
only the piles and conductors. For the upper-bound, the stiffness includes the effects of mud 
mats and mudline braces.
As the lateral load-displacement behavior exhibited by piles even at low levels of 
displacement is non-linear (Reese, et al., 1975), it is necessary to approximate an equivalent 
linear stiffness. The lateral stiffness contribution of a pile or conductor will also depend not 
only on the soil properties, but also upon the fixity of the connections between the pile or 
conductor and the platform structure. For the simplified analysis process, the following 
relationship is used to estimate the lateral stiffness of piles and conductors:
3 EI„k =  L.

hinge
where:
Ip = moment of inertia of the piles
dhinge = estimated depth of hinge formation in pile when it forms a mechanism
75

This relationship assumes the pile first forms one hinge, and is able to drift before forming 
the second; it is similar to an approximate one commonly used in preliminary design of pile- 
supported platforms (Dawson, 1982). In the approximate formula, a stiffness coefficient of 
12 instead of three is used, and the presumed depth of plastic hinge formation is varied 
between five and ten pile diameters.
Deflections from foundation rotation are calculated considering the platform to be a rigid 
structure mounted on a rotational spring. This spring stiffness is given by (assuming no mat 
or mudline brace contributions):
npile
kg = ^  kpjU_z Lj 
1=1
where Li is the distance to the pile from the axis of rotation. Pile axial stiffness kpue.z can be 
approximated based on the mechanism by which load is transferred from the pile to the 
foundation soil (Bea, 1980). The vertical stiffness is derived by considering the basic 
stiffness EA/L of the pile column and then modifying this stiffness for the mechanism by 
which vertical loads are transferred to the surrounding soil. Various transfer mechanisms are 
shown below in Figure 3-3.

Sliding and bearing stiffness due to the contact between mud mats, mudline braces and the 
sea floor can be estimated based on the contact area. Bearing and sliding stiffnesses are 
assumed to be controlled by the bearing strength of the supporting soil. The values of soil 
stiffness per unit area shown in Table 3-1 are used for this purpose. The unit sliding stiffness 
is estimated as 50 % of the unit bearing stiffness (Barkan, 1962).

3.1.4 Mass
Masses are lumped at each horizontal framing level and at the deck. These masses include 
the mass of any hydrodynamic added mass or contained mass, marine growth, mounted 
equipment, and conductors. For cylindrical members, the approximate hydrodynamic added 
mass per unit length is defined by (Clough, 1960):
G ladded  — S i n  $
where:
K  = flexibility factor for members; ranges from 0.6 for pinned-end members to 1.0 for
fixed-end members 
pw = density of the surrounding fluid
r = radius of the member
9 = the angle between the cylindrical length axis and the direction of translation

To account for proximity to the free surface, the added mass is further scaled according to 
(Goyal, Chopra, 1989):
madded, z) = madded when z >0.1  H o  
niaddedz) = madded{z / 0.1 H 0 )  when z <0.1 H 0  
where:
z = depth below the surface at mass point 
H 0  = water depth
Soil mass consisting of the soil contained within the piles to a depth of dhinsJ2  is included in 
the mass lumped at the mudline.
3.1.5 Modal Analysis
Considering the platform to be a system of lumped masses (one at each horizontal framing 
level, the decks, and the mudline), the flexibility matrix for this simple system can easily be 
constructed by sum m ing  the component responses to unit loads at each level. The increase in 
flexibility due to P - A effects is presumed to be small and hence is not included. The 
vibration properties of the system can then be found through solution of the standard 
eigenvalue problem o f the form:
fm 0 = 7T &

where:

co = natural frequency 
This form has the advantage of converging to the largest values of l/<sr with each iteration, 
which correspond to the largest periods. In this fashion, the first mode will be found first, 
then the second, and so on. Solution of this problem is a popular subject in engineering; 
readers desiring further information should consult Timoshenko, et al. (1974) and Parlett 
(1980). The iteration process used in the solution of the standard eigenvalue problem is 
summarized below for the sake of completeness.
1. Start with an arbitrary trial vector, <j>n, and solve fm0n = y .
2. Obtain an estimate of the associated eigenvalue, An, by taking the ratio between 
components of $n and y having the same index; hence A„ = y,- / <t>ni ■
3. Normalize y by y,- to get y . Check to see if all y{ = (j)ni; if this condition is met, <j>n is a 
valid eigenvector and An the correct associated eigenvalue. If not, set <j)n = y and return 
to step 1.
In order to obtain eigenvectors and eigenvalues associated with higher modes, it is necessary 
to ensure that successive eigenvectors are orthogonal to one another (the orthogonality 
condition, 0,m0y. = 0 , ensures that the work done by ith mode inertia forces going through j th
mode displacements is zero). This may be accomplished by enforcing the orthogonality 
condition when determining successive eigenvectors:
1. With the eigenvector <px determined, and with a trial vector (f>2 estimated, applying the 
orthogonality condition =0 gives (assuming a diagonal mass matrix):
2. Solving for (this is an arbitrary choice) gives:

3. Calculating <̂x using the above expression prior to using 02 as a trial vector ensures 
orthogonality between 0, and <px. This may be accomplished using the following matrix 
multiplication:

with each iteration of (p2, it may be used to reformulate fm according to fm5I = fmT5[, 
and then operate directly on the reformulated matrix.
Higher modes may be determined by successive application of sweeping matrices. For 
example, a sweeping matrix T52 for removing the dominance of 02 may be constructed, and 
then used together with T51 to allow the third mode ^  to become dominant. This matrix 
Tjj would be constructed by using the fact that = 0 and 07m 03 = 0 . This gives the

3.1.6 Modal Damping Ratios
Damping mechanisms in a platform will include structural damping, hydrodynamic radiation 
and viscous damping, foundation radiation damping and foundation hysteretic behavior 
represented by equivalent viscous damping. The effect of these different energy-dissipating 
mechanisms is generalized into equivalent viscous damping, which is then expressed as 
modal damping ratios (percentage of critical damping).
Newmark and Rosenblueth (1971) recommend a damping ratio of 2% to 3% for welded steel 
structures subjected to moderate excitation. As hydrodynamic radiation damping is small for 
tubular steel structures, it is neglected. Hydrodynamic drag damping is taken as 0.5% 
(Clough, 1960). Previous studies (Penzien, 1975) have shown that the majority of effective 
modal damping for platforms will come from foundation hysteretic mechanisms (primarily 
from yielding of top soil under the platform mudline elements, and small amounts of yielding 
around the piles); radiation damping for pile foundations is small. For hysteretic foundation 
mechanisms, as the level of excitation increases, the effective damping will also increase. 
Based on the study of a platform’s response to earthquake excitation, Mason, et al. (1985) 
estimated modal damping ratios on the order of 5% of greater for low levels of excitation. 
These results are in good agreement with those determined from forced vibration tests 
documented by Ruhl (1976). Bea (1986) suggests a damping ratio of 10% or higher to 
represent the hysteretic action in the foundation for strong levels of excitation. However, the 
relationship between effective foundation damping from hysteresis and earthquake excitation 
level is difficult to predict without iteration. Therefore, the lower value of damping (5%) 
should be used first; if formation of a foundation collapse mechanism is indicated, the higher
82
Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.
value (10%) should then be used to represent the energy dissipated prior to the formation of a 
complete collapse mechanism.
Veletsos and Meek (1974) suggest the following apportionment of damping between 
structure and foundation for the fundamental mode, to represent the relative energy 
dissipation of each mechanism:
  K . ^structure
foundation / ~  \ 3
Cr/ * 0
where 7/ is the period of the platform assuming a fixed base, and Tx is the period including 
foundation flexibility. As foundation damping tends to be predominant in the first mode 
(Veletsos, 1977), it is neglected for the higher modes. This appears to be in agreement with 
results obtained by Ruhl (1976) and Mason, et al. (1989), who observed measured damping 
ratios in the field decreased for higher modes.
3.1.7 Vertical. Torsional Response
Platform vertical response may be determined in a similar fashion as for horizontal response. 
In this case, only the axial stiffnesses of the jacket legs and piles are used to construct the 
flexibility matrix; the solution procedure to find vertical modes will be the same as for 
horizontal modes.
For platforms possessing significant mass and/or stiffness eccentricities, torsion response 
may also be developed in a simple fashion. Rotational stiffnesses between framing levels can 
be developed based on the layout of the diagonal braces (or piles, for the foundation level),
83

while mass moments of inertia can be derived from the spatial distribution of the mass as 
each level. For the purpose of the simplified assessment process, torsion is not explicitly 
considered.
3.1.8 Modal Response Spectrum Analysis
Together with an appropriate response spectrum, modal demands such as bay shear Vin, bay 
drift A,-„, overturning moment Mbn and foundation vertical force Fv* may be estimated as

which are used today in structural engineering practice. One of the most popular in 
engineering practice is the square-root-sum-of-the-squares (SRSS) rule, developed by 
Rosenblueth (1951). This rule provides excellent response estimates for structures which 
have well-separated modal periods, i.e. where the ratio between successive periods is on the 
order of 1.5 for systems with 5% damping. To account for closely-spaced modal periods, the 
complete-quadratic-combination (CQC) rule is sometimes used; a correlation coefficient is 
estimated which accounts for the near in-phase response of closely-spaced modes (Chopra, 
1995). A very conservative rule is the absolute-sum (ABS) rule; this rule assumes all 
responses are in-phase. ABS is very conservative, and is seldom used. Another rule which 
has been used is the so-called NRL-SRSS, proposed by engineers at the Naval Research 
Laboratory. This rule assumes the first two modes are always in phase, and hence are 
combined using ABS; the combined first and second mode response is then combined using 
SRSS with the remaining modes. As most offshore platforms examined as part of this study 
have well-separated modes; the SRSS rule is used to combine the modal responses.
An important issue when using a design response spectrum is the scaling and combination of 
directional responses. Early versions of API RP 2A-WSD recommended using a 1.0/0.66/0.5 
ratio for spectral ordinate scaling between principal horizontal, perpendicular horizontal and 
vertical components, and the SRSS rale to combine responses; the nineteenth and later 
editions recommends using a 1.0/1.0/0.5 ratio. This can have a significant impact on 
performance estimates of the foundation and unbraced deck portals, which are more sensitive 
to off-axis loads than the structural bays.

3.2 SIMPLE LINEAR RESPONSE OF PLATFORMS: EXAMPLE
In this section, the simple linear response analysis procedure is used to determine earthquake 
loads on a small offshore platform. Results from the simple analysis are compared to results 
from response spectrum analysis and time history analysis of a full frame 2-D model.
3.2.1 Description of Platform
Platform A is a hypothetical design for a symmetric 4-leg production platform (see Figure 3- 
4). The structure is designed for 100 ft water depth. The deck is at +50 ft MWL and supports 
a load of 5,000 kips.
The main diagonals in the first jacket bay are 24 inch-diameter (w.t. 0.5 inch), while those in 
the second bay are 30 inch-diameter (w.t. 0.625 inch); the diagonals in the deck bay are 36 
inch-diameter (w.t. 0.75 inch). The legs are 78 inch-diameter (w.t. 0.875 to 1.125 inches); 
they are grouted, and possess heavy joint cans. The piles are 72 inch-diameter (w.t. 1 to 1.5

inches), and are designed for 150 ft penetration in medium to stiff clay. The shear strength of 
the clay is 2.5 kips/ft2 at the surface, and increases by 0.01 kip/ft2 per ft o f depth. The pile 
ends are founded on a very stiff soil layer (rock) which has a shear strength of 184 kips/ft2. 
All steel is A36.
3.2.2 3-D Model Description
A full frame 2-D model was developed for DRAIN2DX (Prakash, et. al., 1993). A constant 
amount of added mass was added to the mass of submerged members. For the model, joints 
were assumed to be rigid, and the deck was assumed to act as a rigid diaphragm. Braces in 
the model were represented by struts as opposed to beam-column elements. All structural 
steel elements in the platform were given stiffness-proportional viscous dampers, which were 
tuned to given a first mode damping ratio of 1% of critical.
In lieu of rigorously modeling the pile-soil interaction as part of the 2-D model, a model of a 
single pile was developed in accordance with API (1993) recommendations, and then used to 
derive pile head load-displacement relationships. Stiffness-proportional viscous dampers 
were then assigned to each element, which were tuned to increase the first mode damping 
ratio to 5% critical. Approximate elastic stiffnesses for these pile-head elements were used in 
the simplified analysis to provide consistency; these stiffnesses are shown in Table 3-2.

3.2.3 Vibration Analysis
The major vibration characteristics of the structure estimated using the two approaches are 
shown below in Figures 3-5 and 3-6. The simple method provides excellent estimates of the 
first two horizontal mode periods as compared with the 2-D frame analysis, but subsequent 
period estimates begin to deviate. The vertical mode period found from the simple method is 
also in good agreement with the period estimated in the 2-D frame analysis.

3.2.4 Earthquake Analysis
Both the simple and 2-D frame modal analyses utilized the API Soil B response spectrum 
(API, 1993) to derive earthquake loads once vibration properties were established. Loads 
were assumed to act simultaneously on the platform vertical and horizontal principal axes; 
the square-root sum-of-the-squares (SRSS) rule was used to combine the individual modal 
and directional responses. The load case used in both analyses consisted of the load on one 
horizontal axis found using the API spectrum for a ZPA of 0.25g combined with load on the 
vertical axis found using 0.125g. In addition to the response spectrum analyses; the 2-D 
frame model was analyzed using time history analyses for three earthquake ground motion 
records: Imperial Valley 1940 (El Centro Pump Plant S00E), Kem County 1952 (Taft 
Lincoln School Tunnel S69E) and Puget Sound 1949 (Highway 1 Test Lab Olympia N04W), 
all scaled to a PGA of 0.25g. All of these records were taken from the US National

Horizontal shears acting at each level along with peak pile loads are shown in Figure 3-7 and 
Table 3-3 for both modal analyses and the maximum results from the three time history 
analyses. Loads calculated from the two response spectrum analyses are, not surprisingly, in 
excellent agreement, given the agreement between the estimated platform vibration properties 
and the fact that most of the platform response is in the first few modes. The peak loads from 
the time history analyses are either enveloped or very close to the peak loads estimated from 
the simple method. The peak loads from all three methods differ by at most 5%.

3.2.5 A Design Code Approach to Earthquake Forces
As an alternative to rigorously evaluating the vibration properties of a platform using modal 
analysis and then applying the response spectrum approach, there exist several semi- 
empirical earthquake-demand estimating approaches such as the one contained in Chapter 16 
of the Uniform Building Code (UBC, 1994). These approaches are based upon the study of 
general trends of structural response to earthquakes, and are intended to allow for the 
development of forces with which a structural design can be started.
The UBC approach for horizontal forces assumes the structure in question has no great 
stiffness discontinuities, and that higher mode effects will decrease rapidly in significance. A 
total approximate base shear is estimated, and then distributed over the height of the structure 
in proportion with the mass at each level. In addition, a concentrated force is applied at the 
top to ensure that forces from higher modes will not be neglected in the upper portions of the 
structure.
To evaluate the utility of this approach in estimating earthquake demands for offshore 
structures, the basic force estimating procedure has been adapted for use with the API 
response spectrum. Base shear (immediately above the foundation) is estimated from: 
v  = sa t w

where:
SAn=  pseudo-acceleration from response spectrum for fundamental period 
W = total mass of the structure, not including foundation
The UBC recommends the following formula to estimate fundamental horizontal periods for 
braced frame structures:
h = height of structure above ground line (ft)
This period assumes no foundation flexibility, and hence will be too rigid for most offshore 
platforms. However, if estimates of foundation stiffnesses can be made, the fundamental 
period may be modified according to a period-lengthening procedure suggested by Veletsos 
andBoaz (1979):
T\ = fixed-base fundamental period
T0 = natural period of foundation mass
k\ — effective horizontal stiffness of fixed-base fundamental
Kx = horizontal stiffness of foundation
Kg = rotational stiffness of foundation
h\* = effective mass center above base, not including foundation mass
Tx =  0 .0 2 ( h ) 075
where:

The effective horizontal stiffness may be approximated by:
. 4;r2 (o.9Af, )
where:
M\ = inertial mass of platform (it is assumed the first lateral mode has 90% mass 
participation)
The natural period of the foundation mass may be estimated from:
where:
WQ -  weight of foundation mass included in model
g = acceleration due to gravity
The forces distributed at the various levels in the structure are then determined in accordance 
with:

i=l
where:
Ft = 0.07 VT/

Ft is applied at the top of the structure, in addition to Fx at the top level. To obtain an 
estimate of the shear imposed on the foundation, the maximum base shear V found above is 
combined with an approximate value of the inertia force of the foundation mass (Veletsos, 
Boaz, 1979):
A0 = pseudo-acceleration of the foundation mass calculated from the response spectrum
the example platform. Earthquake shears determined from 2-D response spectrum analysis 
(the SRSS rule was used to combine modes) are shown together with shears estimated by the 
modified UBC approach in Figure 3-8. The same pile and conductor stiffnesses used in the 
previous section were used to develop foundation translation and rotation stiffnesses.
The shears found using the UBC approach agree quite well with those found through 
application of 3-D RSA, being within 6% of the RSA values. The fundamental period 
estimate is quite good, 1.44 sec compared to 1.47 sec from 2-D modal analysis.

3.2.6 Effect of Foundation Flexibility and Added Mass on Earthquake Loads 
As the foundation is a significant source of platform flexibility, it is important that the 
associated stiffness properties of the foundation be well represented. Typically, stiffnesses 
for piles and conductors are developed by modeling the pile as a segmented beam supported 
by springs, and then developing pile-head load-deflection behavior from these models. In 
lieu of using the above procedure, a number of approximate approaches are available to 
estimate pile-head stiffnesses. Perhaps the most common approaches to estimating lateral 
and axial pile-head stiffnesses are those described in Section 3.1.3. There are, however, 
several other methods of approximation.
95

One alternative for pile-head horizontal stiffness is that used by Penzien (1975) in a series of 
studies of offshore platforms subjected to earthquakes:
( l - o 2 )
kr =  18 J2Gr --
( 2 - v ) ~
where:
G = shear modulus of the foundation soil 
v — Poisson’s ratio for the foundation soil 
r — pile radius
This horizontal stiffness kx is derived using elastic half-space theory and assuming the pile is 
deeply imbedded. Unless the foundation is extremely soft, the horizontal loads will be 
transferred quite rapidly to the surrounding soil with depth. Hence, the horizontal stiffness of 
each pile may be derived by considering the pile-head to be a rigid circular footing supported 
on an elastic medium. It is assumed to connection between the pile and jacket is rigid and 
allows for no pile-head rotation.
Another approach to estimating pile head stiffnesses is that suggested by Dobrey, et al. 
(1980). These approximations are based on previous work by Novak (1974) and Blaney, et 
al. (1976). Assuming foundation strength to rely upon soil elastic modulus and assuming as a 
basis a beam on an uniform elastic foundation, pile-head stiffnesses take the form:
kz = 0.8
EPA f  N0-5
k = 2 V
f  A°'7S
96

where:
Ep = Elastic modulus of pile material
Es = Elastic modulus of soil material
/  = Moment of inertia of pile steel cross-section
Assuming there is no applied moment at the pile head, the effective horizontal stiffness may
be represented by:
k zk ______z*____
x effective t  , ,
K e  +  #  s t r u c t u r e
This effective stiffness will vary depending on the amount of rotational stiffness supplied by 
the structure attached to the pile head, kgStructure. These formulas are intended for intermediate 
values of E/Ep, and r/L ratios in the range of 10 to 50.
A comparison has been made between the various approximate pile-head stiffness and those 
derived during the course of the example platform analysis described earlier. Pile-head 
stiffnesses from the different approximations along with those used in the examples are 
shown below in Tables 3-4 and 3-5:

There is much variation between the approximate methods and the springs derived from the 
finite-element analysis. However, it must be remembered that these estimates may be 
obtained with much less effort than constructing and analyzing a segmented pile model. 
Furthermore, given the fact that soil properties may possess significant biases due to 
sampling and testing methods, there will be an element of variation to the springs derived 
from detailed analyses; this must be recognized by the analyst. The best of action when 
making use of these approximations is to select sets which will provide upper and lower 
bounds on the stiffnesses.
The stiffness contributions of landing mud mats and mudline braces were often ignored in the 
design of early platforms. The contact between the foundation soil and these elements can, 
however, provide great resistance if the supporting soil is strong enough. To study the effect 
of foundation flexibility on the horizontal response of a platform, the axial and horizontal 
pile-head stiffnesses used with the example platform were varied with respect to the values 
calculated from the detailed analysis (see Tables 3-4 and 3-5). The variation in fundamental 
horizontal period for the platform is shown in Figure 3-9. The period is seen to change from

the response spectrum being used.

The variation in fundamental lateral period with added mass was also studied for the example 
platform. The added mass coefficient for tubular braces was varied from 1.0 to 0.0; it was 
not varied for legs, as they are considered not to be flexible in the sense defined by Clough 
(1960). Figure 3-10 shows the variation in fundamental period with the range of added mass 
coefficients considered. The variation is seen to be small; the tendency for brace added mass 
to be of lower important for structures less than 400 ft was also noted by Ruhl (1976) in a 
study of platforms in more moderate depths. Structures in deeper depths (1000 ft) will-have 
more pronounced sensitivity to brace added mass.

3.3 SIMPLE NON-LINEAR RESPONSE OF PLATFORMS
If the loads determined by the simplified response spectrum analysis exceed the yield 
capacities of platform structural components, the platform is assumed to suffer inelastic 
damage. The location and amount of damage is estimated by assuming the platform behaves 
as a non-linear SDOF system (response is assumed dominated by the first mode). The 
damage is assumed to concentrate in the collapse mechanism which begins to form under 
application of first mode forces to the platform.
Two approximate approaches can be taken to determine the effective inelastic demand on the
platform: (1) effective dynamic load or (2) peak displacement demand. These approaches are
diagrammed in Figure 3-11. Both approaches begin by application of static pushover
analysis to determine the lateral load at which the platform yields, and the limiting lateral

global displacement the platform can be forced to prior to sustaining unacceptable damage. 
For the first approach, the displacement limit and the cyclic hysteresis behavior the platform 
will exhibit globally as well as the fundamental period of the platform will enable selection 
of a load reduction factor R. This factor represents the effective reduction in elastically- 
calculated load which is allowed by nonlinear behavior. The effective dynamic load on the 
platform is then expressed by the elastic force estimated from response spectrum analysis 
reduced by the load reduction factor. The capacity of the platform is then assessed for this 
reduced load:

shear from first mode forces which results in yielding in the platform determined from the 
static pushover analysis. It must be noted that this base shear is not the true base shear from 
the earthquake; it is used as a convenient reference to quantify the total lateral load needed to 
induced yielding.
For the second approach, the yield force, the associated hysteretic behavior and the 
fundamental period enable the selection of a displacement modification factor, FA. The factor 
represents the ratio between equivalent linear and nonlinear SDOF system displacements. 
The effective global displacement demand is thus the elastically-calculated deck 
displacement increased or decreased by the displacement modification factor. The capacity 
of the platform is assessed for this modified displacement as:

where AeiasliC is the elastically-calculated deck or global displacement, and A:oiiapse is the 
maximum tolerable global displacement of the platform. The two approaches are similar, but 
not exactly equivalent; load reduction factors are generally developed to restrain a system to a 
maximum fixed displacement ductility, while displacement modification factors simply relate 
mean elastic and inelastic displacements. Yield force is random and displacement ductility is 
fixed for load reduction factor determination, while yield force is fixed and displacement 
ductility is random for determining displacement modification factors.

R factors have been used for many years in the evaluation of design forces for onshore 
structures. The basic definition is given by Miranda and Bertero (1994):
This factor represents the maximum effective reduction in strength which may be taken to 
ensure a ductility of fidesign is not exceeded as a non-linear SDOF system responds to 
earthquake excitation. In a similar sense, it represents the maximum value of the overload 
ratio (elastic response spectrum forces to yield force) which may be tolerated by an SDOF 
system without exceeding the specified ductility of the system.
Fa factors are expressed by:
Miranda (1991), while not specifically referring to this ratio as a factor, suggested use of this 
ratio in checking the displacements of inelastic systems from an elastic response spectrum for 
clearance and stability purposes.
A major goal of this study is the determination of R and FA factors which account for the 
interaction between the hysteretic behavior exhibited by platform systems, overload ratio, and 
associated ductility demand. This topic is the subject of Chapter Five.
It must be emphasized that an approximate analysis of the type shown in Figure 3-11 will be
sensitive to the load pattern used to estimate the formation of a collapse mechanism in the

platform. Miranda (1991) suggests the use of two load patterns when performing the static 
pushover analysis used to correlate global ductility with local ductility capacity: one based on 
a triangular load pattern, and one based on a uniform load pattern.
3.4 SIMPLE NON-LINEAR RESPONSE OF PLATFORMS: EXAMPLE 
hi this section, the simple non-linear response procedure is used to estimate the global 
ductility demand on the same offshore platform considered in Section 3.2 when subjected to 
very severe earthquakes. The results from the simplified analyses are compared to results 
from 2-D time history analysis. As the focus of the analysis is on lateral response, vertical 
excitation is ignored.
3.4.1 2-D Frame Model
The 2-D DRAIN2DX frame model used in Section 3.2 was utilized again for the time history 
analyses. Stmt behavior was assumed to be elastic-plastic, thus the platform was not of a 
type which would suffer strength loss at large displacements or suffer from unzipping of the 
braced frame. Stmt compression strengths were taken as approximately 80% of the fully- 
plastic strength in tension. The goal of this analysis is not to predict the actual capacity of the 
platform, but to demonstrate application of the simplified procedure used to estimate 
demands.
3.4.2 Static Pushover Analysis
A static pushover analysis was performed to establish the global load-displacement behavior 
exhibited by the platform. Using a load pattern based on first mode forces, the platform was

forced to displace until a gross global ductility of 2.25 was reached, as shown in Figure 3-12. 
This ductility was established by using a deck yield displacement of 17 inches, which is the 
onset of severe non-linear behavior. If the point of initial yield was used (13 inches), the 
ductility demand on the platform is 2.94.

The load-displacement behavior exhibited by the platform is this mode is roughly bilinear,
with strain-hardening ratio of approximately 0.001. The yield strength (base shear) of the
platform is 2100 kips. This corresponds to a spectral acceleration of 0.7 lg. This would
correspond to the API (1993) Soil B response spectrum scaled to a PGA of 0.86g. The
relationship between global and local displacement established by the static pushover
analysis is shown below in Figure 3-13 for several levels of deck displacement. In addition,

which yield; in this case, yielding was confined to the diagonal braces in the first and second 
jacket bays, hence the value displayed is the axial displacement ductility o f the most severely 
loaded brace in each bay. If no yielding took place in a section, the associated ductility 
demand was specified as zero. The shape of the collapse mechanism indicated by the 
analysis is shown in Figure 3-14.

A s s u m i n g  ductility is to be limited to 2.25, using data from Miranda (1991) a reduction factor 
R of approximately 2.25 is selected. Therefore, so long as the elastically-calculated base 
shear remains below 2100 kips x  2.25 = 4725 kips, the global ductility demand on the 
platform should not exceed 2.25. This corresponds to a spectral acceleration of 1.59g, which 
is very unlikely in this period range. To achieve this acceleration, the API (1993) response 
spectrum would need to be scaled to a PGA of 1.92g.
Figure 3-14: Shape of Assumed Collapse Mechanism for Example Platform
Similarly, again using data from Miranda (1991) a displacement modification factor FA of 
approximately 0.95 is determined. Hence, so long as the elastically-calculated deck 
displacement of the platform does not exceed 36 inches, the displacement ductility should not 
exceed 2.25. This corresponds to a slightly higher spectral acceleration of 1.69g, with a 
corresponding API (1993) spectrum PGA of 2.05g.

3.4.3 Time History Analyses
To evaluate the accuracy of the ductility demand prediction process, the platform was 
analyzed for the three time histories used in Section 3.2. The time histories were all scaled to 
provide a spectral acceleration o f 1.59g at a period of 1.45 sec with 5% critical damping. The 
scale factors which had to be applied to the time histories are shown in Table 3-7, along with 
their unsealed PGA. These scale factors correspond to very unrealistic conditions; however, 
the goal of this exercise to demonstrate the simplified assessment process, and not perform an 
actual assessment. For reference purposes, the peak deck displacements from each of the time 
history analyses are shown in Table 3-8. The peak ductility demands are shown in Table 3-9.

Using the scale factors in Table 3-7, the analyses indicate that the platform gross global 
displacement ductility will not exceed 2.25 for the time histories considered. Judging from 
the values in Table 3-8, it is likely that if the time histories were scaled to the spectral 
acceleration value corresponding to application of the FA factor, the actual deck displacement 
would have been slightly higher than 2.25, but still very close. It is important to recognize 
that these response factors are random variables, and there will be substantial variability 
when they are applied to jagged spectra.
Equally important, however, is the similarity between the local ductility demands estimated 
in Section 3.4.2 and those shown here. The statically-estimated ductility demands are very 
close to those estimated from time history analyses in the areas of most severe damage 
concentration (the first and second jacket bays), deviating in proportion to the differences in 
the estimated deck displacements between the two analyses. For the Kem County Taft 
record, the difference in estimated global ductility demand is at most 6%, while local 
demands in the area of damage concentration are less close (approximately 25% difference). 
The Imperial Valley El Centro record and Puget Sound Olympia record are less in agreement, 
with differences of 23% and 40% respectively in gross global displacement ductility, and 
differences as high as 50% and 72% in local ductility; however, this difference can be traced 
in part to the deck displacement used in the static analysis and the deck displacements 
estimated by time history analyses. As a structure yields, it may shift off the peak areas of the 
spectrum, while an elastic system is trapped at the peak. This could likely be improved if  a 
simple non-linear SDOF was used to estimate the target deck displacement for the pushover 
analyses, as proposed by Miranda (1991). Response factors are statistically averaged over

many results and are intended for use with smooth design spectra; hence they will not capture 
effects such as period shifting on a jagged spectrum.
Overall, the SDOF approximation to response for this platform provides a good 
approximation to the non-linear behavior estimated through application of time history 
analyses; the time history ductility demands are estimated very closely or enveloped by the 
results of the static analysis. The static analysis is also able to capture the most likely 
collapse mechanism to form, as well (first and second jacket bays). However, these results 
should be viewed with some caution. This platform has roughly four horizontal DOF (one at 
the deck and each horizontal framing level), and the majority of mass (86%) participates in 
the first mode. The amount of inelastic behavior observed in the time history analyses is 
small, with global ductility demands close to unity. Furthermore, by use of stiffness- 
proportional damping, the response o f higher modes will be highly damped as compared to 
the first mode. However, while this can possibly have a significant effect on response prior 
to yielding, damping effects on a yielding structure are expected to be of secondary 
importance. Application of the simple non-linear analysis process, with the goal of assessing 
its accuracy and limitations, is explored further in Chapter Six.
3.5 SUMMARY
Simple procedures for estimating the linear and non-linear earthquake demands on offshore 
platforms have been presented. Linear demands on platforms are estimated first by 
approximating the vibration properties of the platform through a simple modal analysis, and 
then performing response spectrum analysis. Non-linear demands are determined by

assuming the platform behaves as a non-linear SDOF system, and that the pattern of damage 
concentration can be established by static pushover analysis.
An example simple linear analysis has been performed on a small platform. The simple 
modal procedure is found to accurately predict the principal vibration properties of the 
platform when compared to modal analysis using a 2-D M l frame model. Forces estimated 
using response spectrum analysis together with the simple modal results compare well with 
the results of response spectrum analysis and three time history analyses using the full frame 
2-D model of the platform. In addition, a design code approach to earthquake force 
calculation is evaluated; this approach, based on procedures of the UBC (1994) combined 
with period-lengthening approximations for foundation flexibility, is found to compare 
favorably with results from the simplified analysis and the 2-D frame model. Parameter 
studies are conducted to evaluate the effects of foundation flexibility and brace added mass; 
for the platform studied foundation flexibility was found to be an important consideration for 
vibration properties, while brace added mass was of lesser importance.
An example simple non-linear analysis has also been performed on the same platform. The 
simple non-linear analysis approach is able to predict the satisfactory behavior of the 
platform; in addition, the pattern of damage concentration developed by assuming the 
platform behaves as a SDOF system compares well with the damage estimated from time 
history analysis.
Additional case studies which utilize these simple methods are documented in Chapter Six.

CHAPTER FOUR:
EVALUATING PLATFORM STRENGTH AND DUCTILITY CAPACITIES
4.0 INTRODUCTION
The structure of a typical jacket-type offshore platform consists of two types of critical 
components (see Figure 4-1): bays in the structure (both deck leg and jacket sections) and the 
foundation.
A bay in the structure consists of a series of parallel elements (either diagonal braces or 
unbraced leg sections) which act primarily to resist horizontal loads. The foundation also 
consists of a series of parallel elements: the piles (both main and skirt), conductors and 
mudline structure. The foundation elements act to resist both horizontal and overturning 
loads.
It is convenient for assessment purposes to define a “global” capacity for structures with
respect to environmental loads. The global capacity represents the maximum supportable

load, acceptable displacement or energy absorption (as related to the demand measure) the 
structure can tolerate before undesirable behavior results, such as yielding, equipment failure 
or total collapse. For storm loads, the maximum supportable lateral load (i.e. base shear) is 
commonly used as a measure of global capacity. For a given pattern of lateral forces 
associated with an extreme storm wind, wave and current, the capacity of the platform is 
reached when the loads on one of the platform structural components (bays or foundation) 
exceed the load capacity of that component, i.e. a collapse mechanism is initiated. The 
occurrence of first member failure in a component is commonly taken to represent formation 
of a collapse mechanism for storm conditions, due to the sustained nature of the load and the 
low reserve strength typically exhibited by these structures. The storm load capacity of the 
platform is thus dependent upon both the strengths of its components (which are in turn 
dependent upon the strengths of the elements which make up the components) and the pattern 
of forces which results in component failure. The dependence of storm load capacity on the 
pattern of applied forces cannot be neglected; simply scaling up a fixed load pattern as 
opposed to changing the load pattern to represent increasing wave heights will concentrate 
load low in the structure, which can lead to misidentification of the correct collapse 
mechanism which will form. Cyclic loading is generally ignored for storm capacity 
determination, unless the engineer wishes to make use of capacity beyond first member 
failure (Hellan, et al., 1993).
Determining a global platform capacity for resistance against earthquake ground motions
poses a greater challenge to an engineer than determining storm load capacity. The response
of a platform is dependent upon the strength and stiffness of its components (both pre- and
113

post-yield), and the amplitude and sequence of ground motion “pulses.” Damage and failure 
in a platform subject to earthquakes can involve the following:
• The combined action of many modal responses
• Repeated cycling leading to fracture
• Changes in platform strength and stiffness which result in more severe demands
To explicitly evaluate the capacity of the platform to withstand a severe ground motion while 
accounting for these dynamic concerns requires time history analysis. In this case, the 
capacity of the platform will be expressed in terms of ground motion parameters 
representative of the earthquake severity, as opposed to more traditional measures such as 
base shear.
However, it is possible to implicitly account for these dynamic concerns while using
equivalent static capacity measures if the system under evaluation is a relatively simple one.
If the initiation of failure in the platform is due to response quantities dominated by the first
lateral mode, the platform can be idealized as a nonlinear SDOF system, with yield strength
equal to the first lateral mode base shear which results in first member failure in the platform,
and a displacement ductility capacity equal to the global displacement ductility the platform
can develop (using deck displacement as a measure) under the action of first lateral mode
forces. The hysteretic behavior of the equivalent SDOF will be identical to the hysteretic
behavior exhibited by the platform subject to first lateral mode forces. The yield strength of
the SDOF is thus the equivalent earthquake load capacity of the platform, and the
displacement ductility the SDOF can develop is the earthquake displacement ductility
capacity of the platform. The use of this SDOF approximation has been discussed previously

in Chapter Three; the reader is referred to that chapter for additional references on the topic. 
It is important to recognize that this approximation is strongly dependent upon the load 
pattern used to estimate the global load capacity and the formation of a collapse mechanism 
which controls the platform displacement ductility.
The global load capacity and global displacement ductility can be adjusted to account for the 
dynamic concerns. It is possible to bias the load capacity based on a ratio of the portion of 
first mode response which initiates failure in a component to the total response which 
initiates failure. To safeguard against local buckling and fracture, cyclic displacement 
ductility limits for elements can be used (derived from test data and/or theory) when deriving 
the global ductility capacity of the platform. Changes in demand from the elastic state to the 
inelastic state can be accounted for by analyzing the equivalent non-linear SDOF using time 
history analysis, or by using a response factor R or FA which relates the response of linear and 
non-linear SDOF systems to modify results from an elastic response spectrum.
This chapter is documents procedures to determine the global load and displacement ductility 
capacities of offshore platforms. These procedures, while approximate, are intended to 
satisfy the following:
• Allow for identification of weak links in a platform structural system
• Evaluate the effective global strength of a platform, as expressed by base shear
• Evaluate the effective global displacement ductility of a platform, as expressed by deck 
displacement

Procedures to characterize the strengths and displacement ductilities of structural elements 
such as legs, braces, piles and mudline members are developed first. Building on the element 
strength capacities, expressions for the strength of the critical structural components are then 
formulated. From the interaction of these component capacities and an applied load pattern, 
the global strength of the platform can be determined. By assuming damage concentrates in 
platform components which yield, the displacement ductility of the platform as controlled by 
the displacement ductilities of the platform elements can be approximated.
These capacity determination procedures are applied to the evaluation of four structures: two 
tubular X-braced frames studied by Zayas, et al. (1980A), and two Gulf of Mexico platforms 
studied by Stear and Bea (1997A). Using information on the elements and geometry of the 
structures and the applied load pattern, the global strength of the structures, global cyclic 
displacement ductility capacity, and cyclic hysteretic envelope are estimated.
4.1 STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS
The main structural components in jacket-type platforms, i.e. the deck and jacket bays and
the foundation, consist of parallel structural elements. Deck and jacket bays are made up of
tubular braces and tubular legs or columns; these elements provide lateral resistance by axial
loading of the braces and bending of the legs. The foundation consists of piles, conductors
and mudline structure such as mats and horizontal braces; these elements provide lateral
resistance by bending of the legs and conductors and contact between the mudline structure
and top soil layer, and provide overturning resistance by axial loading of the piles and bearing

of the mudline structure on the top soil layer. In the following subsections, strength and 
ductility capacities for each of these different elements are formulated using a combination of 
simple plastic analysis and empirical results from structural testing. These element capacities 
are used in Section 4.2 to develop estimates for component capacities, which are then related 
to the platform global capacities.
4.1.1 Deck and Jacket Legs
A platform deck or jacket leg is a beam-column as shown in Figure 4-2. Assuming hinges 
form at the top and bottom of the leg, the maximum lateral load P  the leg can support is:

The maximum tolerable hinge rotation for the cross-section will be controlled by either local 
buckling or fracture of the extreme fibers. For typical offshore tubular members with D/t 
greater than 25 (semi-compact), rotation will typically be limited by local buckling (Marshall, 
1982). Local buckling in bending of tubular sections is sensitive to the following parameters:
•  D/t  ratio
• Axial load in the member
• Number and sequence of load cycles
• Imperfections in the member
To remain within the confines of a simplified analysis, it is desirable to use a performance 
limit on hinge rotations which will provide protection against local buckling for a large 
number of load cycles, so that information on applied load cycles need not be obtained when 
performing an assessment. As documented in Chapter Two, Sherman (1979) demonstrated 
that tubular beam-columns subjected to both axial load and bending would typically not 
exhibit sustainable ductility in excess of two under cyclic conditions. Sections which did not 
meet the compact section criteria suffered degradation prior to reaching this limit. Hence, 
recognizing the importance of protecting vertical supports, and recognizing their limited 
ductility based on test results, the following limits will be used for assessment purposes:
•  For non-compact sections ( D / f > Ar ):
^ = 1 - 0
•  For semi-compact sections (Ar > D l t >  A ):

With the cross-section behavior established, it is then possible to relate the yield and plastic 
behavior of the cross-section to the P ,A behavior of the member. The approximate yield 
displacement Ay of the beam will be:

and thus the approximate displacement limit of the two-hinge mechanism will be:

As these limits are based on My*, the effective reduction in displacement capacity due to 
axial load is implicitly accounted for.
4.1.2 Tubular Braces
Tubular braces in offshore platforms are often treated as simple stmt elements which only 
resist axial load. The axial strength of a tubular brace can be considered as the lesser of the 
axial strength of the brace and the strength of the joints by which it is connected to other 
structural members, as shown in Figure 4-4:

Simple brace axial strength estimates can be derived from plastic analyses and beam theory.
Tubular braces are assumed to be capable of developing full plastic strength in tension. The 
axial compression capacities of tubular braces can be calculated assuming a three-hinge 
failure mode at collapse (Figure 4-5), as described by Bea and Mortazavi (1995). Based on 
this three-hinge failure mode, the exact solution for the ultimate bending moment in a beam- 
column at collapse is given by:

The distributed local load on the brace results from local response of the brace to earthquake 
excitation. The local acceleration, and hence the local force, can be determined by treating 
each brace as equipment mounted on the platform, and applying one of several common 
modal analysis techniques to estimate the appropriate local response. This subject has been a 
topic of research for many years, and much literature exists on the subject. An excellent 
summary of approaches used to estimate mounted equipment response in structures is 
presented by Bowen and Bea (1995).
The approach selected for estimating the local accelerations for the purposes of this study is 
one proposed by Biggs and Roesset (1970). It was originally developed to predict the 
response of mounted equipment in nuclear power plants. The procedure is organized into 
five steps:
1. Obtain the acceleration at the DOF x  corresponding to the point of equipment support for 
each structure vibration mode i:
ilxi =  TA iSA,
2. Obtain the spectral accelerations for the equipment modes j:
u ^ S A ,
3. If the ratio of equipment mode period to structure mode period, Tej- /  Tsi, is less than 1.25, 
modify the structure’s acceleration uxi at the DOF of attachment by the amplification 
ratio Aej- /  Asi which relates the interaction between the equipment and structure, and 
assign to
124

4. Otherwise, modify the equipment mode’s spectral acceleration by A ej  /  A s i , and assign to
5. Perform the above tasks for each mode of the structure. When done, combine the 
resulting accelerations according to the SRSS rule to get the equipment modal 
acceleration:
Repeat the above tasks for each equipment mode. This will provide spectral accelerations for 
all equipment modes, after which forces can be determined using modal analysis procedures.
There are two limiting cases of equipment response that are important to understand. The 
first is the case in which the equipment is very stiff compared with the supporting structure. 
The equipment must move in the same manner as its support. The motion and the maximum 
acceleration of the equipment mass, A e, must be the same as that of the supporting point on 
the structure, A s. Thus A e = A s.
i over all u
i overall all structure modes
125

The second limiting case is that of very flexible equipment, where the period of the 
equipment, Te, is much greater than that of the supporting structure, Ts. The internal 
distortion of the structure is relatively unimportant and the equipment will behave as though 
it is supported directly on the ground. In this case, the maximum acceleration of the 
equipment is equal to the maximum acceleration of the ground.
Between these two limiting cases, there is interaction between the equipment and the 
structure. The structure behaves as a frequency filter, developing harmonic components with 
frequencies equal to the modal frequencies of the structure. If the equipment has a natural 
frequency close to one of these harmonic components, the motion can be amplified. Near the 
point of resonance (Te ~ Ts), the maximum acceleration of the equipment can be several times 
that of the supporting structure. The amplification (Ae / As) will be proportional to the 
number of cycles of motion, N  (for low damping Ael As ~ N7t). Given a sufficient number of 
cycles (e.g. N>  3), the amplification is limited by damping (Ae /  As ~ 0.5£).
Based on the results of time history analyses of jacket-type platform structures with deck- 
mounted substructures, Bowen and Bea (1995) developed an equipment acceleration 
magnification ratio relationship for use in determining accelerations on deck-mounted 
equipment (Figure 4-6). This relationship will be used to calculate the amplification ratios 
necessary for determining brace local accelerations. The relationship is based on a structure 
damping ratio of 5% and an equipment damping ratio of 2%. The acceleration magnification 
ratio shown in Figure 5-1 represents a mean result; at a given period ratio (ratio of equipment

the vibration mode. For the fundamental lateral mode, A. ranges from TV for a simply- 
supported beam to 22.373 for a fixed-fixed beam. The resulting acceleration is used to 
calculate the effective local lateral load induced on the brace; the local load w is simply 
(yvd/g)U\. A parameter study is conducted on two of the case study platforms in Chapter Six, 
in order to assess the significance of this local load.
In addition to the axial capacity of the brace, it is necessary to evaluate the ability of the end 
connections to support the development of the brace’s full capacity. Tubular joint tension 
and compression capacities can be established through application of empirical formulas 
documented in API (1993). These formulas are shown below in Table 4.1, they apply to the 
different joint configurations shown in Figure 4-7.

These relationships are known to provide conservative estimates of joint capacity, especially 
forX-joints (Bea, Mortazavi, 1995).
The post-yield behavior of the joint-brace-joint system is very complex. For the purposes of 
assessment, this section will concentrate on the post-yield behavior of the brace-portion of 
the system only. It is generally accepted that joints are not desirable locations to concentrate 
damage in a structure, as their configurations give rise to stress concentrations which can lead 
to cracking and fracture at low levels of plastic strain even for low numbers of cycles. Hence, 
if the joints are the weak link in a joint-brace-joint system, the system will be assumed to 
possess no displacement tolerance beyond yield.

The behavior of braces which are alternately loaded beyond their yield and buckling 
capacities is very difficult to predict analytically. Traditionally, three approaches to modeling 
braces have been used: phenomenological models, physical models and flnite-element 
models (Zayas, et al, 1981). Phenomenological models seek to replicate or mimic the 
behavior of braces as determined from experiments, while physical models and finite-element 
models seek to duplicate brace behavior based on rigorous evaluation of the stress and strain 
states in the brace. To date, phenomenological models are still the elements of choice when 
it comes to modeling the cyclic behavior of buckling/yielding braces, as this behavior has 
proved difficult to develop practical physical elements for. In particular, the following 
phenomenon provide complications:
• The Bauschinger effect, by which the stress-strain behavior of materials becomes more 
rounded after inelastic strain reversals. This leads to a reduction in a brace’s buckling 
strength after the first cycle of buckling and then yielding in tension.
• Local buckling of the member wall when the member is placed in compression. This 
leads to localized areas of concentrated inelastic strain; repeated cycling of the member 
will cause cracking and eventual failure in the regions of local buckling.
For the purpose of performing a simplified static assessment, emphasis is placed on 
determining (1) a brace’s maximum displacement capacity prior to the occurrence of local 
buckling, and (2) the effective reduction in load capacity with cyclic inelastic straining. 
Brace load-displacement behavior will thus be represented by the envelope curve shown 
below in Figure 4-8:

Figure 4-8: Simple Hysteretic Envelope for Brace Elements
If it is determined from the static demand-capacity analysis that a brace’s compression 
capacity is exceeded by cyclic-type loads, the brace buckling strength is changed to P u - r e s ,  an 
effective reduced strength which represents the strength on subsequent cycles. The 
compression stiffness is also modified, so that the buckling displacement remains the same. 
The element has a displacement tolerance A„ in compression, which represents the point at 
which local buckling will occur, leading to severe deterioration of the member.
It is assumed for non-cyclic loading, envelope curves estimated in this manner can still be 
taken as an effective measure of the post-buckling axial load-displacement behavior of 
braces. While this approximation will be conservative for short, stocky braces (low fcl/r, 
D/t), which can exhibit a short plateau on the load-displacement curve in compression 
following buckling, it provides a very reasonable estimate of the behavior of behavior of
132

braces with more moderate length and aspect, which tend to exhibit an immediate drop in 
supportable load following buckhng.
The reduction in budding capacity of braces after one inelastic strain cycle has been studied 
by many researchers. A reduction of 20% is commonly taken, although this is very 
approximate (Astaneh, 1996). Jain, et al. (1978) proposed a reduction in strength based 
loosely on the buckling mode of the member, as represented by kUr.
The compression displacement limit for braces is estimated based on cyclic compression 
displacement ductility limits proposed by Astaneh (1996). These relate the buckling mode, 
as represented by kUr, and local buckling potential, as represented by D/t, to the maximum 
amount of displacement ductility jic which can be obtained in compression from the member 
without sever deterioration of the cross-section when subject to cyclic inelastic straining.

Beyond the cyclic ductility limit for braces in compression, the member is considered to lose 
capacity for load due to local buckling. The effective strength of the brace is assumed to vary 
linearly at from the residual value at flc to zero at 2juc in this range.
Braces which are loaded in tension are assumed to behave as elastic-plastic elements. 
Barring the presence of flaws or defects, these braces can develop very large strains prior to 
fracture. Braces in tension are assumed to have a displacement ductility of 20 for the purpose 
of assessment.
4.1.3 Pile Capacity: Lateral
The horizontal strength capacity of an imbedded pile is estimated based on the assumption 
that the supporting piles will yield by either (1) forming plastic hinges at the base of the 
jacket and at some depth below the mudline, or (2) by complete shear failure in the soil 
(Figure 4-9).

Figure 4-9: Pile Lateral Collapse Mechanism
The lateral load applied at the pile head which results in the formation of the two-hinge 
mechanism can be determined by successively checking for the location of the second plastic 
hinge which will form when the pile fails (the first is assumed to be at the base of the jacket). 
A hinge depth dhinge is initially selected, and then the lateral capacity is approximated using 
two physical relationships. The first relationship is formulated assuming the selected point is 
the point of zero shear, and hence the pile lateral capacity Pu,i can be obtained by summing up 
the incremental lateral capacity of the soil to this depth:
ps(z) = unit soil strength at depth z 
The second relationship is formulated using virtual work; the virtual displacement is the 
rotation of the second hinge:
ps{z)dz

Mu = plastic moment capacity of pile section computed using P-M  interaction 
When the values of lateral capacity calculated using the two methods are in agreement, the 
true location of the hinge has been found, and hence the two values represent the correct 
lateral capacity. If the values do no converge, the pile will fail by shearing through the soil; 
in this case, the capacity will be given by the first relationship.
Unit pile soil resistance for cohesive soils with undrained shear strength Su is taken to be:
where D is the pile diameter. This formulation is supported by studies documented by 
Matlock (1970) and Randolph and Houlsby (1984) based on results for smooth piles. Unit 
soil resistance for cohesionless soils is estimated using a relationship from Broms (1964):
y  -  submerged unit weight of the soil

Au can be expressed by:
=MP A,
where Ay is the estimated pile head lateral displacement at which plastic hinges form in the 
pile.
It is well-established that the effective lateral load-displacement behavior exhibited at the pile 
head is very sensitive to the loading rate and the amplitude and number of loading cycles 
(API, 1993). High rates of load will result in effective increases in strength and stiffness; 
repeated loadings of the pile into the inelastic regime will result in strength and stiffness 
degradation. In a static analysis of a dynamic problem, these effects must be accounted for 
implicitly. While the subject of dynamic pile response is still a subject of much active 
research, a number of empirical relationships have been developed to allow engineers to 
assess the effects of loading rate and loading cycles on pile capacity in a simplified manner. 
It is important, however, that a range of parameters be considered when making such 
approximations, given the uncertainties involved in the problem.
Bea (1986) suggests the following effective increase in pile lateral (and axial) strength due to 
high rates of loading:
& = l  + Flog ' s '

tr and ts are respectively the dynamic loading rate and static or reference loading rate at which 
the pile capacity was first estimated (this is the loading rate associated with the evaluation of 
soil properties); both expressed in terms of percent of baseline pile capacity loaded per unit 
time. F  is an empirical factor representing the rate at which stiffness and strength increase or 
decrease per log cycle change in the loading rate; it is in the range of 0.01 to 0.03 for sands, 
0.02 to 0.07 for silts, and 0.02 to 0.12 for clays. For loading rates associated with 
earthquakes, effective increases in pile lateral capacity of 50% to 100% could be obtained, 
depending on the soil surrounding the pile.
Piles which are cycled below their ultimate capacity tend to exhibit little degradation in 
strength and stiffness (Bea, 1986). However, piles loaded beyond their ultimate capacity, i.e. 
into the gross inelastic regime, will progressively deteriorate with each load cycle, due to 
changes in soil properties and the formation of gaps between the pile and soil. This loss in 
strength can be expressed by:
y/ is referred to as the strength degradation factor, and represents the ratio of the measured 
percentage change in soil strength to the measured percentage change in soil stiffness; yf is 
determined from tests for a range of cycles and strains. 8  is referred to as the degradation 
index, and is a ratio of the secant shear modulus for a given cycle to the secant shear modulus 
for the first cycle. 8  is also determined from tests for a range of strain levels. In lieu of 
estimating the number and magnitude of inelastic loading cycles, the effects of degradation 
can be bounded by using fully-cycled soil properties to estimate the pile strength and

stiffness; pile stiffness is assumed to decrease in direct proportion with pile strength. It is 
important to note that the ductility capacity of the pile will not change in this case, as the pile 
hinge rotation yield displacement remains the same.
4.1.4 Pile Capacity: Axial
The procedure by which the axial capacities Pz of piles are determined is straightforward: the 
individual soil layer friction contributions and, for the case of compression loading, the 
bottom layer end-bearing capacities, are determined and then summed; Pz is taken as the 
minimum of either this sum or the pile yield strength FyA:
Pz = qAp -  wLp + £  f ( z ) A sdz
where:
q = normal end yield force per unit of pile-end area 
/  = shear yield force per unit of embedded shaft surface area
Ap = area of pile tip
As = embedded shaft surface area per unit length of pile 
A = steel cross-section area of pile 
Lp = pile length
w = weight of pile and soil plug per unit length 
The end-bearing capacity can only be mobilized when the friction capacity of the internal soil 
plug exceeds the end-bearing capacity.
The bearing strength q of cohesive soil with undrained shear strength Su is:

The ultimate shaft friction is estimated from the following relationship:

pressure at the pile tip. The unit shaft resistance per unit length of pile is taken to be:

The unit shaft resistance and unit end-bearing capacity cannot increase indefinitely with pile 
penetration; the following limiting values for Nq, q and /  are used from Focht and Kraft 
(1986):

Providing the mechanism by which the pile yields involves yielding of the soil and not the 
yielding of the pile steel, there is no effective limit to the axial displacement ductility. Hence, 
limits on the axial yielding of piles will be established from consideration of the overall 
stability of the platform system.
As with lateral loading of piles, the axial strength and stiffness measured at the pile head are 
dependent upon both loading rate and magnitude and number of loading cycles. The same 
approximations used to account for dynamic effects on pile lateral capacity can be used to 
adjust the static axial capacity of piles (Bea, 1986).
4.1.5 Conductors. Mats and Mudline Braces
In addition to the support provided by piles, a fixed offshore platform can also benefit from
the resistance provided by well conductors, mud mats and mudline braces. While it is
common for engineers to consider the strength and stiffness of conductors and mud mats in
141

the design of modem platforms for all conditions, these elements were typically neglected in 
earlier designs when considering environmental load cases such as storms and earthquakes. 
The neglect of these elements, together with conservative modeling of pile-soil interaction, 
has lead to the belief in the offshore engineering community that many early jacket-type 
platform foundations are weak and very flexible.
Historical performance of platforms continues to demonstrate the robustness of marine 
foundations for older platforms; investigations performed by Bea, et al. (1997) and Stear and 
Bea (1997A) on platforms subjected to intense storms, for example, have demonstrated that 
use of current API pile-soil interaction design guidelines and the neglect of mudline element 
action in reassessment will lead to substantial under-prediction of platform foundation 
capacities. In addition, vibration field data recorded by Ruhl (1976) and Mason, et al. (1989) 
confirm that mudline elements greatly increase the effective lateral and rotational (rocking) 
stiffness of platform foundations; differences in design fundamental lateral periods and field 
measured fundamental lateral periods of 100% or more have been noted by these two 
sources.
Due to the significant effects these elements can have on global platform strength, simple 
approximations are included in this chapter for accounting for their effects. Expressions for 
the effective stiffness of these elements have been included in Chapter Three.
Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.
Conductors are treated as piles which offer lateral support only. This is due to the fact that 
conductors due not generally have strong or stiff vertical connections to the platform 
structure.
Mud mat and mudline brace foundation capacity contributions are determined using 
approaches suggested by Section 6.13 of API RP 2A-WSD (1993) for mat foundations. It is 
assumed that these elements are very strong and stiff compared to the underlying soil; hence 
strengths will be dictated by the soil properties. Bearing and sliding capacities for these 
elements are determined using the following:
For elements founded on cohesive soils (clays):
Q = 5.14cA maximum bearing strength
H = cA maximum sliding strength
where:
c = undrained shear strength of soil 
A = foundation contact area
For elements founded on cohesionless soils (sands):
Q = 0.3) 'BNyA maximum bearing strength
H  = c'A + Q tan 0 ’ maximum sliding strength
where:
Y  — effective unit weight of soil
143

B = m inim um lateral foundation dimension, assumed to be unity 
Nr = 2(Nq + l)tan 0 ’
Nq = (exp\/r tan ̂ ’])(tan 2 (45°-t-0’/2))
= effective friction angle of Mohr envelope 
c '  — effective cohesion intercept of Mohr envelope, assumed 0 for sand 
A = foundation area
The lateral capacity provided by mudline elements is taken as the product of the contact areas 
of all mats and mudline braces (the contact areas for braces are assumed to be DL) with the 
soil sliding and bearing strength. It is assumed that mats and mudline braces actively 
contribute to bearing strength only when placed in compression; i.e. they do not provide 
support against uplift.
Conductors are assumed to exhibit the same inelastic performance as piles, and have similar 
ductility limits derived on the basis of critical hinge rotations. The inelastic sliding and 
bearing behavior of mats and mudline braces is complex, but similar to the behavior of piles 
and conductors; these elements will exhibit effective increases in strength and stiffness for 
high rates of load, and decreases in strength and stiffness for cyclic inelastic loading, 
primarily due to the sensitivity of soil material properties to these load characteristics. Limits 
on the maximum tolerable inelastic displacements associated with these elements will be 
derived from considerations of the overall stability of the platform system.

It is emphasized that these approximate element strengths are intended to allow an engineer 
to assess the possible significance of additional foundation capacity from elements other than 
piles. The true contributions to foundation strength o f conductors, mudline braces, and mud 
mats will also depend upon the strength and stiffness of the connections and other elements 
which may be in the load path between the element and the platform structure; no provisions 
for checking the capacities of these connections and additional elements are provided in this 
document.
4.2 COMPONENT STRENGTHS AND GLOBAL STRENGTH
The process of determining platform global strength and displacement ductility begins with 
the determination of the strength capacities of platform components: lateral load capacities 
for the deck bay, the jacket bays, and the foundation lateral mechanism and moment capacity 
for the foundation overturning mechanism. Based on a comparison of the resulting 
component strength capacity profile with a specified pattern of loads, likely platform collapse 
mechanisms and the lateral load level which initiates these mechanisms can be identified.
In this section, load capacities for the different platform components are formulated using the 
element strength capacities described in Section 4.1. These capacities are formulated 
including the effects of P-A strength reduction and batter force strength increase. The 
component capacities are then related to the global strength of the platform.

4.2.1 Unbraced Deck Bay Strength
Unbraced bays are assumed to behave like portal frames which form hinges in the supporting 
columns. The strength capacity of an unbraced bay will be reached when plastic hinges have 
formed in all of the supporting legs, as shown in Figure 4-10:

VpA is the additional shear force due to first-order P-A effects:

where A is the lateral displacement of the bay needed to form a fully-plastic mechanism. 
This displacement will consist of two parts: the bending deflection of the legs in the unbraced 
bay, and an associated rigid body component due to the rotation of the leg cross-sections at 
the bottom o f the bay, as shown in Figure 4-11.
An equivalent rotational stiffness k^ug at the bottom of each unbraced leg which accounts for 
rotation of the cross-section due to bending and from deflection of the braced section beneath 
the bay can be estimated by (Bea, Mortazavi, 1995):

4.2.2 Braced Bay Strength
The shear force which can be resisted by a braced bay is dependent on the axial tension and 
compression capacities of the bracing members and their connections to the jacket legs. A 
mechanism is assumed to form in the bay when the first member in the load path fails (Figure 
4-12). The shear force capacity Pubay of a braced jacket bay will be given by:

If there is an unbraced portal above a braced section, such as an unbraced deck bay or a bay 
in which the braces have collapsed due to large displacements, there can be significant 
reduction in the capacity of the braced section due to the need to balance the large bending 
moments in the legs of the unbraced section, as shown in Figure 4-13. This can be accounted 
for by further reducing the shear capacity of the braced section by the effective shear needed 
to balance the leg moments induced by the deflection of the portal frame. This reduction

This effective reduction in capacity is not considered between braced bays; however, if a 
braced bay is subject to large displacements (large enough to damage the braces in the bay), 
depending on the size of the legs the leg moments at the base of the damage bay can become 
large enough to cause significant reduction in the capacity of the next bay down. This can 
lead to progressive collapse of braces in bays beneath the first bay to be damaged.

As P-A effects are usually quite small for braced bays, they are neglected in this formulation. 
The effective lateral strength contribution of the jacket legs in bending is typically neglected; 
however, some platforms have unusually massive legs which will offer substantial 
contributions to capacity even at small bay displacements. Based on a limited study of jacket 
bay sections, the approximate increase in bay capacity due to bending action of the legs cane

4.2.3 Foundation Lateral and Overturning Capacity
In addition to lateral collapse mechanisms which may form in the jacket and deck bay, it is 
also possible for a collapse mechanism to form in the foundation based on the hinging of all 
piles and conductors, and the sliding of all mudline elements (Figure 4-14):

The strength of this mechanism is assumed to be controlled by hinge formation in the piles.

The last mechanism considered is that of foundation overturning or rotation. The rotation

capacity will be given by:

The deflections A,- are those associated with platform response to first mode forces.
4.2.4 Global Strength
As noted previous, the global strength of the platform is defined as the total load or base 
shear the platform is subject to when the first occurrence of component yielding takes place. 
This is determined by comparing the component strengths with the reference load pattern, 
and scaling the load pattern up or down to achieve the result of first component yield, as 
shown in Figure 4-15.

The reference load pattern is taken to be those forces associated with first horizontal mode 
response. It must be emphasized that including higher mode contributions to response can 
obviously result in component yielding at lower levels of the reference base shear than the 
reference base shear determined using first mode forces alone, and can result in yielding in 
components different from the yielding pattern established using first mode forces. This will 
be a function of the relative modal participation factors for the different component demands, 
the phasing between modal responses, and the earthquake response spectrum ordinates 
associated with the higher modes. Hence, upper and lower bounds on the global strength of 
the platform should be determined. The upper-bound strength is assumed to be that 
determined from application of first mode forces only, while the lower bound strength is that 
estimated using responses which include higher mode contributions.

4.3 GLOBAL DISPLACEMENT DUCTILITY
The global displacement ductility of a platform or other structure can be established from 
static pushover analysis. Using a specific load pattern, the deck or roof is forced to displace 
until either unacceptable damage has occurred to a gravity support, or another pre-defmed 
displacement limit has been reached. The load-displacement curve developed from this 
analysis can be taken to represent the envelope on global hysteretic behavior of the structure.
There exist today many capable static pushover analysis programs such as DRAIN, CAP and 
USFOS. To apply them to the task of determining the global displacement ductility of a 
platform requires considerable time and effort, and is therefore inappropriate at the early 
stages of assessment. A simple approach is needed by which an analyst can quickly assess 
which portions of a platform are likely to yield, and what displacement ductility those 
components are capable of developing.
In this section, an approximate approach for assessing the global displacement ductility of 
platforms is described. Damage is assumed to concentrate in components of the platform 
which undergo yielding. Hence, the post-yield load-displacement behavior of a platform is 
assumed to be controlled by the load-displacement behavior of the component which yields 
first: the deck bay, the jacket, or the foundation.
4.3.1 Simplified Limit Ductility Analysis
The process by which the global displacement ductility of a platform is estimated is referred
to as Simplified Limit Ductility (SLD) Analysis. The process is outlined as follows:
154
Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.
• From the global load-strength capacity comparison, determine the most heavily loaded 
component. This component is assumed to control the ductile behavior of the platform.
• Using the simplified flexibility model developed in Chapter Three, determine the deck
displacement for the specified load pattern, with the load scaled such that the
demand/capacity ratio for the identified critical component is unity.
• If. the component is of a type which will exhibit some reserve strength following yield, 
linearly scale up the displacements associated with all non-yielding components 
according to the reserve strength which can be developed. Add to this value the inelastic 
displacement of the yielding component, assuming it develops its full displacement 
ductility. The resulting total displacement is the displacement ductility of the platform. 
Increase the effective global load at this point such that the demand/capacity ratio for the 
identified critical component at its reserve strength value is unity. Refer to Figure 4-16 
for an illustration.
• If the component is of a type which will exhibit a loss of strength or plastic behavior
following yield, the nonyielding components are assumed to be “frozen;” add to the yield
deck displacement the inelastic displacement of the yielding component, assuming it 
develops its full displacement ductility. Decrease the global load associated with post­
yield behavior by the amount of lost load capacity associated with the component. Refer 
to Figures 4-17 and 4-18 for illustrations.
This procedure allows an analyst to quickly assess the approximate global displacement
ductility a platform possesses based on the displacement ductility of its components.

Yielding which occurs in an unbraced deck bay or the foundation can be treated in a straight­
forward manner. Yielding in a jacket, however, is generally much more complicated, due to 
the mechanism by which load is redistributed as members buckle. In lieu of rigorously 
modeling the load transfer process of a jacket, several additional approximations are utilized 
to capture the behavior of jackets which have weak members with poor post-buckling
performance and/or insufficient horizontal framing for load redistribution.

4.3.2 Inelastic Behavior of Jacket Structures
The jacket-portions of most platforms designed and built in the past twenty years tend to be 
very robust structures, with the designs benefiting from industry experience established in the 
years prior to that time. Most of these structures are made up of tubular members with low 
kL/r and D/t ratios, adequate horizontal framing exists between jacket bays to ensure loads 
can be redistributed to the foundation without losses in global lateral strength, and the use of 
weak-beam K-type bracing is largely avoided.
However, many older structures have tubular members with poor post-buckling behavior, do 
not possess strong horizontal framing between jacket bays, and the use of K-type bracing was 
common up until the early 1970’s. These structures tend to exhibit losses in lateral strength 
following global yielding.
Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.
As discussed in Chapter Two, numerous studies have been performed on the load- 
displacement behavior of frames of these types. From these studies, the following 
conclusions can be drawn:
• Low D/t and kU r  ratios generally indicate tubular members with very favorable post- 
buckling performance, i.e. strength does not degrade and local buckling is avoided. 
Platforms with braces which exhibit poor post-buckling behavior will often develop weak 
story-type mechanisms, leading to damage concentrated at a single level.
• Horizontal framing substantially improves the post-yield load-displacement behavior of 
platforms. Structures with insufficient horizontal framing can exhibit “unzipping” 
behavior, which occurs when a bracing member looses strength, and there is no 
continuous load path to members below the failed member. These other members will 
then go unutilized, leading to an effective drop in load capacity of the next section down. 
This will result in the formation of weak story mechanisms in the jacket frame, and 
damage will likely concentrate in these regions, as shown in Figure 4-19.

• Structures which possess K-type framing of the type shown in Figure 4-20 exhibit sudden 
reductions in strength following the buckling of braces. This will occur if the horizontal 
member or K-joint cannot support the imbalance in vertical load which results when one 
brace buckles and the other is in tension. If a hinge forms in the horizontal, the tension 
member will be unable to develop its full tension capacity, and the main source of energy 
dissipation will be the hinge in the horizontal. This will result in a drop in effective 
strength of the frame, and damage concentration will likely occur in the section.
In lieu of rigorously tracking the load redistribution associated with buckling of braces in 
jackets with weak framing through static pushover analysis, it is desirable to first apply a 
qualitative procedure to quickly evaluate the potential loss in strength following member 
buckling. To assist in the development of such an approach, the post-yield behavior of ten 
jacket structures was examined. These jackets had been previously analyzed using static 
pushover analysis by Gates, et al. (1977), Bea, et al. (1997), Bea, et al. (1995), Stear and Bea 
(1997A) and Hellan, et al. (1993). All platforms possessed diagonal bracing members with 
D/t between 30 to 70 and kL/r between 40 and 80. Table 4-4 depicts the global 
characteristics of these jackets and results from the analyses.

Residual strength for these structures was seen to vary from 60% to 100% of the initial yield 
load. Most of the jackets in Table 4-4 were able to develop global displacement ductilities of 
two or more following yielding, prior to formation of hinges in the legs. Where weak K-type 
bracing was associated with the failure mechanism, the structural system tended to exhibit 
losses in supportable lateral load of 30% to 40%. For platforms lacking sufficient horizontal 
framing, drops in supportable load ranged from 30% to 10%.

To implicitly account for the effects of having minimum horizontal framing or weak-beam K-
bracing, a set of approximate guidelines was developed based on the platforms in Table 4-4:
•  A weak-story mechanism is assumed to occur at the location of the bracing system in
question; displacement will be concentrated in this mechanism.
Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.
• For platforms with eight or more legs, the post-yield strength of a K-brace mechanism is 
estimated assuming tension members can only develop 60%  capacity, while the post-yield 
strength of a mechanism in a structure with otherwise insufficient horizontal framing is 
estimated assuming tension members can only develop 80%  capacity. This is done to 
qualitatively represent the fact that tension members in sections of these types are unable 
to develop their full tension capacities due to a lack of load path redundancy.
• For platforms with fewer than eight legs, the post-yield strength of a K-brace mechanism 
and the post-yield strength of a mechanism in a structure with otherwise insufficient 
horizontal framing  is estimated assuming tension members can only develop 60%  
capacity. This is done to qualitatively represent the fact that tension members in sections 
of these types are unable to develop their full tension capacities due to a lack of load path 
redundancy, and that there is less redundancy in these more minimal structures.
It must be recognized that this approach is quite approximate, and to qualitatively establish 
the likely post-yield characteristics of a jacket without resorting to static pushover analysis. 
In all likelihood damage will not exclusively concentrate in the first bay to fail; in several of 
the jackets listed in Table 4-4, the collapse mechanism was spread over two or more bays. 
However, by assuming damage is limited to one bay, a conservative estimate of the 
associated displacement ductility can be made.
Adequacy of horizontal framing can be challenging to judge without a complete model of the 
horizontal frame. The ability of the horizontal member of a K-brace to transfer load without

hinging can be determined by analyzing the member as a beam column as in Section 4.1.1; 
the “lateral” load capacity of the horizontal should be greater than the vertical component of 
the unbalanced tension load in one brace resulting from the complete collapse of the other in 
buckling. For a conservative screening, horizontal members in single and X-brace 
configurations should be able to develop the tension capacity of members above and below 
them in the load path, to provide load path redundancy when compression members fail.
For jackets which have robust horizontal framing, but are not redundant to the point where 
they exhibit reserve strength, damage is assumed to concentrate in the jacket, but is 
distributed across bays. The displacements in the jacket are assumed to vary linearly with the 
displacement in the yielding portion of the jacket, up until the cyclic displacement ductility 
limits of the braces in the yielding portion are exceeded, representing local buckling and 
rapid degradation of capacity.
4.3.3 Foundation Rotation Limit
If the mechanism which forms is that of foundation rotation, the governing performance 
criteria will be that of overall stability, as opposed to that of loss of strength in vertical load- 
supporting members. This is due to the fact that the piles due not suffer permanent 
degradation when subject to inelastic straining, so long as the yielding is occurring in the 
surrounding soil. In theory the platform could survive drifts up to the point at which the P-A 
moment equals the moment capacity of the foundation; obviously, however, this provides no 
margin for safety. Prior to approaching this point, it is very likely that severe damage will

have occurred to mudiine structural elements such as mats and braces, and to conductors, 
piping and other mudiine equipment from the amount of rotation.
Current design practice generally limits plasticity in foundation overturning to ductility 
demands which will occur in the piles in forming a fully-plastic foundation mechanism. This 
is typically indicated by the yielding of one or two piles in compression. It is important, 
however, to consider P-A effects which will occur associated with these displacements. 
Platform deck drift levels at foundation rotation yield and at formation of a plastic foundation 
rotation mechanism (assuming the foundation rotates as a rigid plate, and the steel structure 
above the mudiine behaves as a rigid body) are shown below in Table 4-5 for eight platforms:

The deck drift associated with yielding in the foundation is in the range of 0.22% to 0.64%, 
with a mean of 0.39%, while the drift associated with formation of a fully-plastic mechanism 
is in the range of 0.38% to 1.28%, with a mean of 0.79%. The moment induced at the base 
from P-A effects at mechanism formation is at most 1.03% of the base plastic moment 
capacity for the platforms studied, the mean value of this fraction is 0.43%.
163

Based on the platforms examined, a limit of 1% deck drift due to foundation rotation will be 
used in this assessment criteria. For platforms of similar design, this restriction will keep the 
moment induced by P-A effects to approximately 1% of the foundation plastic moment 
capacity.
4.3.4 Residual Strength Requirement
There exist no definitive guidelines on the minimum amount of residual strength a platform 
should possess following a severe seismic event. However, it is obvious that some margin 
must be provided for, to protect against aftershocks and other environmental forces. Zayas, 
et al. (1980A) suggested a reserve lateral load capacity of 70% of ultimate load for illustrative 
purposes when discussing an example frame subject to cyclic inelastic loading; this criteria, 
while recognized as subjective, will be adopted here as a minimum requirement for 
robustness. Platforms not meeting this criteria should be considered extreme liabilities for 
severe earthquakes.
4.4 EXAMPLE APPLICATIONS
The simplified strength and displacement ductility assessment approaches described in the
previous sections were applied to the analysis of four structures: two 8-leg Gulf of Mexico
platforms analyzed by Stear and Bea (1997A), and two three-bay X-braced frames tested at
U.C. Berkeley by Zayas, et al. (1980A). The cases selected emphasize failure occurring in
the jacket portions of each structure. The two Gulf of Mexico platforms have weak
horizontal framing and bracing members with poor post-buckling performance. The two X-
braced frames have strong horizontal framing, but differ in bracing member strength and

post-buckling performance. For each case, comparisons were made between the effective 
global strength, indicated failure mechanism, global displacement ductility, and general shape 
of the hysteresis curve determined from the simplified approaches and the results from the 
two listed investigations.
4.4.1 Case A: South Pass 62 A
South Pass 62 A is an 8-leg jacket located in the Gulf of Mexico (Figure 4-21). Braces in the 
platform have high D/t (50+) and kL/r (80+) ratios, indicative of poor post-buckling 
performance.

This platform has been extensively analyzed by Stear and Bea (1997A) using the program 
USFOS.
Ultimate strength (static pushover) analyses were performed for two cases of loading for this 
structure: wave attack on the end-on axis and wave attack on the broadside axis. The 
resulting global-load displacement curves for each load case, together with the collapse 
mechanisms which formed, are shown in Figures 4-22 and 4-23.
For the case of end-on loading, collapse was initiated by the buckling of braces in the fourth 
jacket bay, followed by the buckling of braces in the third jacket bay. The platform exhibited 
a sudden loss in strength, characteristic of “unzipping” due to lack of load path redundancy; 
tension braces in these two bays were unable due to develop full capacity. The platform 
exhibited a global strength of approximately 7,400 kips, and exhibited severely degrading 
global load-displacement behavior. Residual strength varied from 4,300 kips to 6,200 kips. 
R inging  of the platform legs in the weakened region at a global displacement ductility of

For the case of broadside loading, collapse was initiated by the buckling of a compression
brace in the second jacket bay, following which two of the remaining braces in the bay
developed their plastic (tension) capacities; the remaining brace was unable to mobilize its
full tension capacity. The platform exhibited a moderate loss in strength following the
buckling of the compression brace in this bay; damage concentrated in this bay until hinging
of the legs and buckling of other members began at a global displacement ductility of

approximately two. Global load capacity was determined to be 9,500 kips; residual strength 
varied from 8,500 kips to 9,100 kips while inelasticity was confined to this bay.

This platform was also analyzed using the simplified procedures described previously in this 
chapter and in Chapter Three. Strength capacities were first formulated for components for 
both the end-on and broadside direction. A demand-capacity assessment was then conducted, 
using a load pattern matching that used in the static pushover analyses representative of the 
wind, wave and current forces. Strength demand-capacity curves are shown below in Figures 
4-24 and 4-25.
The end-on assessment indicates the platform will collapse by forming a mechanism in the 
second jacket bay; however, the third and fourth bays are also close to collapse. The collapse 
load is approximately 7,450 kips. The trend in collapse behavior is comparable to that found 
from the static pushover analysis; the collapse load estimates between the two methods are in 
excellent agreement.
The broadside assessment indicates the platform will collapse by forming a mechanism in the 
second jacket bay; the first bay is also close to collapse while the deck bay legs are close to 
yielding. The collapse load is approximately 7,800 kips. The trend in collapse behavior 
compares well with that identified in the static pushover analysis; the predicted collapse load 
is 18% less than that found from the static pushover analysis.
The procedures of Chapter Three were used to develop flexibility matrices for the structure
for both the end-on and broadside directions; using these matrices together with load vectors
representative of the end-on and broadside loads, the deck displacements at collapse initiation
were estimated. As this structure does not possess horizontal framing at all levels, it was

judged to fall into the category of minimum or weak horizontal framing. Hence, damage was 
assumed to concentrate in the first jacket bays to yield. Using the post-buckling performance 
of braces in each of the weakest bays, and assuming the braces in tension also lose capacity 
due to lack of load path redundancy, envelope curves were constructed for both the end-on 
and broadside directions of loading (see Figure 4-26).

indicates 2.1 and 1.7 for the end-on and broadside cases.

Ship Shoal 274A is an 8-leg jacket located in the Gulf of Mexico (Figure 4-27). Braces in 
this platform have moderate D/t (30 to 60) and kL/r ratios (60+), indicating moderate post- 
buckling performance. This platform has been extensively analyzed by Stear and Bea

This platform was also analyzed using the simplified procedures described in this chapter and 
Chapter Three. Strength demand-capacity curves are shown in Figures 4-30 and 4-31, while 
load-displacement behavior is shown in 4-32.
For the case of end-on loading, collapse was initiated by the buckling of braces in the third 
jacket bay, following by the buckling of braces in the fourth jacket bay. The platform 
exhibited a progressive loss in strength, characteristic of gradual unzipping. The platform 
exhibited a global strength of approximately 4,570 kips. Residual strength was tracked as 
low as 3,800 kips; the analysis was terminated prior to the formation of hinges in the legs.
The end-on assessment indicates the platform will collapse by forming a mechanism in the 
third jacket bay; the fourth jacket bay is also very close to failure. The collapse load is 
approximately 4,410 kips. The simplified ductility analysis for this direction of load 
indicates the platform has a residual strength ratio of approximately 66%, and is capable of 
developing a global displacement ductility of approximately 1.7 prior to hinging of the legs. 
The strength and identified collapse mechanism are in excellent agreement with those found 
during the static pushover analysis; the load-displacement behavior compares reasonably well 
to that found from the static pushover analysis.
The broadside assessment indicates the platform will collapse by forming a mechanism in the 
third jacket bay; however, the remaining jacket bays and the deck bay are also very close to 
failure. The collapse load is approximately 5,050 kips. The simplified ductility analysis for 
this direction of load indicates the platform has a residual strength ratio of approximately

66%, and is capable of developing a global displacement ductility of approximately 1.5 prior 
to hinging of the legs. The strength and identified collapse mechanism are in excellent 
agreement with those found during the static pushover analysis; however, the load- 
displacement behavior is predicted as being much more severely degrading than observed in 
the static pushover analysis. While it was assumed at the outset that this platform would not 
be able to transfer load due to insufficient horizontal framing, closer inspection revealed that 
the platform does possess sufficient redundancy for transferring forces from buckling 
members in the broadside direction. Furthermore, the fact that the platform does not have 
any obvious weak sections allows likely damage to be distributed over multiple bays.

For comparison purposes, the global load-displacement behavior of the platform in the 
broadside direction was also estimated assuming damage was distributed in the jacket prior to 
the occurrence of local buckling in a member. This plot is also shown in Figure 4-32. This 
estimate, which can be taken as an upper bound on performance, indicates the platform has a 
residual strength ratio of approximately 0.80. The global displacement ductility is also 
slightly higher, at 1.7. Overall, this upper bound result is closer to the behavior observed in 
the static pushover analysis.

4.4.3 U. C. Berkeley Test Frames
The simplified procedures developed in this chapter and Chapter Three were also applied to 
the analysis of two steel frames tested at U. C. Berkeley by Zayas, et al. (1980A). Particulars 
of the two frame models are shown in Chapter Two Figure 2-15. The frames are similar in 
overall dimensions; the difference is in the D/t ratios of the members. Frame I consists of 
members with D/t ratios of 48, while Frame II members have D/t ratios close to 33. Both 
frames have horizontal braces capable of transferring load when main diagonal members 
begin to buckle. The braces in the top K-brace panel were designed to preclude buckling 
during the test.
Both frames were subjected to a series of loading cycles with progressively increasing
displacement magnitudes. A hydraulic ram was used to induce displacement at the deck
portion of each frame, and the resulting hysteretic behavior was recorded. Hysteresis loops
for both frames are shown in Chapter Two Figure 2-16. In both frames, yielding and
buckling began in the top panel, and progressed to the bottom panel. The braces in the top
panels were subject to three or four cycles of inelastic displacement prior to moving the
frame to the point where bottom panel braces buckled. Frame I exhibited a global strength of
approximately 56.6 kips, which occurred at a global ductility of 1.51 as measured from the
incipient point of nonlinear behavior. Frame I was able to develop a global displacement
ductility of 3.1 while supporting loads up to 70% of maximum. Frame II exhibited a global
strength of 73.5 kips, which occurred at a global ductility of 1.62 as measured from the
incipient point of nonlinear behavior. Frame II was able to developed a global displacement
ductility of 5.0 while supporting loads up to 70% of maximum. Using maximum strength as
180

a reference point, Frame I can be considered to have developed a gross global ductility of 2.0, 
while Frame II developed a gross global ductility of 3.0.
The simplified procedures described in this chapter and Chapter Three were used to analyze 
the two frames. Assuming a single load applied at the top, the capacity of both frames was 
controlled by buckling of braces in the top X-braced panel bay. The maximum load for 
Frame I was estimated as 57 kips, while the maximum load for Frame II was 80 kips. These 
values are in excellent agreement with those observed during the tests.
Global load-displacement envelope curves were developed for the two frames, and are shown 
in Figure 4-33. Displacement is plotted up to the point at which the braces in the top panel 
have reached twice the displacement associated with local buckling of the compression brace 
in that panel. In both cases, damage was assumed to be distributed up until local buckling 
occurred in a member; following that damage was assumed to concentrate in the frame level. 
To be consistent with the tests, buckling was assumed to take place between the center of 
each X and the legs; while this reduces the effective buckling length dramatically, it increases 
the concentration of damage in a buckling brace, as damage is essentially confined to one- 
half of the X. Also, the lateral force induced in the bottom panel by bending of the legs in the 
top panel was artificially suppressed to avoid formation of a two-panel mechanism. This 
forces damage to concentrate in the top panel.

The envelope curves determined compare reasonably well with the hysteresis loops 
determined from the experiment. Application of the simple approach indicates Frame I is 
capable of developing a global displacement ductility of 2.1, while Frame II is indicated as 
developing a global displacement ductility of 2.3. In both cases, residual strength drops to 
approximately 70% of maximum over the full range of displacement. The results for Frame I 
are in good agreement with those from the test; the results for Frame II are somewhat 
conservative so far as displacement ductility and residual strength are concerned. This is due 
in part to the limits which are placed on the range of cyclic displacement ductility for braces 
in Section 4.1.2; in reality, the braces in Frame II were able to develop cyclic displacement 
ductilities of 7.0 and higher during the course of the tests.

4.5 SUMMARY
Simple expressions have been documented by which the basic structural elements of a 
platform, the braces, legs and piles, can be characterized in terms of stiffness, strength, cyclic 
displacement ductility and post-yield load-displacement behavior. Based on the performance 
of these elements, the platform global strength and cyclic displacement ductility can be 
assessed. The strength of the platform is determined from the first collapse mechanism to 
form in a structural component. The cyclic displacement ductility capacity of the platform is 
based on the displacement of the deck which can be reached at the point at which either 
platform stability is lost, or the point at which major gravity load-carrying members have 
their cyclic displacement ductility capacities exceeded.
Example applications of the procedures have been made for a series of four structures: two 
Gulf of Mexico jacket platforms subjected to storm loads, and two X-braced frames tested at 
U. C. Berkeley by Zayas, et al. (1980A). The procedures provide estimates of structure 
strength in good agreement with those from static pushover analysis; post-yield behavior is 
also reasonably represented. It is important, however, to recognize that the procedure by 
which global displacement ductility is estimated is very approximate; this procedure is based 
in part on observations of how damage is typically distributed in structures, and makes use of 
simplifying assumptions regarding the statics of load redistribution.
Additional case studies which demonstrate the application of these methods are contained in 
Chapter Six.

CHAPTER FIVE:
EARTHQUAKE RESPONSE O F STRENGTH AND STIFFNESS DEGRADING
HYSTERETIC SYSTEMS
5.0 INTRODUCTION
The use of load reduction factors R  in the design of structures for earthquakes was first 
proposed by Veletsos and Newmark (1960). The R factor represents the effective allowable 
reduction in elastically-determined design load for a SDOF system, given that the system is 
capable of tolerating deformations in excess of yield:
R = ^ ' "
y  )
Load reduction factors have been incorporated into most earthquake design codes, and are 
intended to allow for the design of simple buildings using elastic analysis.
These factors are established from statistical comparisons made between elastic and inelastic 
SDOF systems subject to earthquakes. Numerous studies have been performed over the years 
to determine or revise R factors for common structural systems. Much work has been 
devoted to the study of bilinear elastic-plastic or strain hardening systems, with and without 
stiffness degradation. Miranda and Bertero (1994) provide an excellent summary of previous 
studies on load reduction factors for systems of this type; these studies have indicated the 
following trends:
• The factors are strongly dependent on the period of the system (Anagnostopoulis, 1972; 
Miranda, 1991, Newmark, Hall, 1973; Riddell, Newmark, 1979; Nassar, Krawinkler,

1991; Lai, Biggs, 1980; Elghadamsi, Mohraz, 1987; Riddell, et al., 1989; Hidalgo, Arias, 
1990; Al-Sulaimani, Roessett, 1985).
• The factors are strongly dependent on the local soil conditions at the site. Factors derived 
using rock and alluvium ground motions will be quite different from those derived using 
ground motions recorded on soft soil with low shear wave velocities (Miranda, 1991).
• The factors are not dependent on the distance from the earthquake source, the earthquake 
magnitude, the strong motion duration, the focal depth of the earthquake, or the 
earthquake source mechanism (Nassar, Krawinkler, 1990; Miranda, 1991).
• The factors are not strongly dependent on the phenomenon of stiffness degradation for 
elastic-plastic and bilinear systems (Anagnostopoulis, 1972; Riddell, Newmark, 1979; 
Nassar, Krawinkler, 1990).
• The factors are not strongly dependent on the viscous damping in the structure for all but 
the shortest periods (Riddell, Newmark, 1979; Peng, et al., 1988).
As opposed to finding the mean load reduction associated with a fixed value of displacement 
ductility, it might be desirable to instead find the mean displacement ductility associated with 
a fixed value of elastic overload ratio. This relationship, referred to in this chapter as a 
displacement modification factor FA, can be used in a similar role to that of the load reduction 
factor; in lieu of making comparisons in force-space for a prescribed displacement ductility 
capacity, comparisons can be made in displacement-space for a prescribed amount of 
overload ratio between system strength and elastic force.
185

It must be recognized that these factors are random variables. Results obtained from many of 
the above studies have indicated a steady increase in variability for increasing levels of 
overload ratio or ductility demand. Miranda (1991) conducted a very thorough study of the 
statistical variability for R; statistical variability fell in the range of 20% to 50%, was mostly 
insensitive to structure period, but showed moderate dependence on increasing displacement 
ductility capacity. These results indicate the factors have consistent properties over a practical 
range and can therefore be used within bounds of statistical confidence.
Few studies, however, have been performed on the evaluation of such factors for systems 
which exhibit strength and stiffness degradation of the type associated with platform systems 
as discussed in Chapter Two. Limited studies have been performed by Anagnostopoulis 
(1972) and Al-Sulaimani and Roesset (1985); while these studies have established the 
dependence of load reduction factors on the hysteretic behavior of systems where loss of 
strength with displacement is a concern, the studies performed were limited in the number of 
trials, and hence do not provide a sufficient statistical basis for confident development of load 
reduction factors. Additional limited studies have been performed by Mahin and Boroscheck 
(1991) and MacCrae and Kawashima (1991); these studies again confirm the sensitivity of 
allowable strength reductions and associated displacement demands to degrading strength, 
but do not provide additional insight to the statistics of such systems which may be used in 
design and assessment.
This chapter documents a study performed to determine R and FA factors for SDOF systems
with hysteretic behaviors similar to those exhibited by offshore structural systems; namely,

those which exhibit strength and stiffness degradation with cycling. These factors are 
intended to be used in conjunction with the results of ultimate strength (static pushover) 
analyses and elastically-calculated loads or displacements from a response spectrum. 
Assuming the platform system is dominated largely by the first lateral modes, the capacity of 
the platform will be determined from either:
p
7 7  elastic
F* « > —
where Felas[ic is the base shear corresponding to the first mode forces determined from the 
elastic response spectrum for the level of earthquake excitation specified, and Fyieij is the 
base shear from first mode forces which results in yielding in the platform determined from 
the static pushover analysis, or:
^  collapse ^  ^  elastic
where 4?/oj;/c is the elastically-calculated deck or global displacement, and Acoiiapse is the 
maximum tolerable global displacement of the platform.
These factors allow for the implicit consideration of the dynamic behavior of the actual 
yielding system, and modify the results of a static analysis accordingly. It must be recognized 
that these factors are random variables; hence, a prime objective of the study is to establish 
the statistical properties of these factors.
In addition to determining these factors for strength and stiffness degrading systems, a 
number of comparison cases are performed in which MDOF systems with strength and 
stiffness degrading elements are analyzed using time history analysis, and then global and

local ductility demands are compared to results from use of an equivalent SDOF. These 
cases are intended to qualitatively explore the limitations of the equivalent SDOF concept.
5.1 STATISTICAL STUDY ON R AND FJ
It is instructive to review several basic behavioral characteristics of strength and stiffness 
degrading systems. Strength-degrading systems can be subject to displacement demands two 
to three times higher than those in an elastic-plastic or strain-hardening system with the same 
yield strength. However, studies conducted by Mahin and Boroscheck (1991) and others 
have demonstrated that strength degradation coupled with stiffness degradation will result in 
less significant increases in displacement demand; this behavior trend is consistent with the 
trend for elastic-plastic and strain-hardening systems with stiffness degradation to exhibit less 
displacement demand that counterpart systems without stiffness degradation. This is due in 
part to the fact that stiffness-degrading systems will accumulate permanent offset at a slower 
rate than a non-stiffness degrading system; the trend for a stiffness-degrading system is to 
return towards the initial position, thus reducing the potential to accumulate displacements by 
“ratcheting” in one direction of displacement.
Strength-degrading systems can develop a significant unbalance in directional strength after 
initially yielding in a given direction,. As observed by Newmark and Rosenblueth (1971) and 
others, systems with this type of directional strength imbalance will tend to rapidly 
accumulate displacement on the side which yields first (and hence suffers strength loss); this 
is due in part to the fact that the “strong” side stores elastic strain energy, and rebounds
188

toward the weaker side to dissipate this energy. Stiffness degradation can reduce the 
deleterious effects of this imbalance.
Another important issue for strength-degrading systems is the duration of excitation. As 
observed by Mahin (1976), systems which do not reach a plateau of strength after degradation 
are inherently unstable, and will collapse (reach zero strength) if the ground motion duration 
is sufficiently long. This is of particular importance for systems which are subject to 
significant P-A effects. While the platform systems considered in this dissertation are 
generally restricted for assessment purposes to a stable residual strength level, duration of 
shaking is still important from the standpoint that longer motions will inevitably drive the 
structural system to this residual strength.
A statistical study of nonlinear SDOF systems with strength and stiffness degrading 
hysteresis subjected to earthquakes was performed in order to determine load reduction and 
displacement modification factors. The sections below describe the systems analyzed, the 
ground motions used, and the software used to conduct the study.
5.1.1 Hysteretic Behaviors Considered
Referring back to the Figures of Section 2.5 in Chapter Two, it is clear that many platform 
systems will lose strength and stiffness with cyclic inelastic loading. As a consequence, these 
systems must be designed to higher load levels than bilinear elastic-plastic or strain- 
hardening systems, in order to keep displacement demands to similar levels.
189

Based on a qualitative review of the hysteretic behaviors associated with platform structural 
systems, it was decided to focus on two general types of degrading behavior:
• Strength and stiffness degradation, with hysteresis bounded by a trilinear envelope as 
shown in Figure 5-1. This behavior was chosen to characterize hysteresis associated with 
yielding in platform jacket structures. These systems are referred to as jacket-type or JT 
systems.
• Strength degradation alone, with the rate o f degradation dependent upon the amount of 
accumulated inelastic deformation with each cycle, as shown in Figure 5-2. This 
behavior was chosen to represent the hysteresis associated with yielding in platform 
foundations. These systems are referred to as foundation-type or FT systems.
In addition, bilinear strain-hardening behavior with and without stiffness degradation was 
also considered, for the purpose of comparison. These systems are referred to as bilinear 
degrading (BD) or bilinear non-degrading (BN) systems. The amount of strain hardening was 
kept small (3% of elastic stiffness).

Figure 5-2: FT System Hysteresis
The JT and BD systems utilize a stiffness degradation algorithm developed by Clough and 
Johnson (1967). This model is simple, and was judged to represent the cyclic behavior of 
braced frames to a reasonable degree. Other studies have experimented with models which 
exhibit “pinching” behavior as part of a stiffness degradation scheme, such as those described 
by Gates (1978); however, for the purpose of developing generic factors, it was felt that fewer 
initial variables would be best.
JT systems are controlled by two parameters: residual strength, designated Fres, and the 
displacement associated with reaching the residual strength plateau, designated Ares. Fres is 
specified as a fraction of the yield strength Fy of the system, while Ares is specified as a 
multiple of the yield displacement Ay of the system. Table 5-1 lists the JT SDOF system 
parameters which were considered in the course of the investigation. These parameters were 
selected to cover the range in degrading behavior commonly observed in braced frames, as

offshore platforms.

FT systems are also controlled by two parameters: residual strength Fres and incremental 
strength reduction X. X is used in the manner suggested by Matlock, et al. (1978) for piles to 
reduce strength with each successive cycle according to:
Strength reduction does not take place until inelastic strain reversal has occurred. The 
parameters used in the study of FT systems are shown below in Table 5-2:

BD and BL systems were analyzed for the same range of periods, ductility capacities and 
normalized yield strengths as the JT and FT systems; damping was restricted to 5%.
5.1.2 Earthquake Ground Motions Used
In the past few years significant efforts has been devoted to recording and collating 
earthquake time histories. An excellent source of records is available from the National 
Geophysical Data Center (1996); this set o f records contains over 15,000 time histories 
recorded during earthquakes occurring around the world between 1933 and 1994. While the 
vast majority of records have been recorded in the past twenty years, this set still contains 
enough variability to be adequate for general design standard development purposes. The 
records on this set are available as uncorrected time histories, corrected time histories, and 
elastic response spectra.
The development of load reduction factors and displacement modification factors was based 
on analyses conducted using 37 ground motions recorded on rock. These ground motions are 
listed in Table 5-3. In selecting these ground motions, effort was made to use many of the 
same ground motions utilized as part of a previous study conducted by Miranda (1991). This 
was deemed desirable as it provides a source for qualitative comparison of the results 
generated by this current study. Initially, use of corrected acceleration records as described 
by Naeim and Anderson (1993) was planned for the study; however, uncorrected acceleration 
records were eventually decided upon for three reasons: (1) uncorrected records were used by 
Miranda (1991), (2) the method of correction is known to change the character, in some cases

substantially, of these records, depending on the correction method, and (3) several of the 
corrected records were found to contain data errors.

As an important issue for strength-degrading systems is the duration of excitation, effort was 
made to select motions which were recorded during long-duration events. As observed by 
Mahin (1976), systems which do not reach a plateau of strength after degradation are 
inherently unstable, and will collapse (i.e. reach zero strength) if the ground motion duration

is sufficiently long. While the platform systems considered in this dissertation are generally 
restricted for assessment purposes to a stable residual strength level, duration of shaking is 
still important from the standpoint that longer motions will inevitably drive the structural 
system to this residual strength.
In addition, two additional sets o f ground motions, 31 recorded on alluvium and 24 recorded 
on soft soil were also used for limited studies of the effects of local soil conditions on these 
factors. These ground motions are listed in Tables 5-4 and 5-5; these studies are discussed in 
Section 5.4.
5.1.3 Software Used in Study
Performance of this study involves use of software which is capable of solving the 
differential equation governing the motion of an inelastic viscously-damped SDOF system 
subjected to time-varying ground acceleration: 
mii(t)+ cu(t)+ = —miig (t)
where:
m = mass
c = damping coefficient, Aitm^T 
and k is the displacement-varying restoring force coefficient. In an elastic system, k is 
constant.

Many programs have been developed over the years to solve this relationship using numerical 
step-by-step integration. These programs can be divided up into two categories: academic 
programs and commercial programs.
The academic programs are freely available; however, they are usually written in older code 
(Fortran) and have not been maintained over time. As such, they will not always function 
predictably with today’s PC operating systems (Win95 and Windows NT). One of the better 
known academic programs is NONSPEC, developed by Lin and Mahin (1983). This 
program has spawned a number of others such as NLSPECTRA (Miranda, 1991), NOSPEC 
(Khatib, et al., 1988) and PCNSPEC (Boroscheck, 1991). All of these programs perform the 
required integration using the linear acceleration method (Newmark, 1959). Equilibrium 
violations due to changes in the displacement-varying restoring force within a time step are 
minimized by varying the integration time step and by enforcing equilibrium by modifying 
the acceleration at the end of the step.
It is also possible to make use of a variety of commercial nonlinear dynamic structural 
analysis programs such as DRAIN (Powell, 1993), PC-ANSR (Maison, 1990), and ID ARC 
(Reinhom, 1995) to perform studies of this type. This approach offers the advantage of using 
software which usually has more rigorous quality standards. However, these programs must 
be controlled in a batch execution mode in order to perform the number of calculations 
required; this can become quite cumbersome, as the input file for the program must be 
rewritten each time another iteration is desired.

To perform this study, it was decided to upgrade the old NONSPEC code to a more modem 
environment. PCNSPEC was translated from Fortran to MS Visual Basic, and modified to 
allow for the analysis of SDOF systems with hysteretic behavior appropriate to JT and FT 
systems. This new program, JINSPEC, was then used to carry out the statistical studies 
documented in Section 5.2.
5.2 RESULTS OF STATISTICAL STUDIES
The main goals of the statistical studies were to develop load reduction factors and 
displacement modification factors for SDOF systems which exhibit hysteretic behavior 
similar to that of jacket-type platforms. Overall, 68,816 SDOF system — ground motion 
combinations were analyzed. Results from the studies are broken up into three sections, each 
associated with the different systems (BD/BN, JT, FT) studied. Each section contains mean 
load reduction factors, mean displacement response factors, and coefficients of variation for 
the different factors appropriate to the individual systems. The results for BD, JT and FT 
systems are compared to results from BN systems, in order to assess the differences between 
these degrading systems and convention bilinear systems.
5.2.1 BD/BN SDOF Systems
Results for BN systems are shown in Figures 5-3 to 5-6, and results for BD systems are 
shown in Figures 5-7 to 5-10. The BN system analysis confirms trends for bilinear non­
degrading systems which have been identified in previous analysis, namely:
• The mean load reduction in design force permitted by nonlinear behavior is bounded over 
most of the period range by 1///.
199
Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.
• The mean ratio between elastic and inelastic displacements is approximately one over 
most of the period range.
These trends begin to change for periods in the range of 0.5 sec to 1.0 sec, most noticeably 
for systems forced to develop higher ductility.
Comparison of the BN and BD load reduction and displacement modification factors reveals 
that stiffness degradation does noticeably change the character of these factors. Load 
reduction factors are approximately 10% to 20% greater for the BD system, whereas 
displacement modification factors are smaller by a similar proportion. Trends in variability 
between the different factors, however, are similar; coefficients of variation range from 10% 
to as high as 45%.

5.2.2 JT SDOF Systems
Results for JT systems are shown in Figures 5-11 to 5-42. The results are matched to each 
type of JT system using a five-digit code. The first three digits describe the point at which 
the negative slope on the envelop intersects the residual strength. The last two digits describe 
the residual strength as a percentage of initial yield strength.
JT systems show marked reductions in load reduction factors, and corresponding increases in 
displacement modification factors, as compared to BN systems. The most severely degrading 
system, JT11060 (5-39 to 5-42), exhibits strength reduction factors which are 20% to 30% 
less than those of BN systems, while displacement modification factors are inmost cases 40%

systems is moderately higher than that for the BN systems.

5.2.3 FT SDOF Systems
Results for FT systems are shown in Figures 5-43 to 5-50. The results are matched to each 
type of FT system using a four-digit code. The first two digits describe the strength reduction 
factor X. The last two digits describe the residual strength as a percentage of initial yield 
strength.
The FT systems tend to exhibit severe changes in load reduction and displacement 
modification as compared to BN systems. For the most severely degrading system, FT4060 
(Figures 5-51 to 55-54), load reduction factors are perhaps 40% less than their BN system 
counterparts, whereas displacement modification factors are on the order of 60% higher. 
This difference is most severe in the period range from 0.5 sec to 1.0 sec. These systems, 
unlike their stiffness-degrading counterparts, are unable to permanently alter flexibility, and 
thus escape peaks in the spectral response. Also, they accumulate permanent offsets at a 
greater rate, and thus will accumulate displacements by ratcheting more readily than stiffness- 
degrading systems. Of the behaviors studied, FT exhibits the most limited post-yield 
behavior.

5.3 ADDITIONAL PARAMETER STUDIES
In addition to determining load reduction factors for a variety of degrading systems, three 
additional parameter studies were conducted: (I) an evaluation of the significance of 
damping on factor values, (2) evaluation of the sensitivity of factors to local soil conditions, 
and (3) a comparison of the results of the load reduction factors study with current simple 
methods of estimating appropriate load reduction for degrading systems. Each of these 
studies is described in the following subsections.
5.3.1 Effects of Damping on Load Reduction Factors
The sensitivity o f load reduction factors to viscous damping in a SDOF system has been 
previously studied by other researchers, and the effect has been found to be negligible for 
systems permitted to develop ductilities greater than two or three. However, many platform 
systems are not expected to possess the capability of developing global displacement ductility 
much larger than this, so the effect on load reduction factors for platform systems could be 
significant.
To evaluate the significance of damping, three systems were studied with increased viscous 
damping: BN, JTI1060 and FT4060. BN was used as a base case, while the most severely 
degrading JT and FT systems were chosen. These systems were modified to allow for 
viscous damping o f 10% critical, and then analyzed for the earthquakes listed in Table 5-3. 
The resulting mean load reduction factors are shown in Figures 5-59, 5-60 and 5-61.
230

Similar changes in load reduction factors are observed for all three systems. Systems capable 
of developing a displacement ductility of two see an increase in allowable load reduction of 
between 10% and 15% relative to load reduction factors calculated using the baseline 5% 
damping used in the studies. Systems capable o f developing ductilities higher than this 
value, however, do not exhibit a significant change in load reduction. This is undoubtedly 
due to the fact that systems designed to yield significantly (i.e. with high displacement 
ductility capacities) dissipate the majority of energy through nonlinear hysteresis, as opposed 
to through viscous damping. Hence, these systems are much less sensitive to damping than 
systems designed for limited yielding.

5.3.2 Effects of Medium Stiff and Soft Soils on Load Reduction Factors 
Studies performed by Miranda (1991) have confirmed that load reduction factors are strongly 
dependent upon the ratio of site local period to structure fundamental period. Sites with 
foundation material consisting of rock or firm alluvium tend to have predominant periods 
much higher than most structures. However, sites with foundation material consisting of soft 
soils, such as those in the Mexico City and San Francisco Marine District areas can have very 
low periods which approach those of typical building structures. This site material, if  
affected by passing seismic waves of similar periodicity, can be excited into motion in 
resonant fashion, leading to very severe earthquake demands for structures with periods close 
to that of the site.
To study the effects of site local soil conditions on load reduction factors, the BN, JT11060 
and FT4060 systems were analyzed subjected to two additional families of earthquake time 
histories: a set of 34 records made on firm alluvium, and a set of 22 records made on soft soil 
sites with local periods in the range of 1.0 sec to 2.0 sec. The resulting load reduction factors 
determined for these sites are shown below in Figures 5-62 to 5-67.
The alluvium records produce very similar load reduction factors as those determined using 
rock records. The soft soil records, however, confirm substantial dependence of the load 
reduction factor on the ratio between site and structure period. Allowable load reduction is 
greatest when the structure period is equal to or greater than that of the site. This is due to the 
fact that the yielding structure can escape the resonant period by yielding. Similarly,

allowable load reduction is smallest when the period of the structure is less than the site
period, as yielding will now carry the structure towards the period of resonance.

5.3.3 Results of Study Compared to Current Load Reduction Methods
Bea (1996) has suggested the use of a load reduction factor Fe of the following form for
offshore platforms:
Fe = afi
li is the displacement ductility the system is capable of developing, and a  is the ratio of the 
area of the hysteresis envelope of the actual system to that of an ideal elastic-plastic system. 
This factor is based on the results of a limited study on degrading systems performed using 
the program PC-ANSR in 1993 at U. C. Berkeley. If the system hysteresis is elastic-plastic, 
Fe converges to (l. This reflects the trend noticed by Veletsos and Newmark (1960) and 
others that load reduction is roughly proportional to the allowable displacement ductility for 
SDOF systems with periods greater than 1.0 sec subject to motions recorded on firm soils.
To validate this approach to estimating load reduction, the mean load reduction for the 
various types of degrading systems was listed in Table 5-6 for various periods and 
displacement ductilities (ground motions recorded on rock); the allowable load reduction was 
also estimated through application of the relationship for Fe. Figures 5-68 to 5-71 show 
graphically the effective load reduction for the Table 5-6 systems capable of a ductility of 4 
through the period spectrum for different values of a. Comparing the results, it can be seen 
that the factor Fe provides a reasonably conservative approximation to the allowable load 
reduction for the strength and stiffness degrading (JT) systems for periods greater than 1.0 
sec. For periods less than 1.0 sec, the estimated load reduction is unconservative for several 
of the degrading systems. For long periods (3.0 sec or greater), the simple approximation

estimates load reduction perhaps at most 10% beyond what was determined by the statistical 
study. For systems with just strength degradation (FT), however, the simple approximation 
appears excessively conservative for periods of 1.0 sec and higher, while becoming slightly 
unconservative at periods below 1.0 sec.

Based on the data presented in Tabie 5-6, and taking into account the influence of local soil 
characteristics on effective load reduction, the following adjustments should be made to Fe:
•  For strength- and stiffness-degrading systems in the period range between 0.5 sec and 1.0 
sec, the allowable load reduction estimated by j ia  should vary from an unadjusted value 
at 1.0 sec to a 20% reduction at 0.5 sec. Beyond 1.0 sec, load reduction is bounded by
•  For strength-degrading systems in the period range between 0.5 sec and 1.0 sec, the 
allowable load reduction estimated by f ia  should vary from an unadjusted value at 0.5 sec 
to a value increased by 20% at 1.0 sec. Beyond 1.0 sec, this increase should be 
maintained.
•  In the range from T/TSite equal to 0.5 to 1.0, the load reduction should be scaled from two- 
thirds the normal (firm soil) value to twice the firm soil value. In the range from T/Tsile 
equal to 1.0 to 1.5, the load reduction should be scaled back down from twice the normal 
value to the normal value.
It should be remembered that these calibrated values of empirical load reduction are based on 
mean value results from the statistical studies, with uncertainties in the range of 15% to 50%. 
For design purposes in which this uncertainty is not explicitly considered, it would be prudent 
to use the load reduction associated with the mean minus one standard deviation, or a similar 
correction. Given, however, that the mean can be estimated using the above relationship, and 
the uncertainty is a known range, by assuming either a normal or log-normal distribution, the

appropriate correction can easily be estimated. Statistical distributions for R factors are 
examined in Chapter Seven.
5.4 MDOF COMPARISONS
To evaluate the practicality of using equivalent SDOF systems to represent the behavior of 
MDOF systems with degrading behavior, two studies were performed using MDOF models 
containing elements exhibiting degrading behavior. These analyses were performed using the 
programs DRAIN-2DX and PC-ANSR. The first study focuses on strength degradation at the 
foundation level, while the second study concentrates on strength and stiffness degradation in 
the main portion of the simple structure. In the course of the studies, the number of DOF, the 
fundamental mode mass participation, and the yield strength of each level in the MDOF 
structures were varied, to provide a range of application over which the SDOF 
approximations could be judged.
Comparisons were carried out by first constructing and analyzing an equivalent SDOF of the 
simple MDOF structure in question. Each SDOF was analyzed for a family of six earthquake 
time histories (see Table 5-7); the mean value of the ratios between the scale factors on the 
time histories at system yield and the scale factors at an equivalent local (story) ductility 
demand of four were determined from these analyses. This value, here designated FM, is the 
allowable reduction associated with elastically-determined load the SDOF is entitled to due 
to ductile action. FM is the scale factor applied to the ground motion necessary to cause a 
given level of damage ju in a MDOF structure, once the ground motion has already been
increased to the point of causing incipient yield in the structure. Bazzurro and Cornell (1994)

provide an excellent summary of the philosophy behind Fm and other generalized damage
parameters.
The given MDOF structure was then also analyzed for the same family of time histories, and 
similar ratios were developed, using a local (story) displacement ductility of four as a target. 
The differences in the means of these ratios was then used to judge the effectiveness of the 
SDOF approximation to predicting the response of the MDOF system.

5.4.1 MDOF with Strength-Degrading Foundation
The first structural configuration considered was a two-bay frame (Figure 5-72). The 
program DRAIN-2DX was used to perform the analysis. The bottom column portions of the 
model were DRAIN-2DX “Type 15” elements, with end hinges which, upon yielding, would 
exhibit strength degradation. The story above the foundation level was made of “Type 02” 
elements with strength sufficient to keep them elastic. The structure was pin supported in the 
vertical at each mass in order to restrict response to lateral action only.

Figure 5-72: Two-Bay Frame
The 2-DOF model, with fundamental mode participating mass ranging from 60% to 90%, 
was studied by both the equivalent SDOF approach and MDOF analysis. Participating mass 
was altered by changing the ratio of the top mass to the total mass of the system and the 
stiffnesses of the top. In all cases, the fundamental period of each MDOF structure was kept 
at 1.5 sec.
Table 5-8 shows the mean values of the scale factors associated with the requisite 
displacement ductility demand from the time history analyses, along with mean values of the 
local story (foundation lateral) ductility demands. The comparisons between the equivalent 
SDOF and the 2-DOF system show that the SDOF approximation is quite reasonable for this 
system; mean results from the SDOF are within 15% of those found from MDOF analysis for 
this system. As the first mode dominance is relaxed, however, variability in the scale factor

needed to cause the requisite local ductility demand increases. Also, as first mode dominance 
is relaxed, the significance of degradation in the foundation level appears to be reduced.

strength and stiffness configurations were chosen: one in which strength and stiffness were 
uniform, and one in which the bottom frame possessed one-half the strength and stiffness of  
the top frame or frames. The structure was pin supported in the vertical at each mass in order 
to restrict response to lateral action only.
The three models, with fundamental mode participating mass ranging from 60% to 90%, 
were studied by both the equivalent SDOF approach and MDOF analysis. Participating mass 
was altered by changing the ratio of the top mass to the total mass of the system. In all cases, 
the fundamental period of each MDOF structure was kept at 1.5 sec.
Tables 5-9 and 5-10 show the mean values of the scale factors associated with the requisite 
displacement ductility demand from the time history analyses, along with mean values of the 
local story (foundation lateral) ductility demands. For both systems, the scale factor needed 
to cause the requisite ductility demand is seen to decrease with increasing DOF; the scale 
factor appears to increase with decreasing fundamental mode mass participation. Variability 
in response appears to increase with decreasing fundamental mode mass participation.
Overall, the SDOF approximation appears to be insensitive to the presence of weak stories in 
the structure. This is likely due to the fact that the damage pattern is established by static 
pushover analysis, which will capture the presence of strength and stiffness discontinuities. 
This might also be due to the fact that the individual stories have poor post-yield behavior, 
leading to damage concentration following yielding. Nevertheless, the SDOF approximation 
works well at emulating the displacements the MDOF structure is likely to be subject too.

5.5 CONCLUSIONS
To develop a set of load reduction and displacement modification factors for platform 
systems, a statistical study was performed using SDOF systems with hysteretic behaviors 
characteristic of two typical platform yield mechanisms: (1) yielding in the jacket, and (2)

yielding in the foundation. Mean values of these factors, and their associated uncertainties, 
were determined for a range of hysteretic parameters. These factors will aid in both the 
preliminary design of new platforms for earthquakes, as well as the assessment of existing 
structures.
The statistical study also evaluated the effects of damping and of local soil conditions on the 
load reduction factors. Increases in damping were found to be of limited benefit for systems 
which develop displacement ductilities greater than two, and for periods greater than 1.0 sec. 
Ground motions recorded on firm alluvium resulted in load reduction factors similar to those 
generated using ground motions recorded on rock. Ground motions recorded on soft soils 
showed a strong dependence upon the ratio of the structure period to the natural period of the 
site.
A series of MDOF structures with degrading element behavior were analyzed both as MDOF 
systems and equivalent SDOF systems, with the intent of qualitatively assessing the utility of 
the equivalent SDOF approach with degrading systems. It was found that the equivalent 
SDOF approach provided estimates of damage to the MDOF structures which were very 
comparable to results obtained through the use of MDOF models, providing the structure is 
first-mode dominated. First mode dominance in this case was indicated by a fundamental 
mode participating mass of 70% to 80%. It should be noted, however, that this is an 
extremely limited study of MDOF systems; additional application of the SDOF approach to 
predicting MDOF structural behavior is explored in Chapter Six for more complex structures.

CHAPTER SIX:
CASE STUDIES INVOLVING APPLICATION OF SIM PLIFIED METHODS
6.0 INTRODUCTION
Elements of a simplified method for assessing a platform’s ability to survive earthquakes
have been documented in Chapters Three, Four and Five. Chapter Three has dealt with (1)
approximate methods useful for estimating platform modal properties which, together with a
response spectrum, can be used to determine earthquake loads on a platform, and (2)
approximate methods for estimating the ductility demands imposed on platform components
during a strong earthquake. Chapter Four has documented methods by which (1) the strength
and displacement ductility of primary platform structural components (deck bay, jacket bays,
foundation lateral and overturning) can be determined, and (2) how these component
strengths and ductilities can be related to an effective platform global strength and ductility.
Finally, Chapter Five has documented the determination of (1) a set of load reduction factors
R used to scale down elastic response spectrum forces, and (2) a set of displacement
modification factors FA used to correlate elastic and inelastic peak displacements from
earthquake excitation. Both factors are based on the hysteretic behavior and displacement
ductility of the platform; the R factors can be used to assess the ultimate displacement
ductility capacity of the platform in terms of forces (yield force and response spectrum load,
both indexed on base shear), while the FA factors can allow the ultimate displacement
ductility capacity to be assessed in terms of displacements (yield displacement and response
spectrum displacement, both indexed on deck displacement). Displacement ductility
assessments made using these factors assume the platform is first-mode dominated.

The complete method is applied to the assessment of five jacket-type platforms in this 
chapter, with the objective of benchmarking the method’s accuracy and limitations. To 
accomplish the benchmarking, the following comparisons are made:
• Modal properties from the simplified procedures of Chapter Three against modal 
properties from 3-D modal analysis using detailed (full frame) models.
• Strength-level demand-capacity analysis, using modal response spectrum forces from the 
simplified (Chapter Three) model and component strengths from Chapter Four, against 
using 3-D modal response spectrum analysis and element strengths based on state-of-the- 
art procedures.
• Global displacement ductility capacity, using the procedures of Chapter Four against 
conventional static pushover analysis with a 3-D full frame model.
• Ductility-level demand-capacity analysis, using (1) response factor-modified strength- 
level analysis results, with response factors selected on the basis of the global 
displacement ductility capacity analyses, and (2) nonlinear 2-D and 3-D time history 
analysis with a full frame model.
Comparison of the modal properties is straight-forward. The strength-level comparisons are 
expressed in terms of response spectrum ZPA, i.e. the scale factor which is applied to all 
response spectrum forces (and hence demands) in order to generate a load which exceeds an 
element or component strength. Global displacement ductility capacity is judged in terms of 
both the effective global strength (Sa associated with the fundamental lateral mode used to 
scale the load pattern to yield, or the base shear from first mode forces) and the global
250

displacement ductility, as determined from deck displacement, the platform exhibits prior to 
exceeding the ductile capacity o f gravity supports or a pre-defined global residual strength 
limit. Ductility-level comparisons are performed in two ways: (1) by judging the effective 
load reduction R implied by the displacement ductility analyses against scale factors Fu 
determined from the MDOF time history analyses, and (2) by judging the displacement 
modification FA implied by the displacement ductility analysis against the ratio of the deck 
displacement found from the MDOF time history analysis to the MDOF first mode elastic 
response spectrum displacement for the same time history. In addition, the mean value of Sa 
(associated with the dominant mode) which results in yielding is determined and compared to 
the value of Sa used to scale the force pattern to yield in the global ductility analysis; this 
provides a check on the significance of higher modes in reaching yield.
These case studies represent the first effort to evaluate the simplified ductility-level 
assessment procedures documented in Chapters Three and Four and the response factors in 
Chapter Five against what constitutes “state-of-the art” analysis of real platform structures. 
Previous work performed by Stear and Bea (1998) and Perez, et al. (1998) has resulted in the 
preliminary verification of the simplified modal response spectrum analysis procedures 
documented in Chapters Three and Four. The study conducted by Perez, et al. (1998) is 
significant in that it represents the first application of the simplified methods to screening a 
large group of platforms; in this study the simplified methods were applied to the ultimate- 
strength assessment of twenty platforms in the Gulf of Mexico — Campeche Bay area. A 
summary of this study with information supplied by PEMEX/IMP(1999) is contained in the 
last section of this chapter.

6.1 CASE STUDY #1: PLATFORM A
Platform A is a hypothetical design for a symmetric 4-leg production platform (see Figure 6- 
1). The structure is designed for 100 ft water depth. The deck is at +50 ft MWL and 
supports a load of 5,000 kips. The main diagonals in the first jacket bay are 24 inch-diameter 
(w.t. 0.5 inch), while those in the second bay are 30 inch-diameter (w.t. 0.625 inch); the 
diagonals in the deck bay are 36 inch-diameter (w.t. 0.75 inch). The joints into which the 
braces are framed are heavy-wall joint cans. The legs are 78 inch-diameter (w.t. 0.875 to
1.125 inches); the annulus between each leg and associated pile is grouted. The piles are 72 
inch-diameter (w.t. 1 to 1.5 inches), and are designed for 150 ft penetration in medium to stiff 
clay. The shear strength of the clay is 2.5 kips/ft2 at the surface, and increases by 0.01 kip/ft2 
per ft of depth. The pile ends are founded on a very stiff soil layer (rock) which has a shear 
strength of 184 kips/ft2. All steel in the jacket is 36 ksi, while the pile steel is 50 ksi.

This platform, commonly known as the Southern California Example Structure, was used as 
a case study in the development of early nonlinear time history analysis software for the 
offshore industry. Results of several such case studies have been documented in two papers 
(Gates, et al., 1977; Marshall, et al., 1977); results from these studies are used to assist in 
developing models for the benchmarking of the simplified screening methods.
6.1.1 Modal Analysis
Platform A was analyzed using the simplified modal procedure, and the results were 
compared to results from a 3-D frame modal analysis for the platform. Both analyses 
considered the effect of added mass on the platform. In the 3-D model, braces were modeled 
using stmt elements, while the legs and piles were modeled using beam-column elements. 
The deck was assumed to act as a rigid diaphragm. A set of nonlinear springs was used to 
represent pile-head stiffnesses at the mudline in the 3-D model; these springs were developed 
from the analysis of a model of a single pile (beam-column elements supported by nonlinear 
spring elements). For the sake of consistency, the axial and lateral pile-head stiffnesses used 
in the 3-D model were also used in the simplified model. Table 6-1 lists the lateral and axial 
pile-head stiffnesses, as well as the approximate stiffnesses they correspond to.

Figure 6-2 shows the lateral mode shapes and vibration periods of the platform as estimated 
by the simplified modal procedure, while Figure 6-3 shows these same quantities as derived 
from the 3-D model (torsional vibration has been neglected in the simplified model, and 
hence is not reported for the 3-D model). The differences between the results are very small; 
hence the simplified modal method is observed to provide excellent estimates of modal 
properties for Platform A relative to a 3-D frame model.

6.1.2 Strength-Level Demand-Capacity Analysis
Modal forces were estimated for both models using the API (1993) Soil B response spectrum 
together with the appropriate modal properties. For both models, forces were assumed to act 
on all three axis simultaneously, with a proportion of 1.0/0.66/0.5 used to scale the primary 
lateral (in principal direction of excitation), secondary lateral (perpendicular to principal 
direction of excitation), and vertical components of load. The SRSS combination rule was 
used in combining modal responses.
A comparison of the effective story shears and axial forces induced on the piles are shown in 
Table 6-2 and Figure 6-4 for a spectrum ZPA of 0.25 g. The shears shown in the figure are 
those associated with the primary lateral mode for all levels above the mudline; the mudline

shear is found from a SRSS combination of the two lateral components. The shears are 
shown in this fashion because the braced portions of the structure will typically only resist 
load in-plane with the braced frames, while the lateral load on the foundation will be resisted 
by all piles regardless of load direction. Given the similarity in modal properties, the 
estimated response spectrum shears and overturning forces are also quite close.

observed in tests. A l.Og local load was used to envelope the local brace vibration load 
contribution. Brace buckling capacities used by Marshall, et al. (1977) are shown in Table 6- 
3, along with brace buckling capacities estimated through application of limit equilibrium 
principles assuming a buckling length equal to the full length of the X-brace, and a buckling 
length equal to Vz the length of the brace. An effective length factor of k = 0.5 was used to 
derived the buckling capacity for both of the limit equilibrium estimates. It was assumed 
tubular joints would not govern the capacity of the braces; this assumption is based on the 
fact that the joints have heavy wall cans, and all joints (including the X-joints in the X- 
braces) are manufactured from higher grade material. Table 6-4 shows the ultimate strengths 
of the imbedded piles as found from analysis of the model of the single pile as well as 
estimates made using the limit equilibrium approach.

The estimates made using the full unbraced length of the X-brace compare fairly well to 
those derived by Marshall, et al. (1977) during the earlier investigation of the platform, 
differing by at most 3%. As mentioned previously, however, testing of X-braces performed

by Zayas, et al. (1980) and others has indicated that these braces will tend to buckle across Vz 
the overall length of the brace, as the center cross-point acts as a support; hence, the strengths 
estimated using Vz the overall length are more likely to be representative of the true brace 
axial capacities. Relative to the strengths estimated by Marshall, et al. (1977), the X-braces 
could have capacities on the order of 35% higher.
The pile ultimate capacities compare very well, differing by at most 10%. The soil 
characteristics were deliberately chosen by Marshall, et al. (1977) to be very strong, so as to 
emphasize nonlinear behavior in the jacket of the platform.
Using the simplified loads and capacities, the earthquake “intensity” (expressed in terms of 
the response spectrum ZPA) resulting in the formation of a collapse mechanism is 0.55 g; the 
weak link is the first jacket bay braces. Gross shear demand for this level of load and the 
associated platform shear capacity profile are shown in Figure 6-5. Also shown on this graph 
is the demand-capacity profile of the platform without the approximate jacket-Ieg/pile 
bending contribution to bay strength; it is apparent that the legs, which are unusually massive 
for platforms of this type, develop noticeable resistance when the braces reached their 
buckling limits, as the intensity necessary to form a mechanism in this case is 0.43 g. The 3- 
D analysis indicates the earthquake intensity resulting in the formation of a collapse 
mechanism is 0.56 g; the elements which will fail first are the first jacket bay braces. The 
simplified method provides results that are in excellent agreement with those from the 3-D 
analysis.

Platform A was also used as a test case for benchmarking the equipment-structure interaction 
procedure described in Chapter Four used for determining the local load due to brace lateral 
acceleration. To qualitatively assess the significance of local acceleration load, the axial 
capacities of braces in Platform A were determined for three cases: (1) ignoring local lateral 
loads, (2) including local lateral loads calculated by the simplified method of Chapter Four, 
and (3) including local loads originally used in the platform design.
The characteristics of bracing members in the platform are shown below in Table 6-5. As 
this platform has heavy-wall joint cans, it was assumed that the end conditions of the braces 
could be considered fixed. The periods of the braces are very low compared to those of the 
structure, thus indicating that response will approach the limiting condition of very stiff

equipment. For the purpose of this comparison, X-braces were considered supported at the 
center of the X; thus brace vibration properties and axial capacities are determined using a 
length equal to 50% of the entire brace length.

For the local load determined through application of the equipment-structure interaction 
method, acceleration contributions were determined based on excitation of both the two 
principal horizontal directions and the vertical direction, using the API (1993) Soil-B 
spectrum with a PGA of 0.5 g. The spectrum accelerations for the different directions were 
calculated assuming a ratio of 1.0 (horizontal in-plane with member) :0.66 (horizontal 
perpendicular to member):0.5 (vertical) between the different spectrum scale factors. For the 
sake of simplicity, the local acceleration components were all assumed to be perpendicular to 
the axis of the brace irrespective of the structure mode associated with the acceleration 
component. Acceleration components appropriate to each mode, along with the modal 
participation factors, are shown in Table 6-6.

Horizontal accelerations are dominated by the first two horizontal modes, while the vertical 
accelerations are quite large in the fundamental mode. Local acceleration components 
determined by the equipment-structure interaction method for the different braces are shown 
in Table 6-7, along with the axial capacities associated with the three conditions.

The structure acceleration corresponding to the top of each bay was used to determine the 
response of braces within a bay. From the results in Table 6-7, the 1.0 g local acceleration 
originally used to envelope the brace accelerations at the design stage is slighdy conservative 
for braces in the deck bay and first jacket bay, but matches the acceleration in the lower bay. 
However, it is apparent that the lateral load from local member response has a negligible 
effect on tubular brace capacity for this platform. Accounting for local acceleration changes 
the brace buckling capacities by at most 4%; the effect on overall platform capacity will be of 
similar (small) magnitude.
6.1.3 Global Ductility Analysis
The simplified methods of Chapter Four were used to assess the global displacement ductility
of Platform A. As the structure is symmetric, and a previous analysis performed by Gates, et
al. (1977) indicated the foundation did not control post-yield behavior, a 2-D analysis was
performed. The global load-displacement behavior estimated by application of the simplified
methods was compared to results from a static pushover analysis performed using PC-ANSR.
261

The PC-ANSR model was developed using member and soil characteristics specified by 
Gates, et al. (1977).
Platform A was analyzed using two different horizontal bracing schemes: weak braces (18 
inch diameter, and 0.375 inch w.t.), and strong braces, with twice the wall thickness as the 
weak braces. Using both configurations allowed for an evaluation of both the concentrated 
damage and the distributed damage assumptions of the simplified ductility approach.
Using first mode forces as a load pattern, the simplified method indicates the platform has an 
effective lateral load yield strength of 3,900 kips; the strength is governed by buckling of the 
braces in the first jacket bay. This value of base shear corresponds to an API Soil B response 
spectrum ZPA of 0.60 g (Sa for the fundamental lateral mode equal to 0.47 g). The base 
shear including all lateral modes is 4,200 kips, indicating the potential error induced by 
indexing on base shear is small. Using PC-ANSR, the platform’s lateral load yield strength 
is estimated to be 3,930 kips; this analysis confirms the first jacket bays braces are the first 
members to yield. The two strength estimates are in excellent agreement.
Figure 6-6 depicts the global load displacement behavior estimated by both the simplified 
method and PC-ANSR for the “weak” horizontal configuration. Using the simplified 
method, the horizontal braces are judged incapable of supporting the tension capacity of the 
braces in the bays around them; thus the jacket configuration is classed as “weak,” and 
damage is assumed to concentrate in the first bay in which braces buckle. Strength drops 
quickly to the point at which braces in the first jacket bay reach their cyclic ductility limits,
262

and continues to degrade at a lesser rate beyond that point. The global load-displacement 
curve generated by PC-ANSR is similar in trend, but highlights the approximate nature of the 
simplified approach. The PC-ANSR analysis reveals that the braces in the first bay do buckle 
first; this is followed by the buckling of braces in the bottom bay, and then the buckling of 
the horizontals between these two bays. After the horizontals buckle, supportable lateral load 
begins to drop rapidly. A portal mechanism begins to form as displacement increases. While 
the simplified method captures the general trend in load-displacement behavior, the specifics 
of which members are buckling and yielding are not represented. The simplified method will 
not capture the propagation of damage into the second jacket bay due to the bending of the 
jacket legs.
Using the 70% residual strength criteria documented in Chapter Four, Platform A would 
possess very limited ductility. Using this criteria to establish global displacement limits, the 
simplified analysis indicates Platform A should be limited to a global displacement ductility 
of 1.3. Using the same criteria, the PC-ANSR analysis also indicates global displacement 
ductility should be limited to 1.3.
Figure 6-7 depicts the global load displacement behavior estimated by both the simplified 
method and PC-ANSR for the “strong” horizontal configuration. Using the simplified 
method, the horizontal braces are judged capable of supporting the tension capacity of the 
braces in the bays around them; thus the jacket configuration is classed as “strong,” and 
damage is assumed to concentrate in the jacket, but distributed between bays. Strength drops 
gradually to the point at which braces in the first jacket bay reach their cyclic ductility limits,

and then degrades more rapidly as damage in assumed to concentrate in the first jacket bay 
following the exceeding of the braces’ local buckling limits.

The global load-displacement curve generated by PC-ANSR is very similar in trend. The 
PC-ANSR analysis indicates the braces in the first bay buckle first, followed by the buckling 
of braces in the bottom bay. Damage then begins to concentrate in these two bays. At a deck 
displacement of 38 inches, the horizontals between the first and second jacket bays buckle; 
supportable load begins to drop, and a portal mechanism begins to form in the legs. Again, 
while the simplified method captures the general trend in load-displacement behavior, the 
specifics of which members are buckling and yielding are not represented.

Using the 70% residual strength criteria, the simplified analysis indicates Platform A is 
capable of developing a global displacement ductility of 2.7. The PC-ANSR analysis 
indicates a global displacement ductility capacity of 2.9. It should be noted, however, that at 
these limits, severe damage will have occurred to the diagonal braces in both bays; PC-ANSR 
indicates braces in the first and second jacket bays will have been subjected to local ductility 
demands in excess of 12 at this level of deck displacement.

6.1.4 Ductility-Level Demand-Capacity Analysis
Ductility-level comparisons were performed in two ways for Platform A: (1) by judging the 
effective load reduction R implied by the simplified displacement ductility analyses against 
scale factors F determined from MDOF nonlinear time history analyses, and (2) by judging 
the displacement modification F , implied by the simplified displacement ductility analyses

against the ratio of the deck displacement found from the MDOF nonlinear time history 
analysis to the MDOF first mode component of displacement (assuming linear elastic 
behavior) for the same time history. Also, the mean fundamental lateral mode spectral 
acceleration Sa (assuming 5% damping) which represented the onset of nonlinear behavior in 
the platform was determined, to compare with the value determined in the global ductility 
analysis; this comparison checks the validity of indexing on first mode response to 
characterize platform strength capacity.
Load reduction and displacement modification factors were selected from Chapter Five. As 
noted earlier, factors are selected based on three parameters:
• The fundamental lateral period of the structure.
• The global displacement ductility capacity.
• The expected degradation mode associated with cycling to the global displacement 
ductility capacity limit.
For the weak configuration, use was made of Figures 5-35 and 5-37 for estimating R, and 5- 
36 and 5-38 for estimating FA; the data in these figures bounds the behavior exhibited by the 
platform in this structural configuration. At a period of 1.5 sec, and for small inelastic 
displacements, the load reduction is roughly proportional to the ductile capacity of the 
system. Hence, R is taken to be 1.3. Similarly, FA will be very close to unity for overload 
ratios of 4.0 or less.
266
Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.
For the strong configuration, R was estimated using Figure 5-27, and Figure 5-28 was used 
for Fj. R will be close to 3.0, while FA will be in the range of 1.0 to 1.2 providing the 
overload ratio is 4.0 or less.
The PC-ANSR models used in Section 6.1.3 were utilized to determine FM, the effective load 
reduction a nonlinear MDOF system is entitled to based on ductile action, and to evaluate the 
relationship between inelastic and equivalent elastic (first mode) deck displacements. 
Rayleigh damping was assumed, with mass and stiffness-proportional coefficients balanced 
such that 5% critical damping was achieved in the first two lateral modes. In lieu of 
rigorously calculating damping coefficients for structure and soil elements, stiffness- 
proportional damping was first assigned to steel elements in the platform, such that its 
fundamental lateral mode damping was increased to 1.5%. Mass-proportional and stiffness- 
proportional (soil only) damping was then balanced for the entire soil-structure system until 
5% damping was achieved in the first two lateral modes. Each model was analyzed using a 
series of nine earthquakes (see Table 6-8); two damage measures, brace local ductility (using 
the cyclic limit as a target) and global displacement ductility (using the allowable as 
determined from the ductility analyses), were used as criteria for F .̂
The mean values of F' for each damage measure, and the ratio of inelastic to elastic deck 
displacement, are shown in Table 6-9 for both structural configurations. The target global 
damage for the weak configuration was (1=1.3, while for the strong configuration the target

was [1=2.7. The target local damage was [1=5.0 for any brace. The inelastic to elastic deck 
displacement ratio was averaged for overloads of two and three.

The mean value of Sa.yieid, representing the level (as measured by first lateral mode spectral

mode effects do not greatly affect the onset of yielding in the platform. The R factors 
selected based on the results of the global ductility analyses compare very well with the F' 
factors derived using global displacement ductility capacities as targets. Using the static

pushover PC-ANSR results from Section 6.1.4, the weak configuration platform develops 
local ductility demands of five on tubular braces in the first jacket bay at a global 
displacement ductility of 1.5, while the strong configuration platform develops local ductility 
demands of five on tubular braces in the first jacket bay at a global displacement ductility of 
1.6; assuming load reduction is directly proportional to global displacement ductility in this 
range, it is seen that these values match well with the Fu values found using local ductility 
demand as a criteria. Similarly, for the levels of overload considered, the elastic and inelastic 
displacements are approximately equal.
6.1.5 Platform A: Summary of Results
Platform vibration properties estimated using the simplified method compare very well with 
those calculated by analyzing a full-frame model of the platform. Using the API Soil B 
response spectrum as a basis for loads, the simplified demand-capacity provides an excellent 
estimate of platform capacity, as expressed by response spectrum ZPA, as compared to 
results from use of the full-frame model. The simplified ductility analysis captures the 
approximate global displacement limit of the platform, and the general hysteretic envelope is 
similar to that estimated by static pushover analysis for two configurations of horizontal 
framing: weak and strong. However, it must be noted that the envelope curve estimated by 
the simplified method is very approximate, being a  semi-empirical representation of the 
pushover behavior of the platform; member local demands will not be well-represented at 
large levels of global displacement.

MDOF response factors and elastic-to-inelastic deck displacement ratios derived from 
nonlinear time history analysis compare very well with factors and ratios selected based on 
the results of the global displacement ductility analyses. This indicates that the results of the 
static pushover analyses, modified by factors derived from the analysis of SDOF systems 
with hysteresis characteristics similar to those exhibited by the complete platform system, 
provide a good representation of the “effective” dynamic capacity of the platform. The 
factors link the static pushover analysis results to true dynamic behavior by implicitly 
accounting for the effects of time-varying structural yielding.
6.2 CASE STUDY #2: PLATFORM B
Platform B is an 8-leg drilling platform sited in 265 ft of water in San Pedro Bay off Southern 
California (see Figure 6-8). It was designed to support 80 24 inch-diameter conductors. The 
platform has two decks located at +45 ft MWL and +64 ft MWL respectively; the deck bay is 
braced. The jacket is battered 1:7 in the broadside direction, and 1:12 in the end-on direction. 
The main diagonals range from 20 inch-diameter (w.t. 0.75 inch) to 36 inch-diameter (w.t.
1.125 inches). The comer legs of the jacket are 71 inch-diameter (w.t. 1 to 2 inches), while 
the interior legs are 54 inch-diameter (w.t. 0.675 to 2 inches); the legs have heavy joint cans 
but are not grouted. The comer piles of the platform are 66 inch-diameter, and penetrate to 
264 ft. The center piles are 48 inch-diameter, and penetrate to 232 ft. The soil at the site is 
predominantly clay (medium-stiff to stiff). The majority of the structural members are 36 ksi 
steel, while the piles are 50 ksi steel.

This platform was used as a case study in evaluating analysis methods used for the design of 
jacket-type platforms in earthquake-prone areas. Results of this case study were documented 
as part of an API-sponsored research project, API PRAC 26 (PMB, 1980 and 1981), and are 
used to assist in developing models for benchmarking the simplified approach.

Platform B was analyzed using the simplified modal procedure, and the results were 
compared to results from a 3-D frame analysis of the platform. In the 3-D model, braces 
were modeled using stmt elements, while the legs and piles were modeled using beam- 
column elements. The lower deck were modeled simply with linear beams approximating the

major deck trusses; rigid stubs were extended to the elevation of the upper deck to allow for 
masses to be input at that level. Piles were modeled to a depth of 100 ft below the mudline, 
using beam-column elements supported by nonlinear springs. The axial behavior of the pile 
below 100 ft was approximated by use of a nonlinear truss element. Conductors were 
modeled by an equivalent single element at each jacket level, and modeled as a series of 
beam elements below the mudline supported by nonlinear springs. The conductors were left 
free to slip in the vertical direction.
Pile-head springs were derived for the simplified model by developing models of single piles 
based on P-Y and T-Z soil spring information contained in the PRAC report, and then 
analyzing these models using DRAIN-3DX for a series of unit loads. Linearized pile-head 
springs derived by this approach are shown below in Table 6-10, along with the approximate 
stiffness these springs correspond to.

model, and hence is not reported for the 3-D model).

Comparing the results, it is seen that the simplified analysis underestimates the fundamental 
periods of vibration, with the differences on the order of 9% to 17%. The difference is due to 
the fact that the jacket is more prone to “warping” in shear due to ungrouted condition of the 
legs. The additional flexibility is not captured by the simplified method. For comparison 
purposes, both models were changed to reflect grouting; in this case the fundamental 
horizontal periods for end-on response were 2.24 sec (3-D) and 2.3 sec (simplified), while the 
fundamental periods for broadside response were 2.1 sec (3-D) and 2.2 sec (simplified). 
While the periods of higher modes are seen to drift apart as higher response modes are 
considered, and there are some slight differences in mode shape, the simplified analysis 
provides good estimates of vibration properties relative to those of the detailed analysis.

6.2.2 Strength-Level Demand-Capacity Analysis
Modal forces were estimated for both models using the API (1993) Soil C response spectrum 
together with the appropriate modal properties. The SRSS combination rule was used in 
combining modal responses. Comparisons of the effective story shears and axial forces 
induced on the piles are shown in Table 6-11 and Figures 6-13 and 6-14 for a ZPA = 0.25 g. 
The shears shown in the figures are those associated with the directional response for all 
levels above the mudline; the mudline shear is found from a SRSS combination of the two 
lateral components, with the component perpendicular to the frame in question reduced by 
33%. The estimated response spectrum shears are quite close, with those from the simplified 
model being slightly overestimated (by at most 15%) relative to those found from the 3-D 
analysis.

For demand-capacity assessment purposes, forces were assumed to act on all three axes 
simultaneously, with a proportion of 1.0/0.66/0.5 used to scale the primary lateral (in 
principal direction of excitation), secondary lateral (perpendicular to principal direction of 
excitation), and vertical components of load. Brace and pile capacities were estimated using 
the simplified procedures in Chapter Four; a local load associated with an acceleration of 
0.625 g was used in determining brace axial capacities. Tubular joint capacities were not 
considered; the platform has heavy wall joint cans which are capable of supporting the full 
tension capacities of attached braces.
Using the simplified loads and capacities, the limiting load case was found to be that in 
which the major axis of excitation was end-on. For this load case, an earthquake intensity of

0.34 g results in the yielding of a comer pile in compression. To show the relative strengths 
of the different platform components at this level of load, end-on and broadside demand- 
capacity curves are shown in Figures 6-15 and 6-16. Examining the demand-capacity curves, 
it appears likely that the next elements to yield would be braces in the first or third jacket 
bays in the end-on frames.
Strengths for elements in the 3-D model were taken from PMB (1980, 1981) and from 
relationships documented by Marshall, et al. (1977). The 3-D analysis also indicates the load 
case in which the major axis of excitation is end-on governs capacity; a comer pile will be the 
first structural member to fail. Using the same loading strategy as for the simplified analysis, 
this damage occurs for loads corresponding to a spectrum ZPA of 0.38 g. The simplified 
analysis results are in very good agreement with the results from the 3-D frame analysis, with 
a difference in earthquake damage intensity of 10%.
The damage trends identified by the response spectrum analyses are in qualitative agreement 
with results from time history analyses documented by PMB (1981). These analyses 
indicated the platform would, for the case of principal excitation on the end-on axis, undergo 
yielding in the foundation, and suffer some minor damage to diagonal braces in the jacket.
Platform B was also used as a test case for benchmarking the equipment-structure interaction 
procedure described in Chapter Four used for determining the local load due to brace lateral 
acceleration. To qualitatively assess the significance of local acceleration load, the axial 
capacities of braces in Platform B were determined for three cases; (1) ignoring local lateral

The characteristics of bracing members in the platform are shown below in Tables 6-12 and 
6-13. As this platform has heavy-wall joint cans, end conditions of the braces were assumed 
to be fixed. The periods of the braces are for the most part very low compared to those of the 
structure, thus indicating that response will approach the limiting condition of very stiff 
equipment. However, several braces in the lower jacket bays (broadside frames) have periods 
close to the periods of several of the higher structure modes, which will result in some 
amplification.
Brace buckling capacities were determined for the bracing members in Tables 6-12 and 6-13 
for three cases of local load: (1) zero local load, (2) local load determined using the 
equipment-structure interaction method, and (3) a local load associated with a 0.625 g 
acceleration perpendicular to the axis of the brace. The constant 0.625 g acceleration 
envelope was estimated by determining response spectra for the floor of each jacket bay 
associated with three earthquake time histories, and then taking the peak spectral acceleration 
value (out of all the spectra) associated with the period range covering brace lateral periods. 
In this case, the peak value was chosen for a brace period of 0.5 seconds, which was deemed 
a conservative assumption (this placed the brace vibration period close to several of the 
significant vibration periods of the platform).
For the local load determined through application of the equipment-structure interaction 
method, acceleration contributions were determined based on excitation of both the two 
principal horizontal directions and the vertical direction, using the API (1993) Soil-B 
spectrum with a PGA of 0.25 g. The spectrum accelerations for the different directions were

calculated assuming a ratio of 1.0 (horizontal in-plane with member):0.66 (horizontal 
perpendicular to member):0.5 (vertical) between the different spectrum scale factors. For the 
sake of simplicity, the local acceleration components were all assumed to be perpendicular to 
the axis of the brace irrespective of the structure mode associated with the acceleration 
component. Acceleration components appropriate to each mode, along with the modal 
participation factors, are shown in Table 6-14. Horizontal accelerations are dominated by the 
first two horizontal modes, while the vertical accelerations are quite large in the fundamental 
mode.

Local acceleration components determined by the equipment-structure interaction method for 
the different braces are shown in Tables 6-15 and 6-16, along with the axial capacities 
associated with the three conditions. The structure acceleration corresponding to the top of 
each bay was used to determine the response of braces within a bay.
The 0.625 g local acceleration which was originally used to envelope the brace accelerations 
at the design stage is conservative relative to the specific values calculated explicitly 
considering brace-structure interaction for all braces in the platform. Local load based on the 
constant acceleration results in axial capacity reductions of up to 15%; using the local 
accelerations specific to each brace results in capacity reductions on the order of up to 7%. 
This difference is more significant than for Platform A; for structures with long, flexible 
braces, it will likely be advantageous from an assessment standpoint to expend the additional 
effort to better estimate the local load on the braces.

6.2.3 Global Ductility Analysis
The simplified methods in Chapter Four for predicting ductility capacity were intended to be 
applied on the major axes of a platform; however, for instances in which off-axis response 
governs capacity (likely for weak foundations and unbraced deck bays), it is possible to 
approximate the post-yield response by considering the yielding component to behave as a 
rigid section whose displacements or rotations under the individual components of principal 
axis response are combined for the total displacement or rotation demand.
283

The ductility analyses considered excitation acting concurrently on all three axes of the 
platform, with vertical excitation acting downwards. Loads patterns for each direction were 
based on fundamental mode forces for each principal direction; the scaling between load 
patterns was 1.0 end-on/0.66 broadside/0.5 vertical. The global load-displacement behavior 
determined in the simplified analysis was compared to results from a static pushover analysis 
performed using DRAIN-3DX. While DRAIN-3DX does not have a Marshall-type strut 
element, indications from both the PMB (1980, 1981) reports and the modal analyses were 
that yielding in the foundation would govern capacity. Hence, the error of using bilinear 
strain-hardening stmts for modeling tubular braces was accepted.
The simplified analysis indicated the first member in the platform to yield would be a comer 
pile (by failure in the supporting soil); this event occurred at a total resultant (from end-on 
and broadside directions) base shear of 12,100 kips. This base shear corresponds to the 
fundamental end-on and broadside load components being scaled with an API Soil C 
spectrum ZPA of 0.38 g (Sa for the fundamental end-on period is 0.29 g). This is 11% higher 
than the ZPA estimated including higher modes, indicating modes beyond the fundamental 
modes on each axis do not contribute significantly to initial yielding. Using DRAJN-3DX, 
the resultant base shear at yield was 13,250 kips; Sa for the fundamental end-on period in this 
case is 0.32 g.
Figures 6-17 and 6-18 depict the individual principal axis displacements and base shear 
components for Platform B for both the simplified analysis and the DRAIN-3D analysis. The 
simple model is slighdy stiffer than the 3-D model, hence overall displacement magnitude is

less. Displacement beyond the yielding of the comer pile was estimated by assuming the 
foundation would continue to rotate as a rigid base, gradually forming a plastic mechanism. 
Loading continued until a second pile yielded completely; at this point, the resultant base 
shear had increased to 18,150 kips, and the platform had developed a global displacement 
ductility (as measured by resultant deck displacement at pile yield to resultant deck 
displacement at second pile yield) of 1.52. At this point, the load is high enough to cause 
buckling of end-on braces in the first jacket bay.
For the 3-D model, near-field soils begin yielding at a resultant base shear of 6,670 kips. Soil 
yielding continues until the comer pile forms a plastic mechanism, at which point gross 
nonlinearity becomes evident in the global hysteresis plots. If the point of comer pile 
yielding is taken as a reference, the 3-D model indicates Platform B is able to develop a 
global displacement ductility of 1.45 at the point of the yielding of a second pile, and the 
buckling of end-on braces in one frame in the first, second, and third jacket bays. As the 
model did not have Marshall-type stmts, loading was halted after the braces developed local 
ductility demands of two.
While the general trend of yielding in the platform identified by the simple method for this 
load pattern is similar to that identified by the static pushover analysis, the estimated strength 
predicted by the simplified method at the point of second pile yielding is higher, and the 
change in stiffness following yielding is less pronounced. These differences are due to the 
assumption that the foundation rotates as a rigid section, as opposed to sections of it 
becoming more flexible as yielding occurs. More importantly, the global ductility analyses of
285

Platform B highlights some of the general difficulties in using static methods to assess 
potential earthquake damage in large, complicated structures which do not exhibit sudden 
yielding. The gradual yielding of soil, while not greatly affecting the hysteresis curve, 
indicates there will be increases in effective damping due to local soil plasticity. The 
magnitude of this effect cannot easily be judged from the static pushover results. Also, the 
indicated yield level and post-yield behavior are quite sensitive to the magnitude of the load 
components used in the analyses. If the end-on and broadside load components were 
considered to be similar in amplitude and phase, the yield capacity .of the platform would be 
smaller. Similarly, if the end-on and broadside components are considered to be significantly 
out-of-phase, the yield capacity will be larger; damage to the steel portions of the structure 
will occur sooner for these single-axis loads. When performing an assessment of this type, 
care must be taken to choose a load pattern which will capture the most severe failure modes. 
While a given direction might be strong relative to others, it could have poorer post-yield 
characteristics.

6.2.4 Ductility-Level Demand-Capacity Analysis
Ductility-level comparisons were performed in two ways for Platform B: (1) by judging the 
effective load reduction R implied by the simplified displacement ductility analyses against 
scale factors FM determined from MDOF nonlinear time history analyses, and (2) by judging 
the displacement modification F, implied by the simplified displacement ductility analyses 
against the ratio of the deck displacement found from the MDOF nonlinear time history 
analysis to the MDOF first mode component of displacement (assuming linear elastic 
behavior) for the same time history. Also, the mean fundamental lateral mode spectral 
acceleration Sa (assuming 5% damping) which represented the onset of nonlinear behavior in 
the platform was determined from the time history analyses, to compare with the value 
determined in the global ductility analysis; this comparison checks the validity of indexing on 
first mode response to characterize platform strength capacity.
The DRAJN-3DX model used in Section 6.2.3 was utilized to determine Fu, the effective load 
reduction a nonlinear MDOF system is entitled to based on ductile action, and to evaluate the 
relationship between inelastic and equivalent elastic (first mode) deck displacements. 
Rayleigh damping was assumed, with mass and stiffness-proportional coefficients balanced 
such that 5% critical damping was achieved in the first two fundamental lateral modes. 
DRAIN-3DX does not have spring elements capable of modeling strength degradation in 
near-field soils; therefore soil behavior was modeled as elastic-plastic. However, this 
platform is founded on fairly competent soils (stiff clays), where little degradation would be 
expected.

The model was analyzed using a series of nine earthquakes (see Table 6-8); the major 
component of motion was used on the end-on axis. Three damage measures, were used as 
criteria for F :̂ brace local ductility (using one half the cyclic ductility limit from Chapter 
Four as a target), global deck displacement (using the peak X displacement from the static 
pushover analysis as targets), and pile axial ductility (using a limit of two as a target). The 
ratio of inelastic to elastic displacement was averaged for an overload (using Sa-yieid from the 
static pushover analysis as a reference point) of two. The mean values of for each damage 
measure, and the ratio of inelastic to elastic deck displacement, are shown in Table 6-17.

While the reference yield end-on deck displacement used with the dynamic analyses was 
taken to be identical to the end-on deck displacement at the point of significant nonlinearly in 
the DRAIN-3DX static pushover analysis (which corresponded to the full yielding of soil 
supporting a comer pile), the dynamic analyses did not typically show full pile yielding at this 
point. Instead, pile yielding and brace buckling in the jacket were initiated at slightly higher 
levels of excitation. This difference is the result of two factors: the gradual yielding in the 
soils around the piles, which effectively increases damping in the platform, the fact that the 
Y-component o f excitation is not always in phase with the X-component at a significant 
amplitude.
289

The brace buckling in the jacket was largely confined to the end-on frames, and was 
distributed between all four jacket bays. The buckling was predicted by the static pushover 
analyses to occur after the first complete yielding of a comer pile; however, the dynamic 
analyses indicated it was more likely to occur at the same level of excitation.
From the results of the global ductility analyses in Section 6.2.3, it would be reasonable to, at 
a minimum, classify the platform as bilinear non-degrading in that mode of deformation. 
Referring to Figures 5-3 and 5-59, SDOF non-degrading systems with 5% and 10% critical 
damping, it is reasonable to expect an effective load reduction on the order of 1.5. This value 
is in reasonable (conservative) agreement with that calculated from the dynamic analyses of 
Platform B using global end-on deck displacement as a measure. The local displacement 
ductility criteria for braces was achieved at a level of deck displacement close to 33 inches in 
nearly all cases; hence, it is not surprising that these two measures indicate consistent levels 
of equivalent elastic load. Using global deck displacement as a criteria, the platform will 
reach this displacement at a level of end-on fundamental mode spectral excitation 
corresponding to 1.68 x 0.33 g = 0.55 g. Using brace local displacement ductility as a 
criteria, this level is 1.42 x 0.38 g = 0.54 g. Using local axial ductility limit of two results in 
a smaller allowable level of excitation (0.51 g); however, it was been assumed the piles are 
capable of achieving higher local axial ductility than this for the purpose of the analysis. As 
noted in Chapter Four, pile axial ductility limits are very difficult to quantify, and will likely 
depend upon stability and the occurrence of local damage to elements forced into the 
foundation soil.

The ratio of inelastic to elastic displacements is seen to be less than one, whereas through 
referencing Figure 5-4, this ratio would be expected to be unity or slightly higher. The 
discrepancy is due to the gradual yielding of soil along the piles, which increases effective 
damping. As noted in Chapter Five and by others, damping is most helpful when 
displacement ductility demands are low, which is the situation here.
6.2.5 Platform B: Summary of Results
The simplified method used for estimating platform vibration properties compares reasonably 
well with those calculated by analyzing a full-frame model of the platform; period estimates 
were within 17% of those found using the frame model. Differences were attributed to the 
lack of accounting for the overall flexibility of a large, ungrouted jacket; the jacket is able to 
warp due to the lower leg stiffness.
Using the API Soil C response spectrum as a basis for loads, the simplified demand-capacity 
assessment provides a capacity estimate which is fairly close to that estimated from the 3-D 
analysis; a similar failure mode is identified using a similar load set.
The global displacement ductility analysis highlights the limitations of both applying a 
simplified method to a structure which has gradual yielding and multi-axis response, and to 
the application of equivalent static methods in general. While similar levels of global 
displacement ductility were predicted for various events along the hysteresis path, the

simplified method substantially overestimated the reserve strength of the platform. 
Foundations on large platforms will not likely remain plane after loading commences.
While it has been stated in previous chapters that the presumed ductile behavior is sensitive 
to the load pattern, this is quite evident in the results of sections 6.2.3 and 6.2.4. The initial 
failure mode was assumed to be pile yielding; however, the dynamic analyses indicated pile 
yielding and brace buckling would likely occur at similar load levels. Soil yielding, while not 
significantly changing the stiffness of the platform system, will result in noticeable energy 
dissipation. This effect is not represented in the SDOF systems studied earlier, which exhibit 
a sudden change in stiffness when yielding begins; this can be compensated for by using a 
response factor with higher initial damping. Differences due to gradual yielding are likely to 
be significant at low levels of global ductility, when the platform system is still developing 
some reserve strength.
6.3 CASE STUDY #3: PLATFORM C
Platform C is a 12-leg production platform sited in 257 ft of water in San Pedro Bay off 
Southern California (see Figure 6-19). The platform has two decks located at +45 ft MWL 
and +71 ft MWL respectively; the deck bay is braced. The jacket is battered 1:10 in the 
broadside direction, and 1:14 in the end-on direction. The main diagonals range from 24 
inch-diameter (w.t. 0.625 inch) to 36 inch-diameter (w.t. 0.75 inches). The exterior legs of 
the jacket are 53 to 54 inch-diameter (w.t. 0.75 to 1 inch), while the two interior legs are 47 
inch-diameter (w.t. 0.675 to 1 inch); the legs have heavy joint cans but are not grouted. The 
exterior piles of the platform are 48 inch-diameter; the comers penetrate to 252 ft, while the

remainder penetrate to 221 ft. The interior piles are 42 inch-diameter, and penetrate to 200 ft. 
The soil profile at the site is the same as for Platform B (Section 6.2). The majority o f the 
structural members are 36 ksi steel, while the piles are 42 ksi steel.
6.3.1 Modal Analysis
Platform C was analyzed using the simplified modal procedure, and the results were 
compared to those obtained from a modal analysis conducted using the DRAIN-3 D model. 
In the 3-D model, braces were modeled using simple strut elements, while the legs and 
columns were modeled using beam-column elements. The decks were modeled with beam 
elements approximating the stiffness of the deck trusses. Piles were modeled using a set of 
equivalent nonlinear springs representing pile-head behavior derived from models of single 
piles. P-Y and T-Z soil spring information contained in the PRAC report on Platform B 
(PMB, 1980) was used to develop appropriate springs for the pile analysis (Platform B and 
Platform C are located close to one another). Linear equivalents to these pile-head springs 
were used in the simplified analysis (Section 6.2, Table 6-10).
Figures 6-20 and 6-22 show the lateral mode shapes and vibrations periods of the platform 
derived from application of the simplified method, while Figures 6-21 and 6-23 show these 
same quantities as derived from the 3-D model; again, torsion has been neglected for the 
simplified model and hence is not reported for the 3-D model.

the fundamental modes. The variation, while slightly less pronounced than that for Platform 
B, is attributed to the size of the jacket and the lack of grout.

6.3.2 Strength-Level Demand-Capacitv Analysis
Modal forces were estimated for both models using the API (1993) Soil C response spectrum 
together with the appropriate modal properties. The SRSS modal combination rule was used 
in combining modal responses. A comparison of the effective story shears and axial forces 
induced in the piles are shown in Table 6-18 and Figures 6-24 and 6-25 for a response 
spectrum ZPA = 0.25 g. The shears shown in the figures are those associated with the 
primary lateral load for all levels above the mudline; the mudline shear is found from an 
SRSS combination of the two lateral components, with the component perpendicular to the 
frame in question reduced by 33%. The estimated response spectrum shears and pile loads 
are quite close, with those from the simplified model being slightly overestimated (by at most 
9%) relative to those from the 3-D analysis.

Demand-capacity analysis was conducted using the simplified methods for both major 
horizontal axes of the platform. Forces were assumed to act on all three axes simultaneously, 
with a proportion of 1.0/0.66/0.5 used to scale the primary lateral, secondary lateral, and 
vertical components. Diagonal brace capacities were determined both including and 
excluding local acceleration loads of 0.625 g. As this platform has canned joints capable of 
developing the full tension capacities of attached braces, joint capacities are not shown.

The simplified method identifies pile yielding/hinging as governing the strength of the 
platform, however, the axial capacity of the pile (based on the soils) is also close to being 
exceeded. As the simplified approach approximates the interaction between pile bending and 
axial stress components (axial load is assumed to be shed to the soil very quickly, and hence 
not affect the formation of the second hinge), the ductility each mechanism can develop 
should be evaluated. When the major axis of excitation is end-on, an earthquake intensity of 
0.27 g provides the loads necessary to initiate the foundation lateral failure mechanism; a 
fully-plastic mechanism based on pile hinging will form at an intensity of 0.34 g. Behavior 
for major excitation on the broadside axis is very similar, due to similarities in load 
magnitude between the two directions. End-On and broadside demand-capacity curves are 
shown in Figures 6-26 and 6-27 for loads generated by a ZPA of 0.34 g. The gross deck and 
jacket bay shear capacities are seen to be moderately affected by the local acceleration load 
on braces; the presence of this load can change the strength of the most likely member to fail 
by as much as 20%, leading to similar changes in platform shear capacity. From these 
curves, the next elements to yield would likely be the braces in the second and third jacket 
bays of the end-on frames.
Strengths for elements in the 3-D model were determined using information from PMB 
(1980, 1981) and from relationships documented by Marshall, et al. (1977). The 3-D analysis 
also indicates the load case in which the major axis of excitation is end-on governs capacity; 
the failure mode in this analysis was lateral failure of a comer pile, although the pile axial 
capacity was also close to being exceeded (resultant loads are close to the gross pile axial and 
lateral capacities). Using the same loading strategy as the simplified method, this will occur

at an earthquake intensity of 0.30 g. The simplified analysis under-predicts the capacity of 
the platform by approximately 11%; this difference can be traced to two factors: the over­
prediction of the base shear by the simplified modal analysis method, and a slightly 
conservative estimate of pile lateral strength from the simplified method as compared to the 
pile lateral strength estimated from the single pile analysis. Both analyses identify the 
foundation (either lateral or overturning) as the weak link in the platform system.

The similarity in behavior between Platform C and Platform B is not surprising; both 
platforms are of similar build and strength. Platform C has a weaker lateral foundation 
strength due to the absence of the conductors supported by Platform B.
6.3.3 Global Ductility Analysis
A simplified ductility analysis was performed for Platform C, and the results of this analysis 
were compared to results from a static pushover analysis performed using DRAIN-3 DX. The 
limitations of DRAIN-3DX have been previously noted in Section 6.2.2; however, given the 
robust character of the foundation soils, and the fact that braces would not be the most critical 
mechanism, these limitations were accepted.
301

Load patterns for each direction in the analyses considered excitation acting concurrently on 
all three axes of the platform, with vertical excitation acting downwards. Load patterns for 
each direction were based on fundamental mode forces for each principal direction; the 
scaling used was 1.0 end-on/0.66 broadside/0.5 vertical.
Figures 6-28 and 6-29 show the principal axis deck displacements and associated base shears 
for Platform C for both the simplified analysis and the DRAIN-3DX analysis. The simplified 
analysis indicated yielding in the foundation piles (laterally) begins at a total resultant base 
shear of 12,300 kips. A fully-plastic mechanism will form at a total resultant base shear of 
15,370 kips. This base shear corresponds to the end-on and broadside load components being 
scaled with an API Soil C spectrum ZPA of 0.30 g and 0.37 g respectively (Sa for the 
fundamental end-on period at these events is 0.25 g and 0.32 g). These values are 8% higher 
than the ZPA estimated including higher modes, and, as for Platform B, indicates modes 
beyond the fundamental modes on each axis do not contribute significantly to initial yielding. 
The hysteretic behavior of Platform B was estimated by assuming the pile will begin to yield 
at approximately 50% of its lateral strength capacity (as expressed by the load needed to form 
a two-hinge mechanism); at this point, its stiffness is assumed to reduce to 30% of its initial 
value. While all of the piles will not actually yield at the same point, the simplified method 
conservatively assumes all piles (of the same diameter and penetration) yield laterally as one 
group. While the plots in Figures 6-28 and 6-29 show a sudden change in stiffness, below 
the effective yield strength of the platform, in reality the behavior between these two points 
will be curvilinear, with slope decreasing as the load increases towards the mechanism 
strength. The formation of a complete double hinge mechanism in the piles is taken as the
302

limited point of global displacement ductility; the platform is able to develop a global 
displacement ductility of approximately 2.7, using the approximate point of pile yielding as a 
reference. Braces in the second and third jacket bays will likely buckle as this point is 
approached.
Using the 3-D model with DRAIN-3DX, near-field soils begin yielding at a resultant base 
shear of 6,200 kips. The global load-displacement behavior gradually becomes increasingly 
nonlinear, as more soil springs yield and the piles also begin to yield. Pile yielding occurs at 
a resultant base shear of 13,410 kips (Sa for the fundamental end-on period is 0.26 g); a fully- 
plastic mechanism has formed when the load reaches 17,430 kips (Sa for the fundamental 
end-on period is 0.34 g). Behavior becomes complicated at this point is approached; one pile 
begins to plunge, and braces in the second and third jacket bays of the end-on frames begin to 
buckle. Using pile hinge ductility as a measure, the platform is able to develop a global 
displacement ductility of 2.5 when complete double hinges have formed in the legs; at this 
point, brace local ductility demands are no greater than 2.5.
The results of the simple and detailed analyses are generally in good agreement. The post­
yield reduction in pile stiffness used in the approximate plotting process appears to range 
from 50% to 25%, based on a cursory review of the load-displacement curves found when 
generating the equivalent linear stiffnesses used in the modal analyses of platforms A, B and 
C. While not exact, the approach provides an adequate method of estimating the load- 
displacement curves of piles in material with variable shear strength.

6.3.4 Ductility-Level Demand-Capacity Analysis
Ductility-level comparisons were performed in two ways for Platform C: (1) by judging the 
effective load reduction R implied by the simplified displacement ductility analyses against 
scale factors Fu determined from MDOF nonlinear time history analyses, and (2) by judging 
the displacement modification FA implied by the simplified displacement ductility analyses 
against the ratio of the deck displacement found from the MDOF nonlinear time history 
analysis to the MDOF first mode component of displacement (assuming linear elastic 
behavior) for the same time history. Also, the mean fundamental lateral mode spectral 
acceleration Sa (assuming 5% damping) which represented the onset of nonlinear behavior in 
the platform was determined from the time history analyses, to compare with the value 
determined in the global ductility analysis; this comparison checks the validity of indexing on 
first mode response to characterize platform strength capacity.
The DRAJN-3DX model used in Section 6.3.3 was utilized to determine F , the effective load 
reduction a nonlinear MDOF system is entitled to based on ductile action, and to evaluate the 
relationship between inelastic and equivalent elastic (first mode) deck displacements. 
Rayleigh damping was assumed, with mass and stiffness-proportional coefficients balanced 
such that 5% critical damping was achieved in the first two fundamental lateral modes. As 
noted previously, DRAIN-3DX does not have spring elements capable of modeling strength 
degradation in near-field soils; therefore soil behavior was modeled as elastic-plastic. 
However, this platform is founded on fairly competent soils (stiff clays), where little 
degradation would be expected.
305

The model was analyzed using a series of nine earthquakes (see Table 6-8); the major 
component of motion was used on the end-on axis. Three damage measures, were used as 
criteria for Fu: brace local ductility (using one half the cyclic ductility limit from Chapter 
Four as a target), global deck displacement (using the peak X displacement from the static 
pushover analysis as targets), and pile hinge ductility (using a limit of 2.5 as a target). The 
ratio of inelastic to elastic displacement was averaged for an overload (using Sa-yieid from the 
static pushover analysis as a reference point) of two. The mean values of Fm for each damage 
measure, and the ratio of inelastic to elastic deck displacement, are shown in Table 6-19.

The results in Table 6-19 are very similar in trend to those obtained for Platform B, which is 
not unexpected. While the reference yield end-on deck displacement used with the dynamic 
analyses was taken to be identical to the end-on deck displacement at the point of significant 
nonlinearly in the DRAIN-3DX static pushover analysis (which corresponded to the full 
yielding of soil supporting a comer pile), the dynamic analyses did not induce pile yielding 
until excitation had been increased approximately 20%. The observed difference is the result 
of (1) the gradual yielding in the soils around the piles, which effectively increases damping 
in the platform, and (2) the Y-component of excitation not always being in phase with the X- 
component at a significant amplitude.
306

The brace buckling in the jacket was largely confined to the end-on frames, and was 
distributed between the first, second and third jacket bays. Buckling tended to occur after the 
point at which one or more plastic hinges had formed in the tops of piles; this is to be 
contrasted with the static pushover analyses, in which buckling did not occur until several 
piles had already formed double hinges.
The three damage measures used in the dynamic analyses are consistent with one another. 
The platform will reaches the prescribed global displacement limit at a level of end-on 
fundamental mode spectral excitation corresponding to 3.10 x 0.30 g = 0.93 g; diagonal 
braces, which tended to have buckled prior to this level of displacement, on average reached 
local ductility demands of 2.5 at an excitation of 1.40 x 0.60 g = 0.84 g. Similarly, the first 
instance of pile hinge formation tended to occur before braces buckled, at an excitation of 
1.60 x 0.36 g = 0.58 g. Using the first occurrence of large plastic hinge rotations is the most 
restrictive limit in this example. While it is indeed likely that the platform could survive up 
to the formation of many plastic hinges in the piles, it is better from a safety standpoint to 
keep the ductility demands on gravity load-supporting members small.
From the results of the global ductility analyses in Section 6.3.3, it is reasonable to classify 
the platform as bilinear non-degrading in the mode of deformation studied. Referring to 
Figures 5-3 and 5-59, SDOF non-degrading systems with 5% and 10% critical damping, it is 
reasonable to expect an effective load reduction on the order of 2.75 to 3.0, associated with 
the formation of hinges in all of the piles. This effective load reduction is in good agreement
307

with that calculated from the dynamic analyses of Platform C using global end-on deck 
displacement as a measure. The local displacement ductility criteria for braces was achieved 
at a level of deck displacement close to 33 inches in nearly all cases; hence, it is not 
surprising that these two measures indicate consistent levels of equivalent elastic load. 
However, it would be prudent from a safety standpoint to select a load reduction factor 
associated with pile hinge ductility, in order to err on the side of conservatism.
The ratio of inelastic to elastic displacements is seen to be less than one, whereas through 
referencing Figure 5-4, this ratio would be expected to be unity or slightly higher. This 
situation was also noted in the analysis of Platform B. The discrepancy is due to the gradual 
yielding of soil along the piles, which increases effective damping. As noted in Chapter Five 
and by others, damping is most helpful when displacement ductility demands are low, which 
is the situation here for an overload ratio of two.
6.3.5 Platform C: Summary of Results
The simplified method used for estimating platform vibration properties compares very well 
with those calculated by analyzing a full-frame model of the platform; period estimates were 
within 11% of those found using the frame model. Using the API Soil C response spectrum 
as a basis for loads, the simplified demand-capacity assessment provides a capacity estimate 
which is very close to that estimated from the 3-D analysis; the correct principal failure mode 
is also identified.
Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.
The simplified ductility analysis compares well with results from a static pushover analysis; 
the global displacement ductility estimated for the point of pile hinging in the foundation 
varied at most by 6% between the two methods. The simplified method provided a generally 
conservative estimate of platform yield and reserve strength for the load pattern considered.
The dynamic analysis results of Platform C bring forth the same issues as the analysis of 
Platform B: sensitivity to load pattern, and the effects of minor yielding prior to gross 
nonlinearity in the structure. These can be addressed in the static case by using load 
reduction factors with higher initial damping, and by considering a variety of load patterns 
when performing the initial static pushover analyses.
6.4 CASE STUDY #4: PLATFORM D
Platform D is a 12-leg drilling and production platform sited in 58 ft of water off Huntington 
Beach in Southern California (Figure 6-30). The platform supports 42 20 inch-diameter 
conductors, 12 of which are guided at the mudline and can be expected to provide lateral 
resistance. The platform has two decks located at +34 ft and +58 ft respectively. There is 
minimal diagonal bracing between the decks and between the decks and the jacket. The main 
diagonals in the jacket range from 12 inch-diameter (w.t. 0.33 inch) to 14 inch-diameter (w.t. 
0.375 inch). The jacket legs are 33 inch-diameter; the jacket legs possess 18 ft extensions 
which penetrate into the foundation soil. The annulus between each leg and associated pile is 
grouted. The piles are 30 inch-diameter (w.t. 0.875 to 1.5 inches), and penetrate between 60 
to 80 ft through layers of silt, clay and sand. All steel is assumed to be 36 ksi, with 10%

This platform was the subject of an extensive requalification effort in the early 1990’s. 
Based on the results of storm and earthquake assessments, the platform was upgraded to 
ensure its continued serviceability for an additional 20 years. The upgrades included grouting 
the leg-pile annulus, drilling out and grouting the piles below the mudline, adding saddles to 
strengthen the K-joints in the chevron braces in the broadside frames, and repair of minor 
cracks. In addition, marine growth and non-essential equipment was removed from the 
structure. The results of several of these analyses were made available by the California State 
Lands Commission (CSLC, 1998), and are used to assist in developing models for 
benchmarking the simplified approach.

6.4.1 Modal Analysis
Platform D was analyzed using the simplified modal procedure, and the results have been 
compared to those obtained using a 3-D frame model. In the 3-D model, diagonal braces and 
horizontal braces in the end-on frames were modeled using strut elements, while horizontal 
braces in the broadside frames, legs and piles were modeled using beam-column elements. 
Piles below the mudline were modeled by beam-column elements supported by nonlinear 
springs. The 12 conductors which are framed at the mudline were modeled as a single 
equivalent element. Masses on the 3-D model were moved onto the principal axes of the 
platform, to eliminate lateral-torsional coupling.
Pile-head springs were derived for the simplified model by analyzing the behavior of a single 
pile using DRAIN-3 DX. Linearized pile-head springs derived by this approach are shown in 
Table 6-20.

Figures 6-31 and 6-33 show the lateral mode shapes and vibration periods of the platform as 
estimated by the simplified method, while Figures 6-32 and 6-34 show these same quantities 
as derived from the 3-D model.Comparing the results, it is seen that the simplified analysis 
provides results which are in excellent agreement with those obtained from the full-frame 
model. Given the short, stocky configuration of this platform, this result is not unexpected.

6.4.2 Strength-Level Demand-Capacity Analysis
Modal forces were estimated for both models using the API (1993) Soil A response spectrum 
together with the appropriate modal properties. The SRSS combination rule was used in 
combining modal responses. Comparisons of the effective story shears and axial forces 
induced on the piles are shown in Table 6-21 and Figures 6-35 and 6-36 for a ZPA = 0.25 g. 
There is excellent agreement in shear demands between the two models; given the similarity 
in predicted response components, this is not an unexpected result. There is a 10% difference 
between peak pile loads; this is due to the approximate way in which pile loads are assumed 
to be shared (i.e. equally) by the simplified method. The piles were not placed in tension.

For demand-capacity assessment purposes, forces were assumed to act on all three axes 
simultaneously, with both components of lateral load at 100% and the vertical component at 
50%. Pile capacities and brace capacities for diagonals in the end-on frames were estimated 
using the s im plified procedures of Chapter Four; a local load associated with an acceleration 
of 0.75 g was used in determining brace axial capacities. As this platform has grout in the 
leg-pile annulus, tubular joints at the legs were considered able to develop the full capacities 
of attached braces. However, it was decided to consider the joints at the apex of the chevron 
braces to be in an unmodified state; hence, the joint capacity, and not brace capacity, 
governed the strength of these composite elements. Joint capacities were derived from the 
API relationships listed in Chapter Four, and were used in lieu of the buckling and tension 
capacities of the broadside braces.

Using the simplified load and capacities, the broadside frames were found to govern platform 
strength for the load pattern considered. For this load case, an earthquake intensity of 0.38 g 
results in the yielding of joints in the chevron braces of the third jacket bay broadside frames. 
To show the relative strengths of members at this level of load, end-on and broadside 
demand-capacity curves are shown in Figures 6-37 and 6-38. Base shear in both cases in the 
SRSS combination of the individual base shear- components from both principal axes. 
Examining the curves, it appears braces in the first and second jacket bays of the broadside 
frames and first jacket bay of the end-on frames are also weak links.

Strengths for the elements in the 3-D model were derived from single pile analysis and from 
relationships documented by Marshall, et al. (1977). API relationships were used to derive 
effective axial capacities for the braces in the chevron frames as with the simplified model. 
The 3-D analysis also indicates the broadside braces in the bottom jacket bay are the weak 
link. Using the same load strategy as for the simplified analysis, this damage will occur for 
loads corresponding to a spectrum ZPA of 0.39 g. This is practically identical to the value 
estimated by the simplified method. The damage trends identified by these response 
spectrum analyses are in qualitative agreement with results from analyses made available by 
CSLC (1998).

6.4.3 Global Ductility Analysis
A simplified ductility analysis was performed for Platform D, and the results of this analysis 
were compared to results from a static pushover analysis performed using PC-ANSR. The 
problem of joints being the weak link in the broadside frames posed a problem for PC- 
ANSR, which does not have a composite joint-type element. Instead, the same approach 
which was utilized in the original assessment analyses was applied here to emulate the 
behavior of the joint-brace system: if the joint capacity was less than 50% of the brace 
capacity, an elastic-plastic stmt element with the joint axial capacity was used to model the 
brace; otherwise, a buckling-type stmt was used, with the strength of the stmt was matched to 
the joint capacity, and the post-buckling behavior scaled accordingly. The horizontal 
members in the chevron frames were modeled as beam-column elements, as PC-ANSR does 
not have a buckling-type beam-column element; as the horizontal braces are strong relative to 
the braces with reduced capacity, this is a reasonable assumption.
Load patterns for the two principal directions were based on first mode forces; vertical 
excitation forces were applied acting downwards. Figures 6-39, 6-40 and 6-41 show the 
principal axis displacements and base shears for Platform D for both the simplified analysis 
and the PC-ANSR analysis. Two analyses were performed for the end-on direction; as the 
framing in the platform is not symmetric, it is expected that the strength and post-yield 
behavior for each direction of load will be different.
These analyses indicate that the second mode on each principal horizontal axis contributes 
significantly to the base shear; and hence for the spectrum used will play a role in effective
318

platform capacity. Both analyses for the broadside frames indicate the bottom jacket bay 
chevron braces are the weak links; the base shear at the yield point approximately 2,800 kips. 
This base shear corresponds to a spectrum ZPA of 0.56 g (Sa for the fundamental broadside 
period is 0.46 g). However, the strength-level analyses indicated the broadside braces would 
likely reach capacity with all modes considered for a spectrum ZPA of 0.38 g, i.e. 33% lower 
in intensity. To account for this multi-mode effect in a conservative fashion, the effective 
fundamental mode spectral acceleration at yield should also be scaled back by 33%, or to 
0.30 g. Note that this is an approximation, as the true phase between the modes is of course 
unknown. This has been manifested earlier in the analyses of platforms B and C, which had 
capacities governed by off-axis modal components.

The analyses for the end-on frames indicate the platform capacity is in the range of 2,500 kips 
(simplified) to 2,800 kips (PC-ANSR). This base shear corresponds to a spectrum ZPA of 
0.53 g (Sa for the fundamental end-on period is 0.42 g). This is again higher than that needed 
to cause yielding in the chevron braces in the bottom of the broadside frames; hence, it 
appears the broadside frames will likely govern capacity of the platform.
For all directions of loading, the horizontal braces are capable of transferring the load of 
buckling main diagonals. Using the simplified method for the broadside direction, damage is 
assumed to concentrate in the jacket. Strength drops until the braces in the bottom jacket bay 
reach their cyclic ductility limits; at that point, displacement is assumed to concentrate in the 
bottom jacket bay. Using the 70% residual strength criteria as a cut-off, the platform is able 
to develop a global displacement ductility of 1.5. Using the simplified method for both end- 
on directions, damage is again assumed to concentrate in the jacket; strength drops until the 
braces in the first jacket bay reach their cyclic ductility limits, at which point displacement is 
assumed to concentrate in the top jacket bay. Using the 70% residual strength criteria as a 
cut-off, the platform is able to develop a global displacement ductility in the range of 1.5 to 
2.0 .
The global load-displacement curves generated by PC-ANSR contain a “plastic zone” of 
varying length, followed by a drop in strength. For the broadside frames, the braces in the 
bottom jacket bay buckle first, followed by braces in the second jacket bay. Strength begins 
to degrade, and hinges begin to form in the legs at a global displacement ductility of 1.9. For 
the end-on frames in the direction which places the most braces in compression, strength

plateaus briefly, and then begins to degrade. Hinges begin to form in the legs at a global 
displacement ductility of 1.7. Behavior is similar in the opposite direction, although the yield 
plateau is somewhat better; hinges form in the legs at a global displacement ductility of 
approximately 2.1.
The post-yield behavior estimated by the simplified method does not provide an indication of 
the “plastic zones” identified by the PC-ANSR analyses for either direction. However, the 
simplified method does provide a reasonable empirical estimate of global displacement 
ductility. The values estimated by the simplified method are on the order of 5% to 20% 
conservative relative to those derived from the PC-ANSR analyses. The amount of 
degradation predicted is fairly conservative; this will result in a selection o f smaller response 
factors. It is once again emphasized that the simplified method cannot rigorously predict the 
true behavior of which members are yielding and buckling within the jacket following first 
member failure. The method is only intended to provide an estimate of the likely global 
behavior of the jacket, making assumptions about the redundancy and post-buckling 
performance of members in the structure.
6.4.4 Ductilitv-Level Demand-Capacity Analysis
Ductility-level comparisons were performed in two ways for Platform D: (1) by judging the 
effective load reduction R implied by the simplified displacement ductility analyses against 
scale factors Fu determined from MDOF nonlinear time history analyses, and (2) by judging 
the displacement modification FA implied by the simplified displacement ductility analyses
against the ratio of the deck displacement found from the MDOF nonlinear time history

analysis to the MDOF first mode component of displacement (assuming linear elastic 
behavior) for the same time history. Also, the mean fundamental lateral mode spectral 
acceleration Sa (assuming 5% damping) which represented the onset of nonlinear behavior in 
the platform was determined, to compare with the value determined in the global ductility 
analysis; this comparison checks the validity of indexing on first mode response to 
characterize platform strength capacity.
The PC-ANSR model used in Section 6.4.3 was utilized to determine FM, the effective load 
reduction a nonlinear MDOF system is entitled to based on ductile action, and to evaluate the 
relationship between inelastic and equivalent elastic (first mode) deck displacements. 
Rayleigh damping was assumed, with mass and stiffness-proportional coefficients balanced 
such that 5% critical damping was achieved in the first two fundamental lateral modes.
The model was analyzed using a series of nine earthquakes (see Table 6-8). By conducting a 
series of analyses, the major component of motion was alternately placed on the principal 
axes of the platform, to ensure both frames would be subject to the most severe component of 
motion. Three damage measures were used: brace local ductility (using the cyclic limit as a 
target) global displacement ductility (using the allowable as determined from the ductility 
analyses), and leg-pile hinge ductility (using a limit of two as a target) were used as criteria 
for Fu. The ratio of inelastic to elastic displacement was averaged for an overload of two, 
using a spectral acceleration of 0.30 g as a reference. The mean values of Fu for each damage 
measure, and the ratio of inelastic to elastic deck displacement, are shown in Tables 6-22 and 
6-23.

The results obtained from the PC-ANSR analyses indicate there is a moderate contribution 
from higher modes to the response o f the platform. In many cases, damage was recorded at 
lower levels of excitation that would have been assumed from the static analyses. In some 
instances, damage was initiated on braces in one set of frames, but then the damage target 
was reached by braces in the other. However, the mean initiating spectral acceleration value 
for damage to braces is still 25% higher than the “biased” value of Sa (0.3 g) proposed in 
Section 6.4.3.
From the results of the global ductility analyses in the previous section, it is reasonable to 
classify the platform, for both end-on and broadside frames, as moderately degrading. 
Referring to Figures 5-35 and 5-39, the effective load reduction, assuming the platform can 
develop a ductility of 1.7 to 2.0, would be in the range of 1.6 to 1.9. Given the target ductility 
for the MDOF analyses was effectively 2.0, and FM was found to be slightly higher than 2.0
324

for both directions, it can be seen that the values estimated from the static analyses are in 
good agreement with those from the MDOF dynamic analyses. Similarly, referring to Figures
5-37 and 5-39, the ratio of inelastic to elastic displacement is expected to be in the range of 
1.0 to 1.2. These results are also in good agreement with those obtained from the MDOF 
analyses.
Overall, the factors generated using the MDOF analyses are in good agreement with those 
found from the static analyses; however, the issue of multi-mode effects indicates some 
caution is required when applying static methods. In this instance, the average impact of 
modal contributions beyond the fundamental modes was not as severe as anticipated; 
however, it did reduce the assumed platform yield strength by approximately 17% relative to 
the lowest value of Sa estimated from the static analyses. In addition, the variability 
(although sample size is small) is somewhat higher than that observed in previous analyses. 
The multi-mode effect on Sa will likely be dependent upon earthquake magnitude and 
distance; for a close earthquake, where frequency components are arriving at a site at the 
same time, there is a higher probability of different components being in phase. In lieu of 
considering this problem rigorously, one solution would be to analyze the platform statically 
using load patterns other than first mode forces, and then averaging the intensity levels 
indicating damage.

those calculated by analyzing a full-frame model of the platform. Using the API Soil A

response spectrum as a basis for loads, the simplified demand-capacity provides an excellent 
estimate of platform capacity, as expressed by response spectrum ZPA, as compared to 
results from use of the full-frame model.
The global ductility analyses indicated that higher mode effects could be significant for this 
platform; the difference in effective yield spectral intensities was on the order of 33% for 
considering and not considering higher modes. The simplified ductility analysis captures the 
approximate global displacement limit of the platform, and the general hysteretic envelope is 
similar to that estimated by static pushover analysis for two configurations of horizontal 
framing However, it must be noted that the envelope curve estimated by the simplified 
method is very approximate, being a semi-empirical representation of the pushover behavior 
of the platform; member local demands are not well-represented at large levels of global 
displacement.
MDOF response factors and elastic-to-inelastic deck displacement ratios derived from 
nonlinear time history analysis compare very well with factors and ratios selected based on 
the results of the global displacement ductility analyses; however, the effective yield strength 
of the platform was in between the two values estimated during the global ductility analyses. 
This case points out the difficulties of applying the simplified approach when higher modes 
are an issue.

6.5 CASE STUDY #5: PLATFORM E
Platform E is a 12-leg drilling and production platform sited in 187 ft of water off 
Summerland, California (Figure 6-42). The platform supports 56 20 inch-diameter 
conductors; 36 are vertical while the remaining 20 are slanted. The platform has two decks 
located at +43 ft and +70 ft respectively.

piles are 40 inch-diameter (w.t. 1.0 inch), and penetrate approximately 180 ft through a thin 
layer of silty sand into hard claystone. All steel is assumed to be 36 ksi, with a 10% increase 
taken to correct from minimum to average yield strength, and an additional 10% increase 
taken for strain rate effects.
This platform was also the subject of an extensive requalification effort in the early 1990’s. 
Based on the results of storm and earthquake assessments, the platform was upgraded to 
ensure its continued serviceability for an additional 20 years. The upgrade effort focussed on 
strengthening the deck bays, which were found to possess insufficient lateral resistance for 
up-to-date loading conditions. The results o f several of the analyses of the platform in the 
pre-upgraded condition were made available by Unocal (Unocal, 1991), and are used to 
benchmark the simplified approach.
6.5.1 Modal Analysis
Platform E was analyzed using the simplified modal procedure, and the results were 
compared to results from a 3-D frame analysis of the platform. In the 3-D model, braces 
were modeled using stmt elements, while the legs and piles were modeled using beam- 
column elements. Piles below the mudline were modeled by beam-column elements 
supported by nonlinear springs. The 36 vertical conductors were modeled as a single 
equivalent element, while the slanted conductors were excluded from the structural model. 
The upper and lower deck frames were modeled as rigid. Masses on the 3-D model were 
moved onto the principal axes of the platform, in order to minimize lateral-torsional 
coupling.

Pile-head springs were derived for trie simplified model by analyzing the behavior of a single 
pile using DRAIN-3DX. Linearized pile-head springs derived by this approach are shown in 
Table 6-24.

Figures 6-43 and 6-45 show the lateral mode shapes and vibration periods of the platform as 
estimated by the simplified method, while Figures 6-44 and 6-45 show these same quantities 
as derived from the 3-D model. Comparing the results, it is seen that the simplified analysis 
provides results which are in good agreement with those obtained from the fiill-frame model. 
Modal periods differ by at most 6%; there are minor variations in the mode shapes but the 
overall trends are very similar.
6.5.2 Strength-Level Demand-Capacity Analysis
Modal forces were estimated for both models using the API (1993) Soil A response spectrum 
together with the appropriate modal properties. The SRSS combination rule was used in 
combining modal responses. Comparisons of the effective story shears and axial forces are 
shown in Table 6-25 and Figures 6-46 and 6-47 for a ZPA = 0.30 g. The estimated response 
spectrum shears and pile loads are close, with those from the simplified modal being 
overestimated by at most 10% relative to those from the 3-D analysis.

Demand-Capacity Analysis was conducted using the simplified methods for both major 
horizontal axes of the platform. Forces were assumed to act on all three axes simultaneously, 
with a proportion of 1.0/1.0/0.5 used to scale the primary lateral, secondary lateral, and 
vertical components. Diagonal brace capacities were determined including a local 
acceleration load from 1.0 g. As this platform has grouted legs, the strength of tubular brace- 
leg connections were not considered in the analysis.

The simplified method identifies hinging of the deck legs as the mechanism which governs 
the strength of the platform. An earthquake intensity of 0.31 g results in loads necessary to 
initiate a collapse mechanism in the deck bay; a fully-plastic mechanism will form at an 
intensity of 0.42 g. End-On and broadside demand-capacity curves are shown in Figures 6- 
49 and 6-50 for loads generated with a ZPA of 0.31 g; the deck section shear and base shear 
components shown are the resultants of the end-on and broadside shear components, while 
the shears at each jacket bay are the respective end-on and broadside components. From 
these curves, the next elements to yield would likely be the braces in the second broadside 
jacket bay, and the brace in the second and third end-on jacket bays.

Strengths for elements in the 3-D model were determined using information provided by 
Unocal (1998) and from relationships documented by Marshall, et al. (1977). The 3-D 
analysis also indicates the deck structure is the weak component in the platform; using the 
same loading strategy as for the simplified method, yielding begins in the deck frames and 
legs at an earthquake intensity of 0.33 g. This is very close to the intensity estimated from 
the simplified method-
6.5.3 Global Ductility Analysis
A simplified ductility analysis was performed for Platform E, and the results o f this analysis 
were compared to results from a static pushover analysis performed using PC-ANSR. Load 
patterns for the two principal directions were based on first mode forces; vertical excitation 
forces were applied acting downwards. Loads on the principal axes were scaled using 
relative ratios of 1.0 for end-on, 1.0 for broadside, and 0.5 for vertical.
Figure 6-51 shows the resultant displacements and base shears for Platform E for both the 
simplified analysis and the PC-ANSR analysis. The simplified analysis indicates the deck 
legs will yield at a total resultant base shear of 5,490 kips, and a fully-plastic mechanism will 
form in the upper deck section at a base shear of approximately 7,140 kips. These base 
shears correspond to principal axis components being scaled to an API Soil A spectrum ZPA 
of 0.42 g and 0.55 g respectively (Sa for the fundamental end-on period at these events is 0.19 
g and 0.25 g). Noting that the strength-level demand-capacity analysis indicates a spectrum 
ZPA of 0.31 g will result in deck leg yielding, the effective fundamental mode spectral

acceleration at yield should be scaled back by 28% or to 0.14 g to account for higher mode 
effects. As noted in the analysis of Platform D, this reduction can be very conservative. 
Using leg hinge ductility as the controlling criteria, the simplified method indicates Platform 
E is afcie to develop a global displacement ductility of approximately 1.6.
The PC-ANSR analysis confirms the trend identified by the simplified assessment; yielding 
occurs in the upper deck section at a resultant base shear of 5,153 kips, while a fully-plastic 
mechanism forms at a resultant base shear of 7,597 kips. Yielding corresponds to a spectral 
acceleration of 0.13 g including the reduction for higher mode effects. Using leg hinge 
ductility as the controlling criteria, the platform is able to develop a global displacement 
ductility of approximately 2.1.

The simplified analysis and PC-ANSR results are in good general agreement; the predicted 
yield points are within 5% of one another, while the predicted ultimate strengths are within 
approximately 8% of one another. The global displacement ductility of the platform is under­
predicted by the simplified method relative to application of PC-ANSR; this is due to the fact 
that yielding occurs gradually in the deck legs, as opposed to simultaneous yielding and 
hinging as is assumed by the simplified method.
6.5.4 Ductility-Level Demand-Capacity Analysis
Ductility-level comparisons were performed in two ways for Platform E: (1) by judging the 
effective load reduction R implied by the simplified displacement ductility analyses against 
scale factors F’ determined from MDOF nonlinear time history analyses, and (2) by judging 
the displacement modification FA implied by the simplified displacement ductility analyses 
against the ratio of the deck displacement found from the MDOF nonlinear time history 
analysis to the MDOF first mode component of displacement (assuming linear elastic 
behavior) for the same time history. Also, the mean fundamental lateral mode spectral 
acceleration Sa (assuming 5% damping) which represented the onset of nonlinear behavior in 
the platform was determined, to compare with the value determined in the global ductility 
analysis; this comparison checks the validity of indexing on first mode response to 
characterize platform strength capacity.
The PC-ANSR model used in Section 6.5.3 was utilized to determine F , the effective load

Rayleigh damping was assumed, with mass and stiffness-proportional coefficients balanced 
such that 5% critical damping was achieved in the first two fundamental lateral inodes.
The model was analyzed using a series of nine earthquakes (see Table 6-8). By conducting a 
series of analyses, the major component of motion was alternately placed on the principal 
axes of the platform, to ensure both frames would be subject to the most severe component of 
motion. Three damage measures were used: brace local ductility (using the cyclic limit as a 
target) global displacement ductility (using the allowable as determined from the ductility 
analyses), and leg-pile hinge ductility (using a limit of two as a target) were used as criteria 
for Fp The ratio of inelastic to elastic displacement was averaged for an overload of two, 
using a spectral acceleration of 0.13 g as a reference. The mean values of F for each damage 
measure, and the ratio of inelastic to elastic deck displacement, are shown in Tables 6-26 and
6-27.

From the results of the global ductility analyses in the previous section, it is reasonable to 
classify the platform as bilinear non-degrading. Referring to Figure 5-3, the effective load 
reduction, assuming the platform can develop a ductility of 1.6 to 2.1, would be in the range 
of 1.8 to 2.2. Given the target ductility for the MDOF analyses was effectively 2.0, and Fu 
was found to be slightly higher than 2.0 for both directions, it can be seen that the values 
estimated based on the results of the static analyses are in good agreement with those from 
the MDOF dynamic analyses. Similarly, referring to Figure 5-4, the ratio of inelastic to 
elastic displacement is expected to be close to unity. These results are also in good 
agreement with those obtained from the MDOF analyses.
Overall, the factors generated using the MDOF analyses are in good agreement with those 
found from the static analyses; however, as for Platform D, the issue of multi-mode effects 
indicates some caution is required when applying static methods. In this instance, multiple 
modal contributions tended to increase scatter in the results, as the weak links in the platform 
system (the deck bays) were sensitive to both multi-axis and higher-order modes.

6.5.5 Platform E: Summary of Results
Platform vibration properties estimated using the simplified method compare very well with 
those calculated by analyzing a full-frame model of the platform. Using the API Soil A 
response spectrum as a basis for loads, the simplified demand-capacity provides an excellent 
estimate of platform capacity, as expressed by response spectrum ZPA, as compared to 
results from use of the full-frame model.
The global ductility analyses indicated that multi and higher mode effects could be significant 
for this platform; the difference in effective yield spectral intensities was on the order of 30% 
for considering and not considering higher modes. The simplified ductility analysis captures 
the approximate global displacement limit of the platform, and the general hysteretic 
envelope is similar to that estimated by static pushover analysis for two configurations of 
horizontal framing. However, it must be noted that the envelope curve estimated by the 
simplified method is very approximate, being a semi-empirical representation of the pushover 
behavior of the platform; member local demands are not well-represented at large levels of 
global displacement.
MDOF response factors and elastic-to-inelastic deck displacement ratios derived from 
nonlinear time history analysis compare very well with factors and ratios selected based on 
the results of the global displacement ductility analyses; however, the effective yield strength 
of the platform was in between the two values estimated during the global ducdlity analyses. 
This case points out the difficulties of applying the simplified approach when multi-axis 
response and higher-ordered modes are an issue.

6.6 LARGE-SCALE APPLICATION OF SIMPLIFIED METHODS: 
BAY OF CAMPECHE PLATFORMS
In 1997 PEMEX/IMP undertook an effort to assess a number of aging platforms in the Bay of 
Campeche region, as documented by Perez, et al. (1998). Twenty platforms were analyzed 
by the program TOPCAT (Template Offshore Platform Capacity Assessment Tools), which 
performs the simplified analysis calculations; seventeen of these were also analyzed by the 
programs DAMS (Brown and Root, 1997) and SACS Collapse (EDI, 1997). DAMS is a 
modal analysis program which can generate force patterns for use with SACS Collapse. This 
effort by PEMEX/IMP (1999) presented an opportunity to perform further benchmarking of 
the simplified earthquake assessment approach on a large scale. Information on the 
TOPCAT program is documented in the User Manual by Stear and Bea (1999). Table 6-28 
lists the platforms and selected analytical results.
Comparisons were made between the following: (1) fundamental vibration periods estimated 
by DAMS and TOPCAT, (2) resultant base shears corresponding to the 200-year return 
period earthquake estimated by DAMS and TOPCAT, and (3) reserve strength ratios (RSRs) 
defined by the scale factor needed to increase the load pattern established from the 200-year 
return period earthquake to the point at which collapse has occurred. Collapse was defined in 
this case as the point of ultimate lateral strength. No accounting for dynamics, i.e. R factor 
load reduction, was taken in the analyses, so the results should be viewed as conservative.
Ratios of the TOPCAT/DAMS-SACS results were determined and are show in Figure 6-52. 
Table 6-29 shows the means of the ratios and the associated coefficients of variation. The

TOPCAT program tends to overestimate the fundamental periods of the structures, and 
correspondingly underestimate the base shear from the response spectrum. This is due to the 
fact that base shear determined from the response spectrum decreases with increasing period. 
The mean ratio of the RSRs is, surprisingly, 1.00; however, there is some statistical 
variability which encourages caution on the part of the analyst when applying the simplified 
methods. The significance of this variability is highlighted in Figure 6-52.

While there is a reasonably level trend in RSR for the first 12 platforms, the last 8 show wide 
variation. This is due in part to the limited nature by which structural configurations can be 
modeled in TOPCAT; the program requires special adaptation for certain structural 
configurations which was not done in for this test. The trend for the first 12 platforms also 
indicates TOPCAT is overpredicting the RSR relative to DAMS-SACS; however, this can 
likely be traced to underprediction of the initial load pattern.

The simplified methods as implemented in the TOPCAT program provide a reasonably 
accurate and affordable means of assessing platforms for earthquake loads. Based on the 
comparisons performed in this section, a bias of 1.15 should be used to factor up earthquake 
loads determined by the TOPCAT program. In addition, caution in needed when platforms of 
special configuration are encountered.
6.7 OBSERVATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS
The simplified methods documented within this chapter provide an effective static means of 
evaluating the dynamic performance of jacket-type platforms. The following are points of 
note from the analyses:
•  The vibration property-estimating approach is seen to work quite well for structures in 
less than 300 ft of water with grouted legs; for Platforms B and C, which did not have 
grout in the annulus, the simplified approach underpredicted the periods by approximately 
15%. Modal force estimates using the simplified properties compared well to those found 
using a 3-D model.
344

•  The capacities derived from the methods of Chapter Four compare well with capacities 
derived using more rigorous methods or empirical calibration. The simplified ductility 
analysis provides a fairly good qualitative assessment of global displacement ductility 
capacity; however, it is emphasized that this is a semi-empirical approach, and does not 
rigorously track member forces and load redistribution. The envelop curves derived from 
this method do not compare with those derived from a complete static pushover analysis; 
they are intended to qualitatively reflect the robustness of the platform based on 
component (deck bay, jacket bay, foundation) strength and post-yield behavior.
•  For platforms which possess long braces, the local load associated with excitation of the 
brace’s vibration modes can result in axial capacity reductions on the order of 10%. The 
most severe case would result from a platform with short (1 second or less) fundamental 
modes, and very flexible braces; however, this condition is unlikely to occur in practice. 
Nevertheless, it is important that these forces be accounted for when performing 
reassessments as well as preliminary design. Most braces will have periods much shorter 
than those associated with the vibration of the platform itself, and hence the braces may 
be treated as rigidly-mounted equipment with little or no additional amplification. In lieu 
of rigorously evaluating the brace-structure interaction, these preliminary results suggest 
that a local acceleration of twice the PGA of the API RP 2A (1993) spectrum used in the 
analysis is sufficient to envelope the associated excitation of braces in platforms with 
fundamental lateral periods in the range of 1.4 seconds to 2.9 seconds. However, 
additional case studies should be performed before this approximation is used in practice.

•  The response factors derived in Chapter Five compared reasonably well with those 
estimated using MDOF models. Effective dynamic capacity for a platform can be 
estimated using the relationship:
F77 -  elastic
where Feiastic is the base shear corresponding to the first mode forces determined from the 
elastic response spectrum for the level of earthquake excitation specified, and R is the 
load reduction factor associated with platform hysteresis. Fyieid is the base shear from first 
mode forces which results in yielding in the platform determined from the static pushover 
analysis. It must be noted that this base shear is not the true base shear from the 
earthquake; it is used as a convenient reference to quantify the total lateral load needed to 
induced yielding. However, it must be recognized that higher mode effects can have a 
significant effect on the indicated yield strength and post-yield behavior of a platform (by 
changing which component is the component to yield). Simply using first mode forces to 
derive post-yield behavior works well if the platform is first mode dominated. If it is not, 
a more effective means of biasing the strength of the platform must be found. As a gross 
approximation, it is possible to consider all modal forces when deriving the yield strength 
of the platform; however, this is deemed very conservative.
Based on the results of both the case studies and the PEMEX/IMP(1999) experience, the 
simplified approach appears suitable to the task of assessing platforms for earthquake loads. 
Care must be taken, however, when applying static methods to a dynamic problem. The

following guidelines should be taken as “good practice” recommendations when using 
response factor-modified static analysis for earthquake assessment:
•  Excitation should be considered on both principal axes (and both loading directions on 
each axis) as well as on the diagonal. For an 8-leg jacket with no symmetry in framing, 
this would correspond to performing eight analyses: four on the principal axes and four 
on the diagonals.
•  More than one load pattern should be used; as a minimum, a pattern associated with first 
mode forces and a pattern which results in demands similar to those from multi-mode 
excitation should be considered.
•  The response factor associated with the least combination of strength and ductility will 
govern the capacity of the platform. If several components are close to yield, the 
effective dynamic capacity should be determined based on the least ductile yield 
mechanism.
•  Ductile capacities of elements should be observed when using static methods. Elements 
such as braces might not be able to develop local ductilities higher than four or five, 
which can effectively limit the global ductility to two or less depending on the structural 
configuration.
Following these guidelines should ensure that ductile behavior is incorporated into a 
platform’s design without the need of resorting to time history analysis. However, it should 
be emphasized that these methods have been developed with application to shallow-water 
locations. Platforms in deeper waters, and platforms with a high consequence of failure,

should always be checked using time history analysis to ensure yield mechanisms develop as 
expected when the structure is subjected to severe earthquake ground motions.

CHAPTER SEVEN:
A SIMPLIFIED SEISMIC RELIABILITY ANALYSIS
7.0 INTRODUCTION
Previous chapters of this dissertation have focussed on deterministic analysis of platforms 
subjected to earthquakes. However, there are many uncertainties in both the expected ground 
motions and the structural properties of a platform which require application of probabilistic 
methods in order to obtain a more meaningful indication of analytically-predicted 
performance beyond the simple pass-fail result of a deterministic analysis.
Structural reliability methods provide an orderly approach for accounting for load and 
strength uncertainties in an earthquake assessment. Readers desiring detailed information on 
structural reliability are referred to Thoft-Christiansen and Baker (1981); only essential 
details are summarized here. Structural reliability can be approximately defined as the 
probability that a structure will not fail when subjected to a given load or set of loads over a 
set time interval. Structural reliability theory has two fundamental assumptions:
• Structural components exist in discrete “states.” For practical purposes, two-state 
behavior (either failed or unfailed) is often assumed.
• The state of a component can be described by a collection of random variables.
Assuming the load and strength behavior of a simple structural system is completely 
described by a set of random variables X(xIt X2, .... x„), and these variables possess a joint 
probability density function fx(x), and further assuming the state of the system is described by

a limit-state function g(x) such that g(x) < 0 indicates failure, the probability of failure p/ can 
be determined from the n-fold integral:
Simple linear limit-state functions with random variables demand S and capacity R can often 
be used to characterize the performance of structural elements, components, and complete 
systems:
For seismic reliability analysis, a variety of demand and capacity measures can be used; for 
example, S  can represent load, displacement, or hysteretic energy, and is hence compared 
with a corresponding R of yield strength, drift or ductility limit, or hysteretic energy 
absorption capacity. It is important to recognize, however, that S is determined from a 
combination of variables and analytical processes that relate general earthquake source 
parameters such as magnitude and distance to element, component and system demands for a 
specific structure. As noted in Chapters Two and Three, evaluation of S  is a multi-staged 
process; magnitude and distance are related to time-varying ground displacements at a given 
site location, which are then translated into demands using the dynamic equations of motion 
of the structural system as a transfer function. For linear (non-yielding) systems, this 
translation of ground motions into demands is relatively straight-forward, as the demand on 
linear systems can be evaluated using either MDOF time history analysis or superposition of

The reliability of the system ps is thus:

modal responses. However, performing this translation for yielding systems poses special 
challenges in assessing reliability due to the interaction of demand and capacity; in this case 
the demand-capacity interaction must be linearized or evaluated explicitly through the use of 
time history analysis.
Chapters Three, Four and Five have described a deterministic analysis framework by which 
the “global” demand-capacity behavior of a jacket-type platform subjected to earthquake 
excitation can be assessed. Using global forces as a common measure, yield limit state 
performance of a platform is governed by:
F  > Fyield — elastic
where Fyieij is the m inim um base shear determined from static pushover analysis which 
results in yielding of platform components, and Felastic is the force pattern used in the static 
pushover analysis scaled to an elastic response spectrum parameter (either Sa or ZPA). 
Ductile or collapse limit state performance of a platform is governed by:
Fyield > - ^ ^ -  or FyieldR > Felaslic
where R  is the effective reduction in elastic response spectrum forces which can be taken in 
recognition of yielding and hysteretic energy dissipation in the platform.
In this Chapter, a simple approach to evaluating the “global” yield and collapse reliabilities
of jacket-type platforms is developed, using the above limit state equations but recognizing
the demand, capacity and demand-capacity interaction are random variables. The yield and
collapse reliability of each platform component (deck bay, jacket bays, foundation) are
formulated using mean-value first-order second-moment (MVFOSM) approximations. Yield

and collapse behaviors of platform components are assumed to be governed by simple linear 
limit-state functions. The demand and capacity variables which make up these functions are 
assumed to be log-normally distributed. A platform is assumed to behave as a series system 
of components, whereby achieving a component yield or ductile limit state results in yielding 
or ductile failure of the platform. Hence, the “global” reliability of the platform structural 
system is bounded by assuming at the lower-bound that all component failure states are 
perfected correlated, and at the upper-bound that all component failure states are 
uncorrelated.
The yield and collapse reliabilities, as expressed by safety indices, of a small platform are 
determined using the simple approach. From these safety indices, the respective probabilities 
of yielding and collapsing are estimated. These failure probabilities are then compared to the 
yield and collapse probabilities determined from application of a more rigorous approach; in 
the rigorous approach, Monte Carlo simulation is used together with nonlinear time history 
analysis to evaluate the trend in platform behavior for 1000 random trials.
7.1 MVFOSM RELIABILITY ANALYSIS
The mean-value first-order second-moment (MVFOSM) reliability method has been 
developed to allow for solution of reliability problems when the actual joint probability 
density function governing system performance cannot be determined, and/or when the 
integration necessary to solve the probability of failure is too complex for practical solution. 
An excellent description of the method is contained in Mansour (1987); the essentials of the 
method are summarized here for completeness.

For a simple linear system with capacity R and demand 5, a safety margin M  can be defined 
as:
M = R — S
The mean jum and variance Om2 of M  are given by:
Mu =  M r  ~ M s
<?U = V 2R + ° 1 - ' 1 P R S ° R ° S
where:
Mr* Or — mean and standard deviation of capacity function 
Ms, Os = mean and standard deviation of demand function 
P rs — correlation between demand and capacity 
Defining a standardized margin G, such that G has zero mean and unit standard deviation,
G =
V J
the probability of failure p/ associated with the state M>  0 can be expressed by:
P ,  = F0( = ^ - ) =  Fa ( - 0 )
K&M J
where FM and Fa refer to the cumulative distribution functions. /? is referred to the safety 
index. If the distribution function Fc is known, then the exact probability of failure 
associated with /3 can be determined. For an unknown or unspecified distribution function, 
however, there will be a corresponding (though unspecified) probability of failure for each j3. 
Therefore, f3 can be taken as a safety measure when applying the MVFOSM method.

A ssum ing  both R and S are normally-distributed, the probability of failure can be found 
from:

The lognormal distribution is often found to provide a good fit to most variables in 
engineering applications (Ang, Tang, 1975). Assuming R and S to be lognormally- 
distributed, the limit state function M  can be expressed by:
M  — ln(/?) — ln(S)

A more-general formulation for M is discussed in the following. Assuming M  is a general

In the next two sections, approximate distributions for demand and capacity at the platform

7.2 PROBABILISTIC FORMULATION OF DEMAND
Earthquake demands for the simplified assessment approach are expressed as modal forces 
and moments from response spectrum analysis, as discussed in Chapter Three. Variability in 
the resulting component demands will depend upon the following, assuming linear structural 
response:
•  Variability in the response spectrum ordinates, for a given period and damping ratio.
355
Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.
•  Variability in structural periods, mode shapes and modal damping ratios.
•  Variability in the phasing between modes.
Variability in response spectrum ordinates is primarily due to Type I uncertainties. The input 
to the response spectrum, ground motion from earthquakes, is essentially a random process; 
in addition, there are uncertainties affecting the relationship between earthquake source 
parameters and the scale factors on the ground motion. Variability in load due to 
uncertainties in the structural system (masses, stiffnesses and damping values) is primarily 
due to Type II uncertainties. These can stem from the lack of statistical data on structural 
parameters, but will also reflect approximations in the way response is evaluated. Variability 
in the phasing between modes is a combination of Type I and Type II uncertainties; the phase 
is random, and there are approximations in how it is accounted for in an analysis. 
Determining the composite load variability and bias is discussed in the next three 
subsections.
7.2.1 Variability in Response Spectrum Ordinates
The ordinates of an elastic response spectrum are random variables, with scatter resulting 
from the range in responses to the family of ground motions used to make up the spectrum 
for each specific period and damping combination. The variability in the ordinates is 
dependent to some degree on the scale parameter used to derive the spectrum; use o f peak 
ground velocity (PGV) as a scale parameter typically provides less scatter in response 
spectrum ordinates than the use of peak ground acceleration (PGA) in the period range from 
1 to 2 sec and above for firm soil spectra, as noted by Naeim and Anderson (1993). This is

scaled) and 7-2 (PGA scaled) derived from the family of five time histories shown in Table 
7-1. Examining Figure 7-3, it is observed that scaling by PGA provides less variability in the 
period range below 2 sec, while PGV provides less variability for periods higher than 2 sec.

Much effort has been expended in studying appropriate distributions for elastic response 
spectrum ordinates; as noted by Miranda (1991) many studies have suggested the use of 
normal, log-normal, Rayleigh, exponential, Gumbel Type I, and gamma distributions. To 
evaluate the statistical properties of spectral ordinates, the ordinates associated with three 
periods (0.5 sec, 1.0 sec, 2.0 sec) from a mean elastic response spectrum developed from the 
spectra in Figure 7-2 were plotted in Figures 7-4, 7-5 and 7-6 for three distributions: log­
normal, normal, and exponential. It is observed the normal and log-normal distributions 
provide a reasonable fit; a Kolmogorov-Smimov test comparing the difference between the 
estimated and presumed probabilities showed the maximum differences were 0.27, 0.36 and 
0.37, respectively, for the three distributions. While recognizing this is a small (5) set of 
samples, the log-normal distribution will be assumed for spectral ordinates.

The variability in the ordinates will increase further when uncertainties in the earthquake 
source-PGA/PGV relationships and earthquake magnitude are considered; total variabilities 
(again expressed by COV) o f 300% have been noted by Bea (1991) for spectrum ordinates 
derived from a family of time histories from southern California earthquakes in the surface 
magnitude range of 6.0 to 6.5, with recording distances in the range of 20 km to 30 km. For 
the purposes of assessment, spectral ordinates are assumed to be linearly related to the 
scaling parameter PGA or PGV. Hence, the total variability in the spectral ordinates will be 
given by:
< r L , , = S l < r 2pG x+PG X 2crl
7.2.2 Variability Due to Structural Parameters
Additional variability will be introduced into the selection of response spectrum ordinates 
associated with each mode due to variations in structural parameters such as mass and 
stiffness, which affect period; the ordinates will also be affective by the assumed level of 
modal damping. Response spectrum forces will also be affected by changes in mode shape. 
However, providing mass, stiffness and damping COV’s are small, these additional sources 
of variability will have a minor effect when compared to the inherent variability in the 
spectral ordinates. To illustrate this point, a sensitivity study was performed using Platform 
A from Chapter Six (refer to Section 6.2). The parameters shown in Table 7-2 were varied 
according to the ranges shown, and the resulting range in fundamental period and response 
spectrum gross story shears (API Soil B response spectrum, ZPA = 0.25 g) were determined.

For this platform, structural parameters provide little additional variation in response, with 
the exception of modal damping ratios, which have a pronounced affect. As noted in Chapter 
Three, determination of the proper amount of modal damping to use is a challenge, as the 
damping is a representation of energy dissipation though localized material hysteresis and 
yielding of soil beneath the jacket. The damping will increase as the excitation increases; 
hence determination of this damping is an iterative process. In lieu of rigorously correlating 
damping and excitation, the following simplification is suggested:
• Damping is initially assumed at 5% critical for all platforms, and include jacket-bottom 
contact when determining foundation stiffness.
• If the induced loads exceed the strength of soil beneath the jacket (which is assumed to be 
the primary source of additional energy dissipation without grossly changing the 
platform’s vibration properties), recalculate the periods and mode shapes of the platform 
without including jacket-bottom contact, and recalculate loads using 10% critical 
damping.

7.2.3 Variability Due to Modal Combination
The last source of uncertainty is the phase between the modal response components. Phasing 
is somewhat dependent upon distance from the earthquake source; close to the source, 
components are more likely to be in phase, but at distant locations, the seismic wave trains 
will likely become separated in time. Unfortunately, phasing information is not contained in 
the response spectrum, and hence it is accounted from approximately through the use of 
modal combination rales. As noted in Chapter Three, the SRSS modal combination rule is 
widely used. According to Chopra (1995), it will generally provide excellent estimates of 
peak combined responses if:
•  Periods of the structure are well-separated (this can be overcome by use of the CQC rule), 
and damping is greater than 0.5%
•  Earthquake excitations have a wide band of frequencies with long phases of strong 
shaking (i.e. several times longer than the fundamental period of the structure)
The SRSS rule will become less accurate for short-duration impulsive ground motions and 
ground motions with many cycles of harmonic motion.
To account for variability in the modal combination, a simple bounding approach is taken. 
An upper-bound response will be determined from using the SRSS modal combination rale, 
while the lower-bound response will be taken as the single highest modal response.

Variance in the lower-bound response is assumed to be equal to the uncertainty in the 
associated response spectrum ordinate. The variance of the combined upper-bound modal 
responses will be given by the following:

where Rtomi is the SRSS combination of all responses 2?,-. All responses are assumed

7.3 PROBABILISTIC FORMULATIONS OF CAPACITIES
Strength and ductility capacities of platform elements and components have been formulated 
in Chapter Four. The strength of the platform system was described by either the base shear 
corresponding to yielding of a platform component, or the scale factor applied to the force 
pattern corresponding to yielding of a platform component. The effective ductile capacity of 
the platform was defined by the product of the strength of the platform and a response factor; 
this response factor was selected based on the post-yield load-displacement behavior the 
platform exhibited under a pattern of loads similar to first mode forces or an equivalent 
general load pattern. Response factors suitable for platform systems have been determined in 
Chapter Five.
Mean values of platform component strength and ductility, and hence platform system
strength and ductile capacities, can be determined using the mean values of the associated
element strengths and ductilities in the component capacity formulations. While component
strength and ductility uncertainties are small compared to the uncertainties in the loads, these
will be documented in this section for completeness.

7.3.1 Unbraced Bays
For the evaluation of mean and variance of unbraced deck bay strength and ductility, M y ,  P c r i  
and fi(p are treated as the controlling random variables. The relationships in Sections 4.1.1 
and 4.2.1 are used to develop the means and variances. Thus approximate mean yield

7.3.2 Braced Bays
For the evaluation of braced bay strength and ductility, the axial capacities of the braces and 
tubular joints, the local and batter forces, and the local ductility of braces are treated as 
random variables: Relationships from Sections 4.1.2 and 4.2.2 are used to develop the means 
and variances. Mean yield strength of a bay will be given by:

P u - i s t  will be given by the series joint-brace-joint system for each brace position. The mean 
and standard deviation of this system can be solved by first determining the cumulative 
distribution function for the combined system, and then applying numerical integration. 
Means and standard deviations for tubular joint strengths can be taken from test data. Mean 
brace compression capacity variance can be estimated by first re-arranging the equation 
governing brace performance:

Assuming the first term is equal to P c n  and assuming the calibration Ao is unity, the variance
is given by:

For the sake of simplicity, the mean of the acceleration used to derive the local load per unit 
length w is assumed to be equal to the peak spectral acceleration, and the variance in local 
load is assumed to be equal to the variance in peak spectral acceleration.
The maximum displacement the bay can tolerate will be given by:

The variance associated with the maximum displacement is estimated from:
 2 9 9 . 9  9o l  = H 'cfi + A~ O'“ mar fci
The latter two approximations assume all braces will have similar yield/buckling and cyclic 
ductility variances.
7.3.3 Foundation Lateral and Overturning
Relationships from Sections 4.1.3, 4.1.4 and 4.2.3 are used to estimate the mean strength and 
ductility of the foundation lateral and overturning mechanisms. However, as noted by 
Mortazavi and Bea (1997), the lack of data regarding modeling uncertainties precludes the 
ability to rigorously develop variances for the axial and lateral capacities of the piles. 
Instead, total capacity uncertainties, such as those documented by Tang and Gilbert (1990), 
will be used to establish the appropriate variances. For foundation lateral strength, these 
variances are combined with the variance in the batter forces to estimate the total variance.
7.3.4 Effective Component Ductility Capacities
Distributions of bay and foundation strength are assumed to be log-normally distributed, with 
means and variances established by the methods described in the previous subsections. 
Effective ductility capacities are also assumed to be log-normally distributed, but are 
estimated in the following manner. First, using either a load pattern associated with first­
mode forces or a uniform load pattern, the deck displacement associated with the mean 
yielding of each component is estimated. From this “global” yield point, the “global” post­
yield behavior of the platform is determined, using the procedures described in Section 4.3.
368

Based on the shape of the resulting load-displacement curve and the fundamental period of 
the platform, a load reduction factor R can be estimated using the modified relationship for 
Fe described in Section 5.3.3 or by studying the graphs for R as related to specific systems in 
Chapter Five. The variance in the selection o f this factor is taken to be equal to the variance 
of the component ductility that can be developed in the respective collapse mechanism.
In addition to the variance associated with factor selection, there is also the inherent variance 
of the factor itself. Distributions for three o f the response factors from Chapter Five have 
been plotted in Figures 7-7, 7-8, 7-9, 7-10, 7-11 and 7-12. All factors are have been derived 
from the analysis of the bilinear degrading system; results are presented at three periods for 
two levels of ductile capacity. It is observed that the log-normal distribution provides a 
reasonable fit to the statistical information collected; a Kolmogorov-Smimov test comparing 
the difference between the estimated and presumed probabilities showed the maximum 
difference for the factors considered was 0.20. Hence, the total variance associated with the 
effective load reduction is the sum of the variance in factor selection and the variance 
inherent to the factor.
Once a response factor has been established, the ductile capacity of the component is taken as 
the product of the component yield or static strength and the response factor:
F  =  F  Rdynamic static

Hence, ductile behavior of platform components are represented by establishing an 
“effective” dynamic strength. The composite variance associated with the dynamic strength 
is given by:
cr  = F~-(Jr + R-<j i
* dynamic Static n  •m u te
It must be remembered that these dynamic strengths are determined by assuming damage 
concentrates in the component after it yields as described in Section 4.3.
7.4 PLATFORM YIELD AND COLLAPSE PROBABILITIES
Platform yield probability is established by first evaluating the yield reliability (3 o f each 
platform component (deck bay, jacket bays, foundation lateral and overturning) for 
earthquake forces; the demands and capacities are assumed to be log-normally distributed. 
Probabilities of failure are then determined for each component using:
Pf  =®{~P)
Yield probability of the platform system is then bounded by considering the platform to 
behave as a series system. At the lower bound, all platform components are assumed 
perfectly correlated, and thus p/.y of the platform is given by:
N
Pf-y=lLPf,<=I
At the upper bound, all platform components are assumed uncorrelated, and ppy is given by:
Pf_y=max(pf')
373
Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.
Collapse probability of the platform is established by first evaluating the dynamic strength 
reliability of each platform component for earthquake forces. Again, demands and capacities 
are assumed to be log-normally distributed. Probabilities of failure are then determined from 
the safety index as with for yield probabilities of failure, and overall collapse probability is 
bounded in the same manner. The upper bound probability of failure should itself be 
bounded based on whether or not damage concentrates in the first component to yield; 
however, it is conservative to assume the platform collapse capacity is governed by the single 
component with the highest probability of failure, regardless of whether that component was 
also the most likely to yield. This distinction is diagrammed below in Figure 7-13.

associated with an arbitrary level of “severe earthquake.” For comparison purposes, the yield 
and collapse probabilities of the simple platform have also been determined using Monte 
Carlo simulation together with time history analysis.
The platform analyzed for the exercise is Platform A. Particulars of the platform can be 
found Chapter Six (Section 6.2). For the purposes of the reliability assessment, stiffness, 
mass and modal damping ratios (Rayleigh damping was assumed to develop damping 
coefficients for the time history analysis; 5% critical was assumed) of the platform structure 
were assumed to be constant. Joint failure in the platform was neglected. The COV’s 
assumed for different platform structural variables are shown in Table 7-3.

7.5.1 Simplified Reliability Method
Vibration properties for the platform were determined using the simplified modal method 
described in Chapter Three, and are listed in Section 6.1.1. To account for variability in the 
response spectrum ordinates due to foundation stiffness uncertainty, the foundation lateral 
and rotational stiffnesses were approximately related to first mode period by the following 
period lengthening relationship:
where:

T\ = fixed-base fundamental period
T0 = natural period of foundation mass
k\ = effective horizontal stiffness of fixed-base fundamental
Kx = horizontal stiffness of foundation
Ke = rotational stiffness of foundation
hC = effective mass center above base, not including foundation mass 
The effective horizontal stiffness may be approximated by:
( 0 .9  M l )
where:
Mi = inertial mass of platform (it is assumed the first lateral mode has 90% mass 
participation)
The natural period of the foundation mass may be estimated from:
where:

variability in all periods due to foundation flexibility. To carry this variability through to 
load uncertainty, the relationship between T  and Sa is linearized at the mean value of T.
Effective load reduction was determined based on the likely collapse mechanisms to form: 
collapse of deck or jacket bays, foundation lateral subsidence, or foundation overturning. For 
each mechanism, the global ductility which could be tolerated was established, and then used 
to select an R factor to modify the associated yield capacity. The platform was assumed to 
possess “strong” horizontal framing for the purpose of determining jacket capacity. Hence, 
load reduction factors for the deck and jacket bay mechanisms were selected from Figure 5- 
27. The foundation mechanisms were assumed to exhibit minimal softening and strength 
reduction, hence Figure 5-3 was used to select load reduction factors for these mechanisms. 
The uncertainty associated with effective load reduction R was set at 30%. Reviewing the 
graphs in Chapter Five, it is seen 30% provides a reasonable bound on COV/? in the 
neighborhood of the fundamental period of this platform for different load reduction 
mechanisms.
Table 7-4 depicts the mean and COV for loads and platform component capacities and the 
associated component safety indices for yielding. Results for both lower-bound and upper- 
bound loading are shown. The mean and COV of the global ductility attainable in each 
mechanism and the associated effective load reduction R is shown in Table 7-5, along with 
safety indices for collapse.

Probabilities of yielding and collapse are shown in Table 7-6 based on individual component 
strengths and collapse mechanisms. Using the concept o f upper and lower bounds on yield 
and collapse, it is observed that the lower bound on yielding probability is 7.5% (yielding of 
1st jacket bay braces), while the upper bound is 17.4%. Similarly, the lower bound on 
collapse probability is 0.5% (hinging of piles, although 1st jacket bay braces are close), while 
the upper bound is 2.3%.

7.5.2 Monte Carlo Simulation with Time History Analysis
A Monte Carlo simulation was performed to benchmark the results of the simplified 
reliability method. The Monte Carlo simulation consisted of performing 1000 trials, with 
each trial consisting of a time history analysis of Platform A using the program ANSR. For

the Monte Carlo simulation, the variables listed in Table 7-3 were varied in accordance with 
the means and variances listed assuming log-normal distribution. The time history scale 
factor was varied according to the mean and variance listed above; the actual ground motion 
time history used with each run was selected randomly according to a uniform distribution.
1000 trials conducted in order to determine the associated probabilities of failure for the 
yielding and collapse condition. Yield was defined as the yielding of any element, while the 
collapse condition was established by exceeding the cyclic ductility of any element. Based 
on the results of the simulation, the probability of yielding during the severe earthquake was 
determined as 9 1 /1 0 0 0  or 9.1% . T h is compares very well with the lower bound estimated 
from the sim plified method. The probability of collapse during the severe earthquake was 
determined as less than 1/1000 or < 0.1%; cyclic ductilities were not exceeded during any of 
the trials conducted. This estimate also compares favorably with the lower bound estimated 
from the simplified analysis.
7.5.3 Comparison of Results
The bounded probabilities of failure determined in the simplified reliability assessment 
compare favorably with those from the simulation exercise. The orders of magnitude are 
similar for both the yield and collapse probabilities; however, the simulation exercise did not 
contain enough trials to sufficiently resolve collapse probabilities. However, the simplified 
values should clearly be sufficient for the purposes of preliminary screening. In addition, the 
exercise confirms that the use of static methods to resolve the demand-capacity evaluation 
for this platform is sufficient in comparison with time history analysis.

It should be noted that this exercise has been framed in terms of reliability against an 
arbitrary level of severe earthquake. Hence, the probabilities determined are for satisfaction 
of the yield and collapse limit states for that severe event. This information can easily be 
used to construct annual or lifetime probabilities of yield or collapse, by combining the 
event-specific results with the probability of occurrence of severe earthquakes. Thus, annual 
probabilities of failure would be given by:
P  f-annua l ( p  / 1 severe ^ P  severe—annual
7.6 CONCLUSIONS
A simplified seismic reliability analysis procedure using the mean-value first-order second- 
moment (MVFOSM) method has been presented. Reliability is resolved at the component 
level, assuming yield and collapse demands and capacities are log-normally distributed. 
Overall platform yield and collapse probabilities of failure are then determined by 
considering the platform to behave as a series system. Upper and lower bounds are 
determined by alternately considering the behavior of components to either be uncorrelated 
or perfectly correlated.
An example simplified reliability analysis has been conducted using a simple platform. 
Annual yield and collapse probabilities determined by application of the simplified method 
were compared to yield and collapse probabilities determined through application of Monte 
Carlo simulation and time history analysis. The probabilities of yield and collapse are found 
to bound the simulation results quite well.

CHAPTER EIGHT: 
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.0 SUMMARY
Although the number of platforms in seismically-active regions remains small today, with 
new technology extending the life of old oil fields, these platforms are being called upon to 
serve past their original design lives. While there exist comprehensive structural analysis 
programs capable of determining the nonlinear response of large jacket-type platforms in the 
time domain, these programs require a high degree of expertise and computational resources 
to operate.
In this study, simplified procedures have been developed to assess the structural integrity of 
jacket-type platforms for earthquake loading. The following issues have been addressed:
• Determination of platform vibration properties; simple procedures for deriving the 
principal vibration properties of a platform were developed and tested.
• Estimate forces on platform components from earthquake excitation; using the modal 
properties from the vibration procedure together with a response spectrum, reasonable 
estimate of component loads were established.
• Estimate platform displacements and accelerations at different framing levels; this is 
accomplished using methodology associated with determining the response of mounted 
equipment.
• Determination of the strength and ductility of platform structural components; using 
virtual work, the strength of likely collapse mechanisms in the platform can be

determined, while through consideration of platform element cyclic ductilities and the 
presumption of damage concentration in a collapse mechanism, estimates of the global 
displacement ductility which can be tolerated in platform component mechanisms can be 
made.
• Determination of the effective increases in static lateral load capacity of platform systems 
by implicitly accounting for the nonlinear hysteretic action of a yielding platform system. 
68,816 SDOF systems with four types of hysteresis were analyzed, and both effective 
reduction in elastic load R and displacements of nonlinear systems normalized by 
displacements of linear systems were evaluated. Adjustments to an earlier rule on 
deriving load reduction factors were suggested. Comparisons were also made between 
yielding MDOF and SDOF systems to evaluate the utility of using SDOF R factors to 
represent load reduction/effective capacity increase in MDOF systems.
• Developing a simplified reliability framework by which estimates of platform yield and 
collapse probabilities can be estimated. A MVFOSM approach was taken to formulating 
platform component yield and collapse reliabilities; from these reliabilities, bounds on the 
probabilities of yielding and collapse can be estimated.
• Verification of the simplified procedures; six case studies and seven examples were 
performed to evaluate the simplified methods.
• Development of software which performs the simplified procedures; a program called 
TOPCAT (Template Offshore Platform Capacity Assessment Tools) has been developed 
to perform the simplified demand and capacity analyses described herein. This program 
is documented in the User Manual by Stear and Bea (1999).

8.1 CONCLUSIONS
The effective reduction in elastic load R due to nonlinear hysteresis has been evaluated for 
68,818 nonlinear SDOF systems with four general types of nonlinear behavior: bilinear non­
degrading, bilinear stiffness-degrading, stiffness and strength degrading, and strength 
degrading. This study confirms the dependence of R on period and local soil conditions, and 
has resulted in proposed modifications to a simple rule used from estimating effective load 
reduction from static analysis. In addition, the displacements of nonlinear systems 
normalized by the displacements of equivalent linear systems (i.e. with the same period and 
damping) have been studied, and a displacement ratio factor Fa has been developed; results 
indicate the “equal displacements” rule is a good approximation for determining the 
displacement of a nonlinear SDOF system from the displacement of an equivalent linear 
system, but is also sensitive to period and local soil conditions. Use of SDOF systems to 
represent the response of MDOF systems appears to be a good approximation so long as the 
MDOF system is 1st mode dominated, i.e. participating mass in the first mode is 70% to 80%. 
The factors developed in this study should be of use in further enhancing simple preliminary 
design procedures for yielding structures.
The results of the deterministic case studies in Chapter Six indicate the simplified procedures 
developed in Chapters Three and Four provide estimates of platform demand-capacity 
behavior which are in good agreement with the results of more detailed analyses. Periods 
and mode shapes were estimated within 17% of those found using 3-D frame models; 
associated response spectrum loads were determined within a similar margin. Simplified 
procedures used to estimate global displacement ductility provided reasonable identification

of collapse mechanisms and the ductility which could be tolerated in those mechanisms; 
ductility tended to be estimated on the low side by was within ~20% of the ductility 
estimated from a static pushover analysis. Finally, the /^-factor modified static capacities of 
the platforms were found to give good approximations to the dynamic performance of the 
platforms, and the equal displacement rule was again confirmed to be a reasonable 
approximation. A large-scale assessment exercise of twenty platforms has further confirmed 
the utility of the simplified methods in the screening of platform fleets.
The reliability exercise performed as part of Chapter Seven has highlighted the importance of 
including the effects of uncertainties on response; while earthquake loads tend to have large 
inherent (Type I) uncertainties, platform components such as piles can also have significant 
uncertainty (Type II), due to lack of data regarding soil properties and an inability to 
represent local nonlinear effects such as strain-rate strength dependence outside of a detailed 
context. These uncertainties will change the focus of likely failure modes, as seen in the 
example. The use of the simplified methods together with bounding approximations on 
platform loads result in probabilities of yielding and collapse which are in reasonable 
agreement with those found from simulation analysis.
It is clear the simplified procedures documented herein can provide a reasonable basis for 
assessing structural integrity. However, the procedures can also be used in preliminary 
design and the checking of more involved analyses. Given the recent progress in computer 
technology, it is not unlikely that within ten years, an analysts will have the capability to 
develop extremely detailed models of structures and analyze them for a variety of complex

dynamic loading. It should be remembered, however, that as systems become more capable 
of representing detail, they also become more prone to error via mistakes in data entry or a 
lack of physical understanding on the part of the user. Simplified procedures such as the one 
outlined herein provide very useful “sanity checks” against the results of detailed analysis 
program s, and emphasize physical understanding; hence, simplified procedures should 
always have a place in an analyst’s toolbox.
8.2 RECOMMENDATIONS
Further verification of the simplified procedures documented within this study should be 
performed. In particular, the platforms studied herein tended towards shallow depth with 
heavy decks; these structures are clearly first-mode dominated. Loads in the simplified 
assessment procedure are bounded, in order to envelope both multi-mode effects and yielding 
of platform systems; it would be interesting to apply the procedures to the evaluation of 
several of the very deep (600 ft +) structures currently located in seismically-active regions.
Additional data should be obtained to further develop the simplified ductility estimating 
procedures described in Chapter Four. Additional data needs to be collected on the cyclic 
ductility of braces and beam-columns. These limits, while simplified, provide a designer 
with an excellent starting point in the identification of what limits should be taken in both 
static and dynamic analyses of structures subjected to earthquake excitation. It must be 
recognized that many analysts still rely upon numerical instability as a limit in the analysis of 
structures, without rigorously addressing what could be low-cycle fatigue or other limits 
which are not explicitly addressed by computer analysis software.
386

A great weakness of using static methods is the inability to account for load duration. One 
means of approximating the duration is to use input energy spectra. While this assessment 
process suggests the use of cyclic ductility limits, which represent an upper-bound of the 
likely number of extreme-displacement cycles within which no serious degradation occurs, a 
more satisfactory approach would be to develop dual strength criteria: one limit based on a 
maximum excursion, and other based on energy which much be absorbed.
Foundations still provide a significant source of uncertainty. Behavior of the foundation 
system is bounded so as to capture its impact on platform vibration properties and hence 
induced earthquake loads. Development and verification of simplified procedures to account 
for soil sampling, testing, and cyclic-dynamic loading conditions is a significant research 
topic. It has been established from field tests that jacket-bottom contact is a significant 
source of stiffness, and that effective modal damping increases as excitation of these 
structures increases; simple methods for estimating the relationship between damping and 
excitation are needed.
The factors documented in this study should contribute significandy to the body of 
knowledge which has developed around this subject over the past thirty years. However, 
additional research is needed on response factors for nonlinear systems. In particular, the 
application of response factor techniques to large multi-story buildings should be considered. 
In addition, response factors for non-standard structures such as bridges and unique buildings

should also be considered. Another source of research would be response factors for piping 
and refinery and powerplant equipment.

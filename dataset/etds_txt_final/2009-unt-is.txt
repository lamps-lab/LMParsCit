circuits. Doctor of Philosophy (Computer Science and Engineering), May 2009, 131 pp., 27 
tables, 63 illustrations, 130 references. 
New circuit design techniques that accommodate lower supply voltages necessary for 
portable systems need to be integrated into the semiconductor intellectual property (IP) core. 
Systems that once worked at 3.3 V or 2.5 V now need to work at 1.8 V or lower, without causing 
any performance degradation. Also, the fluctuation of device characteristics caused by process 
variation in nanometer technologies is seen as design yield loss. The numerous parasitic effects 
induced by layouts, especially for high-performance and high-speed circuits, pose a problem for 
IC design. Lack of exact layout information during circuit sizing leads to long design iterations 
involving time-consuming runs of complex tools. There is a strong need for low-power, high-
performance, parasitic-aware and process-variation-tolerant circuit design.  This dissertation 
proposes methodologies and techniques to achieve variability, power, performance, and 
parasitic-aware circuit designs. Three approaches are proposed: the single iteration automatic 
approach, the hybrid Monte Carlo and design of experiments (DOE) approach, and the corner-
based approach. Widely used mixed-signal circuits such as analog-to-digital converter (ADC), 
voltage controlled oscillator (VCO), voltage level converter and active pixel sensor (APS) have 
been designed at nanoscale complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) and subjected to 
the proposed methodologies. The effectiveness of the proposed methodologies has been 
demonstrated through exhaustive simulations. Apart from these methodologies, the application 
of dual-oxide and dual-threshold techniques at circuit level in order to minimize power and 
leakage is also explored.

CHAPTER 1 
INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION 
  The demand for low-power consuming circuits is increasing with the requirements for 
personal computing devices and wireless communications equipment. Several factors, such as 
battery life, heat dissipation, packaging costs, environmental concerns, and reliability issues are 
driving this demand [83]. Mechanisms such as voltage reduction, frequency scaling, and clock 
gating are helpful in reducing power consumption of the target systems for different applications 
[85]. Power management is fast becoming one of the most critical design constraints in the world 
of integrated circuit (IC) designers. New 90 nanometer (nm) processes deliver greater silicon (Si) 
performance and integration, but battery technology has not kept up. To compensate, new design 
techniques are being developed to address the need for low-power silicon. Dynamic power 
management techniques using variable supply voltage (variable V ) are popular for system-level 
dd
power reduction, and multiple supply voltage (MSV) is a static solution for switching power 
reduction in application specific ICs (ASICs) [18]. 
  The major components of total power dissipation in any circuit can be identified as 
P , the switching power dissipation; P , the short-circuit power dissipation; and 
switching short-circuit
P , the leakage power from various sources. Each one of these power dissipation sources is 
leakage
dependent on supply voltage, some linearly and some quadratically. For example, switching 
power has a quadratic relationship with the power supply voltage V . Hence, a significant 
dd
amount of power can be saved by simply reducing the supply voltage V . However, the power 
dd
reduction puts a strain on the performance targets. Since lowering the supply voltage slows down 
the speed at which transistors can switch, one must be selective in determining which parts of the 
design should have the voltage reduced (known as voltage scaling). Voltage scaling requires 
1  
partitioning of the design into voltage islands or voltage domains. Each domain operates at a 
different supply voltage depending on its timing characteristics [86]. The blocks that are time-
critical in one domain operate at the standard supply voltage. The less time-critical blocks are 
aggregated into a second domain, with the voltage scaled down. A challenge with voltage scaling 
is the need to translate the voltages for the signals that interface between voltage domains. This 
translation is accomplished by inserting level shifters, which are special cells that perform 
voltage translation [57], and clamp cells to provide isolation. Basically, there are two types of 
voltage converters: level-up and level-down. A level-up converter is used as an interface in 
which low V  cells (V ) drive high V  cells (V ) in order to reduce the short-circuit power 
dd ddl dd ddh
dissipation [129]. One application is the dual-V  field programmable gate array (FPGA) fabric 
dd
[78]. Level-down converter is required for switching power reduction, where the non-critical 
blocks of the circuit are made to operate at a lower-power supply voltage [57]. In the standby 
mode of a circuit, no active switching occurs, and all power dissipation is due to standby 
leakage. A simple power-saving scheme could be to shut off unused blocks in the standby mode. 
  Portable electronic components such as cell phones, which are realized as systems on a 
chip (SoCs) and supplied with power from a single battery source require level converters. Such 
electronic devices often contain several sub-circuits, with each sub-circuit requiring a unique 
voltage level different from that supplied by the battery (sometimes higher or lower than the 
battery voltage). Level converters offer a method of generating multiple controlled voltages from 
a single, rather than multiple batteries, thereby saving space and cost to supply different parts of 
the device. They can also be effectively applicable for large-scale integration (LSI) high-speed 
input-output circuits, as an interface between internal and external buses as a server or 
2  
exchanger. They can also be used as an interface circuit between optical devices for optical 
communications [129] or as interfaces between different logic families. 
1.1. Issues Faced by Digital, Analog, and Mixed-Signal Circuits 
  The main issues faced by digital, analog, and mixed-signal circuits of today are as 
follows: 
1.1.1. Technology Scaling 
  A large number of SoCs are manufactured nowadays in the 90 nm process node, and the 
ramp up for 65 nm design has become more aggressive than expected. The 45 nm process design 
is following close behind, with early versions of design rules and process parameters already 
available [5, 4]. Intellectual property (IP) core providers are faced with the challenge of meeting 
analog performance in a technology that has been targeted for digital logic. New circuit design 
techniques that accommodate lower supply voltages necessary for portable systems also need to 
be integrated into the IP core. Systems that once worked at 3.3 volts (V) or 2.5 V now need to 
work at 1.8 V or lower without causing any performance degradation. The need for greater 
processing speed has designers craving smaller device geometries. Smaller devices provide 
higher packing density and lower overall power consumption, due to lower parasitics and lower 
supply voltages. This shortening of the minimum channel length has resulted in the reduction of 
power supply voltage to the 1 V - 0.7 V range. The SoC trend also forces analog circuits to be 
integrated with digital circuits. To keep up with the scaling of the minimum channel length and 
SoC trend, analog circuits need to be operated at low voltages, especially in portable devices. 
However, the minimum supply voltage for analog circuits predicted in the semiconductor road 
map [5] does not follow the reduction of digital supply voltage. Analog supply voltages between 
1.8 V and 2.5 V are still being used with channel lengths of 0.18 micrometer (µm) and 0.13 µm 
3  
[30]. Hence, it is a great challenge to design low supply voltage operating analog/mixed-signal 
circuits while considering the relatively high threshold voltage of short channel length 
transistors.  
  Another important consideration for an SoC is that the analog/mixed-signal circuits 
should be designed by using a standard complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) 
digital process without having process options such as deep n-well or on-chip inductors or 
varactors.  
  Analog circuit designs often contain matched transistors [98]. The threshold voltage of a 
metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) transistor is defined as the gate voltage required to induce a 
channel for current flow through the transistor [99]. Matched CMOS transistors are designed to 
be necessarily identical. During fabrication, the threshold voltage of an MOS transistor is 
engineered to a desired voltage using processing. In a typical MOS field effect transistor (FET) 
process, ion-implanted charges are used to shift the threshold voltage. This processing step, 
called the threshold voltage adjustment implant, is random, consisting of varying energy levels 
of the implanted ions and subsequent temperature ramp step to diffuse the ions. The random 
nature of this process results in the random fluctuations in threshold voltage as a function of 
transistor area. Additionally, random variations in the lithography result in small geometric 
inaccuracies. The variation of the effective threshold voltage (V ) increases as the transistor 
T
areas decrease. In CMOS analog circuits, it is the variation of the threshold voltages between two 
transistors rather than their absolute voltage values that is of interest for the majority of 
applications. Hence, it is essential to analyze the effect of threshold voltage mismatch on the 
analog circuit performance. Because the threshold voltage, mobility, and channel length of a 
device are sensitive to temperature variations [10], a temperature sensitivity analysis also needs 
4  
to be carried out. In addition, the power supply voltage variations in the analog design have been 
accounted for, to verify its system-on-chip capability. 
1.1.2. Power Performance 
  A dichotomy exists in the design of ICs: They must be simultaneously low power and 
high performance. Minimum power expenditure is joined at the hip to performance today. The 
goal of power-aware design is to minimize power consumption while meeting performance 
requirements. Therefore, as power dissipation increases, the cost of power delivery to the ever-
increasing number of transistors on a chip multiplies rapidly. Power conservation impacts every 
budget, whether technological or financial. Product acceptability, reliability, and profitability 
depend as much on power efficiency as they do on performance. There is a difference between 
low-power design and power-aware design [97]. Low-power design refers to minimizing power 
with or without a performance constraint. Power-aware design refers to maximizing some other 
performance metric, subject to a power budget. 
1.1.3. Process Variation 
  The fluctuation of device characteristics caused by process variation has considerably 
increased in nanometer technologies. Process variations can be classified into inter- and intra-die 
[92]. Inter-die variation, which comes from lot-to-lot, wafer-to-wafer, and within wafer, affects 
every device on a single chip equally. On the other hand, intra-die variation refers to device 
characteristics such as device geometry change, dopant density change, threshold voltage, gate 
oxide thickness, and circuit timing change, which vary from device to device within the same 
die. Some of the variations are random and some are systematic. 
  Capturing and modeling the intra-die process variation becomes essential to device and 
interconnect extraction tools for accurate timing and power analysis. The standard design cycle 
5  
must include process variation in order to produce variation-tolerant physical designs. Just as in 
digital design where interconnect delays make or break a design, the move to 90 nm and lower 
process technologies means that the variations in process parameters have a resounding effect on 
the performance metrics of analog/mixed-signal, memory and radio-frequency (RF) circuits. 
Unlike a digital circuit, which is typically optimized only for speed and power, an analog circuit 
is designed to meet as many as 5 to 10 performance metrics. As a result, the impact of these 
process variations is seen as design yield loss, which in turn directly bites the bottom line of a 
company's profits. This loss calls for a proactive and a deterministic way to deal with 
performance and yield while in the design phase and not after the first silicon. 
1.1.4. Parasitics 
  Parasitic-aware optimization methodologies require that the parasitics be considered at 
the beginning of the design [96]. Where IC components are designed assuming ideal 
components, it is observed that parasitics have serious degrading effects at high frequencies. The 
only way to overcome these effects is to consider parasitics as an integral part of the circuit. 
Thus, parasitic-aware design and optimization are essential. If parasitics have an acute effect on 
the design, an early layout needs to be created so that the parasitics can be extracted and their 
effect estimated. Without that early layout-parasitic information, designers rely mostly on 
experience. If a design is understood well enough to know the sensitive nodes, dummy elements 
can be placed on those nodes to mimic the effect of real parasitics. This process is tedious and 
error-prone. Therefore, a methodology is required which can achieve the required performance 
while accounting for the parasitics. Hence, there is a need for a design methodology accounting 
for parasitics and process variation of general IC components.  
1.1.5. Temperature Variation 
6  
  Another emerging critical issue due to technology scaling is the effect of on-die 
temperature variation [21]. What was previously a second-order effect that could be adequately 
addressed with a few corner cases and guardbands has now become a first-order effect. 
Temperature interacts with a number of these other issues in ways that make analysis difficult. 
There's a need for new, temperature-aware design methodologies in order to produce properly 
functioning and reliable first silicon. Both power dissipation and operating frequency worsen at 
high temperatures because of the increase of leakage currents and the reduction of carrier 
mobility. The challenge for RF design is centering of a design including process, voltage and 
temperature (PVT) variations. By integrating temperature-aware capabilities into today's design 
flows, there is no need to rewrite the golden analysis standards that have been established for the 
past decade. Instead, through the use of tools that incrementally retrofit today's flows with 
temperature-aware data, the temperature effects can be fully accounted for. Applying thermal 
analysis reduces pessimism or risk associated with the assumption of a uniform on-chip 
temperature. A temperature-aware design flow is useful for existing technologies down to 90 nm, 
and is required for technologies below 90 nm. 
  In summary, the demand for emerging application-specific, nanoscale mixed-signal SoCs 
which need process (threshold voltage mismatch) variation-tolerant low-power high-performance 
parasitic-aware mixed-signal circuitry and development of mature nano-CMOS processing 
technology has motivated this research.

THEORETICAL BACKGROUND 
  This chapter presents the theoretical background related to the work presented in this 
dissertation. Section 2.1 discusses the current emerging technologies, considering the ongoing 
trends of the market. This discussion includes nanoscale complementary metal oxide 
semiconductor (nano-CMOS) transistors, high-κ metal gate transistors, fin field effect transistors 
(FET) (dual-gate FETs) and carbon nanotube transistors (CNT). Section 2.2 discusses the power 
leakage and delay models used for measurement. Finally, section 2.3 gives an overview of the

2.1. Emerging Technologies 
  Since their first demonstration in 1960 [5], planar silicon metal oxide semi-conductor 
field effect transistors (Si MOSFETs) have experienced a steady exponential downsizing of their 
critical dimensions. Over a period of 45 years, the printed gate lengths of the MOSFETs have 
been scaled down from 100 µm to 35 nm; the latter refers to the gate lengths for the 65 nm 
technology node devices in commercial microprocessors that are currently available. Because of 
a steady improvement of their performances through scaling, MOSFETs have become the 
leading integrated circuit (IC) technology for high-performance and low-power logic 
applications. Over this long period of development, the technology has faced numerous 
challenges, which were always solved by vigorous research, ingenious design, and brilliant 
engineering. The exponential scaling down of the feature sizes, and hence the exponential 
increase of the transistor count in an IC was first observed by Gordon Moore in 1965 [88]. His 
observation, which later became known as Moore's law, states that the number of transistors per 
9  
IC doubles every 24 months. Moore's law has been serving as the guiding principle for the 
semiconductor industry for over 30 years. 
  According to projections by the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors 
(ITRS), by the middle of next decade, the printed gate length of the MOSFETs will be less than 
10 nm [38]. Since no exponential can continue forever, sustaining Moore's law is becoming 
challenging for the planar bulk CMOS technology, for which the key technical issue for scaling 
devices below the 32 nm node is the high off-state leakage current [103]. The origin of this 
scaling limit for the single-gate, bulk CMOS technology can be traced back to the inherent poor 
electrostatic design of the planar device geometry and the poor transport properties of carriers in 
the Si channels. Consequently, an intense research effort, directed toward exploring new device 
designs and new channel materials for future logic technologies, has recently been undertaken. 
  Dual-gate devices and carbon nanotube transistors [110] show promise for scaling 
beyond the planar bulk MOSFET limit. The electrostatic integrity of the nanoscale CMOS 
devices improves considerably when additional gates are included, such as for dual-gate or 
finFET devices. Because these non-planar devices are inherently resistant to short-channel-
effects, it is widely believed that one of them will form the basic device architecture for future 
generations of CMOS devices. In order to sustain Moore's law for over four decades, nearly all 
materials and design aspects of the original MOSFET have been lost, except the use of Si-silicon 
dioxide (SiO ) material system as channel material and gate insulator. Aggressive scaling of gate 
2
oxide has reduced its thickness to a present-day value of about 1 nm, and any further thinning is 
prohibitive because of oxide reliability issues and the exponential increase of leakage current 
from direct tunneling. Sustaining Moore's law, however, depends crucially on the gate insulator 
scaling; consequently, replacing SiO  with high-κ dielectric-metal gate stack is within sight [39].

Among all semiconductors, although Si has the poorest transport properties (mobilities and 
diffusion coefficients for electron and holes), its success as channel material is due to the 
excellent interface property of the Si-SiO  system. SiO  will almost certainly be replaced by 
2 2
high-κ gate dielectric in the near future. Research activity in this area has experienced a boom in 
recent years with many new devices and material systems now proposed. The following sections 
briefly describe the devices explored in this dissertation. 
2.1.1. Nanoscale CMOS (Nano-CMOS) 
  It has been overwhelmingly felt that mixed-signal electronics has been the driving 
force behind modern technological advances in the society. It has penetrated every walk of life 
and has been embedded into all our activities. Whether it is the built-in feature of an alarm clock 
in mobile phones that people wake up to in the morning or the sensor embedded into the 
microwave oven that heats a breakfast; the sleek, handheld personal digital assistant device or 
the laptop that keeps a busy executive on the move; or the latest MP3 player that accompany 
many joggers, everything has that “digital” tinge in it. In short, every accessory or gadget that 
used in daily life is becoming smaller, cheaper, more efficient, and more feature-packed; this is 
what “digital” equipment has come to mean to a general user. Demands for more and more 
features in every device have thus skyrocketed. Consequently, in recent years, there has been a 
phenomenal increase in the demand for low-power and high-performance digital devices. This 
market of digital electronics is driven by the prowess of an immensely versatile, efficient, and 
economical device called the CMOS. CMOS forms the backbone of today's circuits deploying 
very large scale integration (VLSI). 
  The transistor-feature sizes have shrunk dramatically with the technology scaling. With 
the accompanying shrinking of feature size, a paradigm shift in the power profiles of the devices 
1 1 
has occurred. The leakage components of the fundamental CMOS device have changed 
exponentially, and each component of the total leakage has gained in relative importance. Thus, 
a drastic change has occurred in the leakage components of the device, both in the inactive as 
well as the active modes of operation. As the dimensions of the CMOS device reach nanometer 
ranges, dynamic power consumption remains almost unchanged; but leakage power dissipation 
increases significantly and becomes a large portion of the total power dissipation as the 
technology changes. This change has necessitated a critical analysis of the leakage components 
in the nanoscale CMOS VLSI devices and a concomitant need for the exploration of efficient 
reduction techniques of these leakage components, which continues to be dissipated even when a 
device is not doing any useful operation. 
  Scaling of CMOS implies proportional reduction of the geometrical features as well as 
the parametric features (device characteristics) of the CMOS transistor. The idea of scaling 
began with the classical Moore's law, which had a phenomenal impact as a driving force for the 
entire semiconductor industry. CMOS scaling has become a very well-defined practice in the 
semiconductor industry. The design goals for scaling have been well defined for a long time. The 
main three typical goals of classical technology scaling are to 
•  Reduce gate delay by about 30%, which results in an increase in an operating frequency of 
about 43% 
•  Double the transistor density, which results in packing ever more components in the same 
chip (following Moore's law) 
•  Reduce energy per transition by about 65% and thus save 50% of power (at a 43% increase 
in frequency) 
1 2 
  Most of the goals have been maintained over all the years to a great benefit and have 
fueled market demand for portable devices. The scaling of CMOS has always beaten predictions 
and has advanced faster than predicted. The benefits of scaling have been manifold: 
•  Decreasing device size 
•  Increasing chip density and component density 
•  Increasing performance and speed 
•  Decreasing cost 
•  Decreasing supply voltage 
•  Decreasing power requirement 
However, there are some obvious roadblocks that can be credited to scaling: 
•  Tremendous increase in power density in a chip 
•  Issues in reliability and robustness 
•  Ever-increasing mask costs and fabrication issues 
•  Tremendous increase in complexity 
•  Decreasing design flexibility 
•  Random dopant fluctuations 
•  Increasing process variations at nano levels 
•  Increased likelihood of soft errors 
  The channel length of a device represents the technology node that a particular process 
follows. The current industrial processes now are inching down to reach the nanometer level, 
where the channel length is of the order of a fraction of a micron. Industry has already put 45 nm 
node process into production. However, at these nanoscale levels, the channel is much shorter 
than the conventional channel length, and the device characteristics are very much affected by 
1 3 
these shorter channel lengths. A number of adverse effects peculiar to scaling which result in a 
significantly reduced channel length are identified as short channel effects (SCEs). These SCEs 
mostly pertain to the power dissipation or leakage characteristics of the nanoscaled CMOS 
device. There are several forms of leakage currents (figure 2.1) in a short-channel nanometer 
transistor [103]: 
•  I : Drain to source active current (ON state) 
1
•  I : Drain to source short-circuit current (ON state) 
2
•  I : Subthreshold leakage (OFF state) 
3
•  I : Gate oxide tunneling leakage (ON and OFF states) 
4
•  I : Gate current due to hot carrier injection (ON and OFF states) 
5
•  I : Channel punch through current (OFF state) 
6
•  I : Gate-induced drain leakage (GIDL) (OFF state) 
7
•  I : Reverse biased p-n junction leakage (ON and OFF states) 
8

Figure 2.1. Various leakage currents in a nanoscale CMOS transistor. 
  Each power component has several forms and origins as they flow between different 
terminals and in different operating conditions of a transistor, as shown in figure 2.1. These 
1 4 
SCEs, among others, are gaining prominence with the phenomenon of scaling. To overcome 
these SCEs, the ITRS roadmap envisions that high-performance CMOS circuits will require 
ultra-low gate oxide thickness [5]. However, such devices will be susceptible to a more profound 
leakage mechanism because of tunneling through the gate oxide (I ) [29]. Thus, there is a 
gate
critical need for analysis, explanation, and characterization of the various tunneling mechanisms, 
targeted toward design for manufacturing (DFM) and process variation modeling. 
2.1.2. High-κ/Metal Gate 
  Aggressive scaling of SiO  has been going on for the past 15 years for low-power, high-
2
performance CMOS transistor applications [38]. Recently, SiO  with a physical thickness of 1.2 
2
nm was implemented in the 90 nm logic technology node. In addition, research transistors with 
0.8 nm (physical thickness) SiO  have been demonstrated in the laboratory. However, continual 
2
gate oxide scaling will require high-κ gate dielectric (κ being the dielectric constant) since the 
gate oxide leakage in SiO  is increasing with reducing physical thickness and SiO  will 
2 2
eventually run out of atoms for further scaling. The majority of the high-κ gate dielectrics 
investigated are based on hafniun oxide (HfO ) and zirconium oxide (ZrO ) [39]. Metals are 
2 2
being evaluated as the gate electrodes for the high-κ gate dielectrics. The use of high-κ serves the 
dual purpose of scaling the device as well as reducing gate leakage. Hence, high-κ metal gate 
transistors serve as a good alternative to classical CMOS transistors in nanoscale technologies. 
The structure of a high-κ metal gate transistor is shown in figure 2.2. 
1 5 
 
Figure 2.2. Structure of high-κ metal gate transistor. 
2.1.3. Fin FET/Dual-Gate FET 
  General MOSFET at a submicron level is suffering from several submicron issues like 
SCEs and threshold voltage variation. Fin FET is proposed to overcome the SCEs. The silicon-
on-insulator (SOI) process is used to fabricate fin FET. This process ensures the ultrathin 
specifications of the device regions. In fin FET, electrical potential throughout the channel is 
controlled by the gate voltage. This control is possible because of the proximity of the gate 
control electrode to the current conduction path between the source and the drain. These 
characteristics of the fin FET minimize the SCE [105]. Advantages of the fin FET over its bulk-
Si counterpart are as follows: 
•  Conventional MOSET manufacturing processes can also be used to fabricate fin FET 
•  Fin FET provides better area efficiency than MOSFET 
•  Mobility of the carriers can be improved by using the fin FET process in conjunction with 
the strained Si process 
  The silicon on insulator (SOI) process is used to manufacture fin FET. A single 
polysilicon layer is deposited over a fin. Thus polysilicon straddles the fin structure to form 
perfectly aligned gates. Here fin itself acts as a channel and it terminates on both sides of source 
and drain. In general MOSFET device, over the Si substrate poly-Si gate is formed. Poly-Si gate 
1 6 
controls the channel. Straddling of poly-Si gate over the Si fin gives efficient gate-controlled 
characteristics compared to MOSFET. Since gate straddles the fin the length of the channel is 
same as that of width of the fin. As there are two gates effectively around the fin, the width of the 
channel is equivalent to twice the height of the fin; i.e., W = 2 × h. A term called “fin pitch" is 
used to define the space between two fins. The height of the fin FET is equivalent to the width of 
the MOSFET. If W is the fin pitch, then to attain the same area efficiency required, fin height is 
W/2. But practical experiments have shown that fin height can be greater than W/2 for a fin pitch 
of W; thus, fin FET achieves more area efficiency than MOSFET. 
  SOI technology is used for the fabrication of fin FET. In SOI technology, an insulator, 
SiO , isolates the bulk from the substrate. An extremely shallow junction is formed because of 
2
the depth limitation put by the insulator. The dielectric isolation and elimination of the latch-up 
problem are the advantages of the SOI process. In the Fin FET fabrication process, silicon nitride 
(Si N ) and SiO  are deposited on a thin SOI layer. Electron beam lithography is used to form a 
3 4 2
Si fin. Channel length and channel width are determined by the accuracy of the fin. Poly-Si with 
pentavalent impurities and the oxide layer are deposited over the Si fin. The source and drain 
regions are separated and insulator spacers are formed. Then the etching process is carried out on 
a spacer until a Si fin is reached. Gate is formed by depositing the gate layer. Silicidation is 
performed to decrease the high-source drain resistance which is formed because of very thin 
layers of source and drain. The structure of fin FET is shown in figure 2.3. 
1 7

2.1.4. Carbon Nanotube (CNT) 
  Research within the computing industry continues to focus on downscaling the existing 
CMOS architectures. However, several problems arise when CMOS transistor feature sizes drop 
below 45 nm; these problems prevent manufacturers from fabricating improved VLSI designs 
using these nanoscale transistors. On the other hand, CNT devices show either only a fraction of 
these unwanted characteristics or exhibit no degree at all [11]. CNTs can be fabricated in either 
metallic or semiconducting configurations in which the current transport is ballistic, leading to 
carrier mobilities that are much higher than in Si. In addition, the absence of collision scattering 
in the one-dimensional crystalline structure of the CNTs results in current densities well in 
excess that of metals. Given their wire-like structure, CNTs can be used to fabricate transistors 
and interconnects, the two fundamental components of modern microelectronics technology. 
Among the preventative phenomena exhibited by nanoscale MOSFETs are the following: 
• High electric fields 
  As feature sizes shrink to the nanometer level, MOSFETs require a nonlinear decrease 
in the power supply voltage as a function of channel length. The result is an increase in the 
magnitude of electric field across the gate oxide layer, which produces higher leakage 
1 8 
currents at the gate. This leakage current degrades performance and may drive the device into 
avalanche breakdown during which freely conducted electrons produce damaging current levels. 
The nanotube, however, acts as a quasi-one-dimensional path and possesses no called bulk. 
Therefore, power supply voltage can be reduced linearly as a function of channel (or tube) 
length. 
• Threshold voltage 
  Although desirable, reduction of the threshold voltage proportional to the downscale 
of the MOSFET channel is not possible because it is necessary to control the quiescent state 
power consumption. This power consumption is due primarily to leakage current through the 
device, which is mitigated by maintaining a high threshold voltage. The large V , however, 
T
reduces the margins between saturation and cutoff states, and therefore the probability the device 
may enter a linear mode of operation. 
• Interconnect delays 
  Any decrease in wire width leads to an increase in interconnect resistance, thereby 
increasing propagation delay. It turns out that the increase in interconnect delays is large 
compared to the corresponding increase in gate delay. Thus, continued downscaling will yield 
diminishing returns in speed, which may eventually curtail altogether.  
• Gate-oxide layer shrinking 
  At 0.1 µm, CMOS devices require an oxide thickness of at least 3 nm. Such a thin 
oxide layer allows quantum tunneling and hence leakage current through the gate. Decreases in 
the gate oxide layer exacerbate this leakage and render further downscaling impractical. Thus, 
inefficient doping and the onset of quantum mechanical effects hinder CMOS device operation 
when fabricated at nanometer scales. The hardware industry is attempting to work around these 
1 9 
obstacles by engineering devices that compensate for quantum effects. CNTs eliminate these 
concerns and provide a means of meeting future demands for smaller, faster microelectronic 
devices. What remains is to master the CNT FET fabrication techniques and the work required to 
bring these techniques to production level. 
  Thus, we see that CNT is a potential successor for CMOS in nanoscale technologies. The 
research described in this dissertation aimed to explore the design scenario when future, CNT 
will be used to design the circuits at nanometer levels. Figure 2.4 shows the structure of a CNT 
transistor.

2.2. Power Leakage and Delay Models 
  While the aggressive scaling of CMOS technology to ever smaller dimensions has 
enabled higher performance and integration levels, it has given rise to a plethora of new 
problems in the design of ICs. The reason for this rise is that the supply voltage has continually 
scaled down to reduce the dynamic power consumption. As the supply voltage is scaled down, 
the threshold voltage has to be reduced in the same proportion to maintain performance. Reduced 
threshold voltages and gate oxide thicknesses have caused an alarming increase in subthreshold 
2 0 
source-drain leakage and gate leakage power dissipation in both active and standby modes of 
operation. As a result, leakage power has become an increasingly important fraction of the total 
chip power in the current technology generation. In the past, the subthreshold leakage of 
transistors has been very small; but as transistors have been scaled down below the 100 nm node, 
leakage composes nearly 50% of the total power consumption. As threshold voltages are 
reduced, subthreshold leakage rises exponentially. Also at nanoscale technologies, gate-oxide 
leakage is comparable to subthreshold leakage. The subthreshold leakage problem has been 
widely researched in recent years, and several promising circuit techniques have been proposed 
for addressing it [43]. However, in future technology generations, gate leakage is expected to 
grow faster than subthreshold leakage since gate oxide thicknesses are being scaled at a much 
faster rate than supply or threshold voltages [5].  
  Furthermore, gate leakage is a problem when the transistor is in both the on and the off 
states, whereas subthreshold leakage dissipates power only when the transistor is off. In general, 
the requirements for minimizing subthreshold leakage are contradictory to those for reducing 
gate leakage because of their inherently different mechanisms. This contradiction makes the 
problem of total leakage reduction challenging and intriguing as it is necessary to suitably 
mitigate both of these leakage components based on their relative contributions. In the future, it 
is certain that most of the burden of dealing with total leakage reduction will fall to circuit 
techniques.  
  The following subsections explain the power models that are referred for the power-delay 
optimization of circuits used in this dissertation. Design techniques for the reduction of 
leakage power should not affect design performance. Hence, I also considered a delay model. 
2.2.1. Dynamic Power 
2 1 
  The dynamic power consumption of a circuit is given as [99]: 
(1)        P = α×C ×V 2 × f  
dynamic L dd
where the α term is an activity factor that captures how many devices are active on any 
particular clock cycle, C  is the total switched capacitive load, V  is the supply voltage, 
L dd
and f is the frequency of the clock. P  term is derived from the equations for energy 
dynamic
consumed in charging and discharging a capacitor. This power dissipation depends on 
loading condition not the device features. 
2.2.2. Subthreshold Leakage 
  The subthreshold leakage current (I ) through a MOSFET can be modeled as follows 
sub
[1, 72]: 
 −V  V −V −V 
(2)        Isub = I0×1− exp v ds × exp gsS×vT off  
therm therm
where I  is a constant dependent upon device parameters for a given technology, v  is 
0 therm
the thermal voltage, V  is the threshold voltage, V is the offset voltage which determines 
T off  
the channel current at V  = 0, S is the subthreshold swing factor, V is gate-to-source 
gs gs  
voltage, and V  is the drain-to-source voltage. Hence, if T  is increased, the length (L ) 
ds ox eff
is increased and/or the width (W ) of the transistors is reduced, there will be a reduction 
eff
in the subthreshold current. 
2.2.3. Gate-Oxide Leakage 
Gate-oxide leakage in a MOSFET due to direct tunneling can be modeled as follows 
[42, 109]: 
 
2 2 
  3
   V 2
−B1−1− ox  
2  φ 
V    ox 
(3)        JDT = A×Tooxx  ×exp  Vox  
 T 
ox
 
 
where J  is the direct tunneling current density, V  is the potential drop across the thin oxide, 
DT ox
and φ  is the barrier height for the tunneling particle (hole or electron). A and B are physical 
ox
parameters. From this expression, one can see that gate leakage is exponentially dependent on 
variations in T . Hence, if T  is increased, there will be a reduction in the gate oxide leakage 
ox ox
current. 
2.2.4. Total Power Dissipation 
The total power of a circuit (P ) can then be calculated as 
circuit
(4)        P  = P  + P  + P  
circuit dynamic subthreshold gate-oxide
where P , P  and P  can be calculated from equations 1, 2 and 3, respectively. 
dynamic subthreshold gate-oxide
Thus, we conclude that T , V , and the geometry of a transistor play a crucial role in 
ox T
determining the power dissipation of a circuit. 
2.2.5. Delay Model 
The delay of a device is approximately given as [109]: 
 
 
 C ×V 
(5)        Delay =k× L dd  
 
∈  W 
μ× ox × eff ×(V −V )α
 Tox   Leff  dd T 
where k = technology constant, µ is the electron surface mobility and α is the velocity 
saturation index, which varies from 1.4 to 2 for nanometer CMOS. The delay of circuits is 
generally calculated from the 50% level of the input swing to 50% level of the output swing. 
2 3 
2.3. Low-Power Design Techniques 
  As seen in the section 2.1, power dissipation has become the most significant issue for 
consumers as well as designers for the nanoscale CMOS regime. As the demand for more and 
more portable battery-operated devices increases, the issue of low-power VLSI design becomes 
more critical. The reasons that why power becomes an issue can be summarized as follows: 
•  With scaling, new and ever-more obtrusive forms of power leakage become prevalent 
•  Static power consumption becomes as significant as dynamic power, implying that the 
device is dissipating half the power without doing any useful work 
•  High-power dissipation increases the packaging and cooling costs, which are not 
economical even at higher technology nodes 
•  Battery technology, like many other technologies, is not expected to keep pace with the 
scaling 
•  Wasting precious power resources affects the environment 
•  Scaling has resulted in manifold complexity in today's CMOS circuits; this issue, along 
with diverse and profound power leakage makes reliability and robustness of the device a 
prime concern. 
The various low-power techniques can be classified into two categories: 
(1) Structural Techniques 
•  Voltage islands 
•  Multi-threshold (V ) devices 
T
•  Minimized capacitance by custom design 
•  Power-efficient circuits 
•  Parallelism in micro-architecture 
2 4 
(2) Traditional Techniques 
•  Clock gating 
•  Power gating 
•  Variable frequency 
•  Variable voltage supply 
•  Variable device threshold (V ) 
T
The above techniques are also aimed at reducing dynamic power and leakage power: 
(1) Dynamic Power Reduction 
•  Clock gating 
•  Power-efficient circuits 
•  Variable frequency 
•  Variable voltage supply 
(2) Leakage Power Reduction 
•  Minimized usage of low V  cells 
T
•  Power gating 
•  Back-biasing 
•  Reduced dynamic power 
•  Reduced oxide thickness (T ) 
ox
•  Use of fin FETs 
  In this dissertation, I have used the dual-threshold, dual-oxide, and dual-supply 
techniques for power reduction. These techniques are described in detail in the following 
paragraphs. 
 
2 5 
2.3.1. Dual Threshold (Dual V ) 
T
  Foundries typically provide two V  process options: high and low V . Having only two 
T T
options forces the designer to optimize either for performance or power. Designers often use 
different V  transistors for different logic blocks and logic gates within a device. That is, 
T
designers can use a low V , high-leakage transistors for the critical path where performance is a 
T
requirement, and high V  transistors in parts of the chip where performance is not critical. Since 
T
the leakage current is exponentially dependent on the threshold voltage, increasing the threshold 
voltage would decrease the leakage current substantially. However, the high-threshold-voltage 
devices have larger switching delays. The various leakage-current mechanisms and some leakage 
reduction techniques for CMOS circuits have been discussed in [63] and [103]. The techniques 
for reducing leakage power involve static and dynamic approaches. The dynamic approach, 
  The dual V  (DVTCMOS) design technique, which is a static approach, has been widely 
T
used in the custom VLSI designs for reducing leakage power. The DVTCMOS implementation 
reduces both the active and the standby leakages. Further, there is no performance degradation in 
a DVTCMOS implementation for custom VLSI designs. This technique uses two kinds of 
transistors in the same circuit. Some transistors have a high threshold voltage, and other 
transistors have a low threshold voltage. The high-threshold-voltage transistors have less 
subthreshold leakage-power dissipation but also have a larger delay as compared to the low-
threshold-voltage transistors. 
2.3.2. Dual Oxide (Dual T ) 
ox
  Leakage current is a primary concern for low-power, high-performance digital CMOS 
circuits for portable applications, and industry trends show that leakage will be the dominant 
component of power in future technologies. New leakage mechanisms, such as tunneling across 
2 6 
thin gate oxides, which lead to gate oxide leakage current (I ), are coming into play from the 
gate
90 nm node onwards. According to the ITRS, a high-performance CMOS device will require 
gate oxide thicknesses of 0.7 to 1.2 nm, thus leading to gate leakage due to carrier tunneling 
through the ultra thin layer of gate oxide [5]. The probability of electron tunneling is a strong 
function of the barrier height (i.e., the voltage drop across gate oxide) and the barrier thickness, 
which is simply T . A small change in T  can have a tremendous impact on I .  
ox ox gate
  The other component of leakage, subthreshold leakage (I ), forms a reducing fraction of 
sub
the total leakage as T  is reduced, so that I  becomes the dominant leakage mechanism at 
ox gate
nanoscale. The dual oxide technique explores the use of dual T  values for minimizing leakage 
ox
minimization and maintaining performance at the same time. A higher oxide thickness (T ) 
ox-H
leads to increased delay. The dual T  technique involves higher oxide thickness (T ) 
ox ox-H
assignment to transistors in the non-critical path and lower oxide thickness (T ) assignment to 
ox-L
transistors in the critical path. Thus, by using this technique, one can suppress gate oxide leakage 
while maintaining the speed of the circuit. 
2.3.3. Dual Supply (Dual V ) 
dd
  Although a dual V  design helps engineers minimize leakage of their designs, another 
T
technique, dual supply design, helps designers control dynamic power. Similar to dual threshold 
design, dual supply design enables designers to give the critical paths and blocks in their designs 
access to maximum voltage for the process and specification, but the designers then reduce the 
voltage for less power-hungry blocks. For example, a processor block may require a clock speed 
of 500 MHz, but a universal serial bus (USB) core may require only 30 MHz to comply with the 
USB protocol and thus require less voltage to run. So, if designers give the USB core only the 
power it needs, they can drastically reduce the overall power that the design consumes. To 
2 7 
implement the method, designers traditionally put level shifters between blocks that are running 
at different voltages. If there is a 0.9 V region on an IC design that is sending a signal to a 1.2 V 
region, it is necessary to put a level shifter between the two regions so that it is possible to boost 
it to the swing in voltage and control timing. 
  Although a fairly simple concept, its implementation is more complex. First, designers 
must get used to dealing with multiple voltages on a die. There are also some fairly significant 
challenges on the tools front. Most commercial synthesis and physical-design tools can insert 
level shifters and can perform multivoltage, but creating a register transfer level (RTL) is a 
problem. Hardware description languages (HDLs) do not yet have a mechanism for describing 
power connectivity. This lack is one area that electronic design automation (EDA) vendors are 
addressing by trying to implement a low-power standard. 
  Another emerging method that started in custom design but is making its way into 
application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) design is the use of parallelism with voltage 
scaling. Parallelism is done to get the performance up, and then voltage is scaled down to reduce 
the power and energy. If one looks at dynamic power, voltage is clearly where the biggest gains 
will be. Given a timing constraint of 2 ns, for example, one first overachieves the timing 
objective. In particular, parallelism is added to get the critical path down to 1.2 ns. Then, the 
voltage is scaled down to relax back to the 2 ns cycle time achievement is needed. The decrease 
in voltage more than compensates for the increase in area.

CHAPTER 3 
RELATED PRIOR RESEARCH 
  In this chapter, I present a survey of the current literature related to the research presented 
in this dissertation. Section 3.1 and section 3.2 deal with literature on low-power design 
techniques such as dual supply voltage (V ), dual threshold voltage (V ), and dual oxide 
dd T
thickness (T ). Section 3.3 and section 3.4 discuss the current research on process variation and 
ox
parasitic-aware research. This discussion is followed by current literature related to the mixed-
signal circuits discussed in section 3.5. 
3.1. Dual Supply and Dual Threshold 
  The research using the dual V  technique is quite mature, and several approaches have 
dd
been proposed in the literature over the past several years [18, 86, 59]. Certain types of circuitry 
called level converters are used for this purpose. The transistors on critical paths are operated on 
a higher supply voltage (V ), whereas transistors on the non-critical paths are operated on a 
ddh
lower supply voltage (V ) [70, 57]. Dual V  and dual V  designs are becoming increasingly 
ddl dd T
popular because of the rising leakage current levels of ultra-small metal oxide semiconductor 
field effect transistor (MOSFETs) [34, 115]. Decreasing the supply voltage is an effective way of 
reducing power. However, the delay increase that is due to the reduction in supply voltage causes 
reduction in the throughput of the circuit. In order to maintain circuit speed, it is necessary to 
reduce V . This reduction, however, leads to an exponential increase in leakage current. Setting 
T
some of the transistors to high V  and low V  allows maintaining overall performance while 
T dd
reducing leakage current [113, 69, 114]. Multiple threshold CMOS has been used by Pant et al. 
[95] for subthreshold current reduction. Khouri and Jha [64] proposed a dual V  technique for 
T
subthreshold leakage analysis and reduction during behavioral synthesis, targeting the least used 
2 9 
modules as the candidates for leakage optimization. Gopalakrishnan and Katkoori in [51, 52] 
also use the multi-threshold CMOS approach for reduction of subthreshold current during high-
level synthesis and propose binding algorithms for power, delay, and area trade-off. They used a 
clique partitioning approach in [52] and a knapsack-based binding algorithm in [51]. In [35], Liu 
et al. applied probabilistic analysis to V variation. Dual V  design methodology was analyzed in 
T  T
the presence of large variations in threshold voltage. In [7], a dual V  and dual T  technique was 
T ox
applied to static random access memory (SRAM) in order to reduce leakage. In [71], a dual V
T 
field program gate array (FPGA) architecture has been proposed in which the logic elements are 
used for dual V  assignment. In [33], Wei et al. tried to reduce the leakage power by using high 
T 
V  transistors in the non-critical paths and low V  transistors in the critical paths. 
T  T
3.2. Dual Oxide 
  In [90], Mukherjee et al. have proposed a gate oxide leakage minimization approach 
using dual T  and dual K. In [84], Mohanty et al. presented analytical models and a data-path 
ox
scheduling algorithm for reduction of tunneling current. The heuristic assigns higher thickness 
resources to more leaky nodes (multipliers) but does not address the area overhead. In [75], Lee 
et al. developed a method for analyzing gate oxide leakage current in logic gates and suggested 
utilizing pin reordering to reduce gate leakage. In [29], Sultania et al. developed an algorithm to 
optimize the total leakage power by assigning dual T  values to transistors in a given circuit. In 
ox
[112], Sirisantana and Roy used multiple channel lengths and multiple gate oxide thickness for 
reduction of leakage. In [91], Mukhopadhyay et al. have carried out extensive modeling and 
estimation of total leakage current of complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) 
devices considering the effect of parameter variation. In [46], the authors proposed application of 
dual T  technique at circuit level to power-hungry transistors of a given circuit.

3.3. Process Variation 
  As the device technology scales down to nanometer region, intra-die variations such as 
gate oxide thickness (T ) and threshold voltage (V ) variations have become as important as 
ox T
inter-die variation when analyzing circuit performance and predicting the yield of a chip [17, 13, 
14, 117]. With rising concerns of intra-die variation, some of these investigations which modeled 
process variations and performed timing analysis have been proposed [28, 94, 36]. Supply 
voltage (V ) variations also need to be considered during performance estimation.  
dd
  Several research works address process variation in nano-CMOS circuits. In [66], a 
current-controlled oscillator was subjected to process variations. In [83], the authors showed the 
effect of simultaneous variation of supply and process parameters on power consumption of 
data-path components. In [82], the authors developed process variation aware component 
libraries. This work focused on behavioral (high-level) synthesis. An increase in the number of 
variation sources has led to even more corner cases that need to be simulated for each design. In 
[93], the authors have estimated that the 3-σ/µ variation for 65 nm process technology is as high 
as 30% for transistor channel length and transistor threshold voltage. Future processes could 
have even larger amounts of variation. 
3.4. Parasitics 
  Because of the high sensitivity of radiofrequency (RF) integrated circuit (IC) design to 
layout parasitics, a lot of research has been done in the parasitic-aware synthesis area to 
overcome degradations that prevent optimal performance [96, 12] because of device and package 
parasitics. Simulated annealing is proposed for synthesizing RF CMOS circuits in [22, 53, 68, 
77, 20]. Optimization techniques such as particle swarm optimization are proposed for parasitic-
aware design in [23]. In [25], an inductor-capacitor (LC)-based, voltage-controlled oscillator 
3 1 
(VCO) has been subjected to a parasitic-aware synthesis. A parasitic- and process-aware design 
flow has been proposed in [48]. In [67], the center frequency has been optimized using a design 
of experiments approach. A simulation-based circuit synthesis example is presented in [130]. 
3.5. Literature Related to Mixed-Signal Circuits 
  The current literature on mixed-signal circuits is discussed in this section. Four mixed-
signal circuits widely used for various applications in the electronics industry today are 
discussed: 
•  Analog-to-digital converters 
•  Voltage-controlled oscillators 
•  Level converters 
•  Active pixel sensors 
3.5.1. Analog-to-digital Converters 
  Analog-to-digital converter (ADC) design is a bottleneck in system-on-a-chip (SoC) 
design. There is a need for more sophisticated circuitry in terms of speed, area, noise immunity 
and adaptability to the digital process. Recent ADC literature deals with issues of comparator 
offset cancellation [26], using capacitive interpolation to eliminate power-hungry resistive 
ladders [30] or simplifying the comparator design [32]. In [108], an average termination circuit 
was proposed to reduce power consumption. The problem of metastability at high sampling 
speeds was addressed in [119]. The SoC integration problem faced by ADCs has not been given 
sufficient attention. In [127], the authors proposed a solution using the threshold inverting 
technique. In [111], Song et al. proposed an ADC operating at 1 V but the technology is not 
nano-CMOS. Low-voltage ADC designs generally need to use voltage-boosting techniques [6] 
3 2 
or low-threshold processes [41]. The authors in [45] proposed an ADC design at 45 nm, but it is 
not supported with the physical design. 
  Table 3.1 compares the proposed ADC of this dissertation with other ADCs described in 
the current literature. For fair comparison, only 6-bit, flash-type architecture ADCs have been 
chosen. The table shows that the proposed ADC is suitable for nanoscale SoCs; has superior 
integral nonlinearity (INL) and differential nonlinearity (DNL) (expressed in least significant bit 
[LSB]) performance; and is a low-voltage, low-power, high-speed design.

3.5.2. Voltage-controlled Oscillators 
  Analog or mixed-signal designs require accurate frequency or time reference signals. 
Phase-locked loops (PLLs) are used to provide such stable references [16] and one of the 
important components of a PLL is the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) [9]. The VCO 
3 3 
produces the necessary frequency in the PLL used to synchronize with the reference signal and 
increases or decreases its frequency of operation, depending on the increase or decrease in the 
control voltage supplied to it [10]. Most commonly, LC oscillators and ring-type oscillators are 
used for this purpose. In today's generation of nanoscale technology, LC oscillators cannot be 
used because the inductors are quite large and hence cannot be scaled down to the minimal 
dimensions of technology. Ring oscillators, which are realized by using transistors, are more 
suitable for technology scaling, because they have an on-chip area saving advantage [58].  
  Various VCO architectures using the cross-coupled technique on n-type metal oxide 
semiconductor (NMOS) and p-type (PMOS) transistors are given in [27], and their advantages 
and disadvantages are discussed. Tuning of the VCO at a desired frequency is required for fast 
acquisition. The acquisition time increases in proportion to the initial frequency difference and 
the inverse of loop bandwidth [56]. An extended frequency range CMOS monolithic VCO 
design has been presented in [124], where a wide range of frequency can be achieved without 
any preregistered settings by using analog feedback control. A number of PLL and VCO 
designs are presented in [100]. The authors in [74] studied high-performance designs using 
CMOS processes. Low-power VCOs are presented in [73, 101, 89, 79]. Jitter and phase 
noise were studied in [80] and [54]. A tabular comparison of my research with the existing 
literature (table 3.2) reveals the design proposed in this dissertation to be a high-performance 
VCO at nanoscale technology.

3.5.3. Level Converters 
  A comparative perspective of selected related research works on level converters is 
presented in table 3.3. In a multiple supply voltage (MSV) system, it is essential to consider the 
overhead caused by the level converters [102]. MSV implements pipeline flip-flops along with 
level converters at the end of low Vdd clusters [102] to overcome this overhead. The flip-flops, 
combined with level converters, perform the operation of latching and level conversion at the 
same time. Such flip-flops are called level converting flip-flops. In [57], key properties and 
design metrics of a level converter for dual Vdd systems are examined. Traditional level-converter 
circuits, like cross-coupled level converters (CCLC), single-supply diode voltage Limited buffer 
level converters (SSLC), pass transistor half-latches (PHL), and precharged circuits, have been 
studied. Several new level-converting flip-flop circuits are also proposed. These new designs are 
compared to the above-mentioned traditional level converting circuits in terms of level converter 
performance and robustness as well as system-level performance and robustness. The proposed 
level-converting flip-flops exhibit improved energy-delay product values, reduced system-level 
power, and better immunity to supply noise without significant layout area penalties. 
  In [128, 129, 70], and [104], the authors studied a conventional level-converter circuit 
known as dual cascode voltage switch (DCVS). The DCVS circuit is a small circuit consisting of 
a PMOS pair connected back to back, which acts as a differential pair. Each of the above-
referenced papers proposes new level converter designs considering DCVS as a baseline design. 
In [104], a new level-converter circuit based on the keeper transistor concept was proposed. The 
keeper transistor serves as a level restorer in the pass transistor logic [15]. The authors also 
compared the performance of the proposed circuit and the traditional DCVS by calculating the 
delay, power, and energy-delay product.  
3 5 
  Novel asynchronous level-converters were proposed in [70]. The simulation results 
showed that the proposed designs consume 8% to 50% less energy at equivalent or better speeds 
compared to the other designs at 0.13 µm CMOS technology. A new level-converter design 
based on DCVS was presented in [129]. The authors also compared the speed and power 
consumption of their level converter design and DCVS. In [128], a novel circuit called 
symmetrical dual cascode switch (SDCVS) was proposed. The authors addressed the 
contention problem of DCVS and provided a solution for it, stating that the contention problem 
gave rise to increased delay time and power consumption.  
  Two additional NMOS transistors were added to the DCVS design to eliminate the 
contention problem. Two new logic level-converter designs were presented in [65]. The two 
designs are dynamic logic level-converter (DLC) and dynamic logic level-converter for duty 
ratio conversing. These two designs were applied to a 72-Mb double-data-rate (DDR) SRAM, 
which allowed the chip to operate at a low voltage of 1.2 V when the supply voltages were 
around 1.5 V or 1.8 V. The DLC design consisted of a self-resetting dynamic CMOS logic, 
which made it much faster in operation. 
  In [62], a distinct level down converting circuit was proposed. This circuit consisted of a 
differential input pair circuit acting as the level converting circuit. This level-converter provided 
stable operation for low-voltage and high-speed use [62]. The circuits used thin gate-oxide 
MOSFETS, which enabled a faster level conversion. The differential input pair of this level 
converter offered a high immunity against power supply bouncing. In [104], only the issue of 
short-circuit power dissipation was handled. The SDCVS achieved 50% power reduction and 
60% speed increase. However, this reduced short-circuit power dissipation only. The design I 
propose in my dissertation achieves 83% power savings compared to the original baseline 
3 6 
design. For fair comparison of power consumption, I used my baseline design because the other 
designs presented were different in technology as well as functionality. In addition, the proposed 
design achieved 60% delay compared to that reported in existing works [57].

3.5.4. Active Pixel Sensors 
  The scaling of CMOS technologies has accelerated in recent years and will arguably 
continue toward the 10 nm node regime [5]. Advanced circuit design exploration must start 
before future technologies are fully developed in order to solve design challenges posed by 
nanoscale CMOS technology. Particular examples of these emerging challenges include leakage 
current, process variations, and transistor reliability. In [61], the authors examined mismatch in 
photo-detectors at 2 µm and 1.2 µm CMOS processes. In [40], the authors presented results for 
pixel mismatch. In [31, 123], low-voltage APS designs were proposed. The authors in [122] 
presented recent advances in image sensors with device scaling considerations. In [106], the 
authors analyzed the effect of technology scaling on readout time. A multiple-resolution APS 
was presented in [8]. 
  Table 3.4 provides a broad overview of the existing works on APS array. The APS 
I propose in this dissertation has been designed with the smallest CMOS technology, has 
3 7 
the lowest power dissipation, and operates at the lowest supply voltage. Thus, my proposed APS 
is more suitable for target nanoscale SoC applications.

CHAPTER 4 
PROPOSED LOW-POWER DESIGN AND OPTIMIZATION METHODOLOGIES 
  This chapter constitutes the main original contributions of this dissertation. The issue of 
process variation and how it is becoming a major obstacle for nanoscale design is discussed first. 
Next is an explanation of optimization methodologies for power, parasitic-aware and process-
variation-aware designs at nanoscale. 
4.1. Issue of Process Variation 
  Semiconductor designers are facing numerous challenges as they migrate their existing 
designs or start new designs in 90 nm, 65 nm and finer process geometries. Two of the biggest 
challenges are the increasing power specifications because of leakage power and potential yield 
loss caused by increasing process variations. 
  Designing for yield is an afterthought in today's design flows, whether it is digital, 
analog/radiofrequency (RF), or mixed-signal. The lack of design for yield tools has forced the 
digital world to accept overly pessimistic guardbands as the norm. Just as in digital design where 
interconnect delays make or break a design, the move to 90 nm and lower process technologies 
means that the variations in process parameters have a resounding effect on the performance 
metrics of analog/mixed-signal, memory and RF circuits.  
  A digital circuit is typically optimized only for speed and power, whereas an analog 
circuit is designed to meet as many as 5 to 10 performance metrics. As a result, the impact of 
these process variations is seen as design yield loss. A proactive and a deterministic way is 
needed to deal with performance and yield while in the design phase, and not after first silicon. 
Design yield, also known as parametric yield, is a design's sensitivity to process variations. In 
general, designers verify the operation of their circuits at the center point of the process, which is 
3 9 
also called the nominal point. In addition, they verify the operation of their circuits at the typical 
four worst-case “corner” points.  
  The nominal point is not necessarily “the best operating point for that process,” but is 
easiest for fabrication to control. However, the reality is that with the variations that process 
parameters exhibit and the nonlinear nature of analog/RF circuits, the design must operate across 
the entire range of process and operating conditions, not just the nominal and the four worst-case 
points. Current tools analyze and optimize a design only for the nominal point without sweeping 
across the full range of process and operational parameters. A significant part of the loss in yield 
of a design can be attributed to parametric yield, and it is typically on the order of 20%. 
  Simulation and nominal optimization tools analyze a design only for a fixed process point 
(typically the nominal or, supposedly, the worst-case point). They fall short of optimizing true 
parametric yield based on process variations. Yield optimization with built-in sensitivity analysis 
and full knowledge of the distribution of process variations is critical to understanding the factors 
that contribute to parametric yield and to optimizing the design to achieve the maximum yield. 
The impact of the variations in the process parameters and operating conditions of the 
performance factors of a design is much more for nanometer than the sub-micron technologies. 
Hence, the nominal operating point, which is the center of the distribution of the parameters for a 
given process, may not be the best operating point for design yield.  
  What is really needed is an automated way to maximize design yield such that the design 
operates as specified across the entire process and operating environment. When an analog/ 
mixed-signal or memory design is optimized for multiple performance parameters, the worst-
case condition may be different for each performance parameter such as gain, bandwidth, and 
jitter [54]. Trying to simultaneously optimize a design for each such performance parameter can 
4 0 
be a nightmare and is typically beyond what an individual can assimilate. Furthermore, net yield 
is determined by the design simultaneously meeting all those requirements. 
  It is common to address design yield problems after a design is manufactured. Engineers 
will track a low-yielding wafer to see what process variations cause the yield loss. Then, they 
will run simulations to see where the design should be tweaked to improve yield. This "redesign 
by autopsy" approach to addressing design yield issues is very costly compared to handling 
design yield at the front end of the design process using design for yield (DFY) techniques. Use 
of DFY techniques in the front end design process will accelerate the design flow and get the 
final product to market faster and with higher yield. 
  The following sections describe methodologies used in this dissertation for attacking 
this problem of yield caused by process variations and achieving low-power designs at the same 
time. These methodologies have been tested on specific analog/mixed-signal circuits (discussed I 
n chapter 5) in order to verify their effectiveness. 
4.2. Single-Iteration Automatic Approach 
  The primary purpose of this approach is to address the issues of parasitic degradation and 
process variation in integrated circuits (ICs). To achieve parasitic closure, multiple iterations 
between the front-end circuit design and back-end layout will be required, according to the 
standard IC design flow in figure 4.1 [120]. In this figure, I have indicated the manual and 
automatic processes separately. I assume that the manual process requires X number of 
iterations. The primary purpose of the proposed design flow, called parasitic-aware design flow, 
is to reduce the number of manual iterations to 1 by performing the X number of iterations on 
a parasitic parameterized netlist instead of the layout. The parasitic parameterized netlist refers to 
the netlist derived from the initial physical design and then parameterized. This netlist gives the 
4 1 
designer a fair idea of the parasitics present in the designed circuit. The final optimal physical 
design is carried out after optimization and constitutes 1 iteration. 
 
Figure 4.1. Standard IC design flow. 
  Hence, I reduced the X number of manual iterations required for parasitic closure to 1 
manual iteration. The proposed design flow is shown in figure 4.2. The optimized physical 
design was then tested, and the results are presented in figure 6.4. The discrepancy in the 
oscillation frequency of the logical and physical design of the voltage controlled oscillator 
(VCO) has been reduced to 1% in a single physical design iteration. More details are given in 
section 6.2.1. To have a process variation robust design, I also introduced a process variation 
analysis step in the parasitic-aware design flow to formulate a new design flow called parasitic- 
4 2 
and process-variation-aware design flow. In this cycle, the parasitic parameterized netlist was 
subjected to worst-case process variations. 
 
Figure 4.2. Proposed parasitic-aware IC design flow. 
  The final physical design was carried out with the optimized parameters obtained from 
the netlist optimized for a worst case process variation environment constituting 1 iteration. A 
nano-complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) VCO has been subjected to this 
methodology; the results are presented in chapter 6. This procedure (shown in figure 4.3) ensures 
that the resulting final physical design is not only resistant to parasitic effects but is also tolerant 
4 3 
to process variations. These are novel methodologies for physical design of nano-CMOS RF 
components to meet the required design specifications. In both procedures, a 1-iteration approach 
(see algorithm 1) is followed, in which the layout has to be done only twice, once before the 
optimization and once after the optimization. In this communication, the fully extracted physical 
design consisting of resistors (R), capacitors (C), inductors (L) and mutual inductors (K) is 
optimized to meet the target specification.

  Algorithm 1 presents the optimization used in the single-iteration approach. The inputs to 
the algorithm consist of the parasitic parameterized netlist, the objective set F with its stopping 
criterion S (which is the specification required for successful design closure), and the design 
variable set D with its lower constraint Clower and upper design constraint Cupper. The outputs of 
the algorithm are the optimized objective set Foptimized within the specifications and the 
4 5 
corresponding optimal values of the design variable set Doptimal. First, a simulation is run using 
the initial values of D, and the value of F is calculated to determine whether the initial values are 
feasible for the given Foptimized  (which are the specifications for the design as shown in figure 
4.3). In the next iteration, the design variable set (D) values are changed by using conjugate 
gradient method, to achieve the required Foptimized. The circuit is simulated again by using this 
new design variable set. This process continues until F meets the stopping criterion S. 
4.3. Hybrid Monte Carlo and Design of Experiments (DOE) Approach 
  The general convention used to determine a given circuit's yield is Monte-Carlo analysis: 
A large number of parameter sets is generated, using a normal distribution with the process 
standard deviations (presumed to be known); and the number of samples within specifications is 
determined. A DOE is used to determine the influence of variation of fabrication parameters on 
measurable quantities. The advantage is that only a very limited amount of experiments needs to 
be performed from which a maximum amount of information must be gained. In general, a fit of 
the data is performed with the measured data points. This fit can then be used to find optimal 
working points or to determine the expected yield of a process. Thus, while a Monte Carlo 
approach gives a designer an idea about the circuit's yield, a DOE approach allows the designer 
to reduce the number of required simulations dramatically while providing a near-optimal 
design. A novel algorithm for optimization of any given circuit is discussed in Algorithm 2. The 
proposed algorithm takes advantages of both the strengths of Monte Carlo analysis and DOE.

  The presented optimization algorithm is very suitable for power-aware design of circuits 
while being subjected to process variation. The inputs to the algorithm are the baseline circuit, 
the objective set F, which may be power and delay for a given circuit; and the design variable set 
D, which consists of quantities under the designer's control (for example, the widths of 
transistors and supply voltage). The output of the algorithm is a circuit, which gives the 
4 7 
optimized values of F (F ), and the values of the design variable set, which give this 
optimized
optimized circuit (Doptimal).  
  The first stage of the algorithm involves Monte Carlo data collection. In this stage, for 
each corner of the design variable set D, N Monte Carlo runs consider process variation or 
mismatch or both, depending on the designer's requirement. The data for F is recorded and 
normalized, from which the mean (µF) and standard deviation (σF) are calculated. Thus, µF  and 
σ   are obtained for each corner of the design variable set D in the Monte Carlo data collection 
F
stage.  
  The next stage is the DOE. Using DOE, I obtained prediction equations for µF  and σF, 
called µ^F  and σ^F, which show the dependence of F on the design variable set D. This was 
followed by formation of the objective function fF . If F is the power of the circuit under 
consideration, optimization would refer to power minimization. Hence, the objective function: 
(6)           f  = µ^  + 3 × σ^  
F F F
where fF  has to be minimum. Once the objective function was formed (equation 6), I computed 
fF  for all the design corners of D, and the acceptable value was chosen. For example, if power is 
considered, then the minimum value will be acceptable. The design corner, which gave this 
acceptable value, is called Doptimal. Using this Doptimal, the circuit was simulated; and the 
corresponding value of F, i.e., Foptimized, was obtained. Hence an optimized circuit was obtained. 
This approach has been used to optimize an 8 × 8 APS array (presented in chapter 6). Figure 4.4 
shows the theory behind the formation of the objective functions. The idea is that µbaseline of the 
figure of merit to be optimized needs to be shifted left or right, depending on whether it needs to 
be minimized (µminimized) or maximized (µmaximized). The 3 × σbaseline of the figure of merit (which is 
4 8 
a measure of the spread) also needs to be minimized to 3 x σminimized. A 3 × σ limit has been 
considered, so that 99.5% of all the figure-of-merit values will fall within the 3 × σ limit.

4.4. Corner-based Methodology 
  For robust designs, the influence of process variations has to be considered during circuit 
simulation. I propose a corner-based method that covers the process spread with a minimum 
number of simulation runs. This methodology may be applied to process (say, threshold voltage 
Vt) as well as design parameters (Vdd) while testing a circuit's robustness against process 
variations. Consider two parameters in a given circuit: 
•  Vtn: NMOS transistor threshold voltage. 
•  Vtp: PMOS transistor threshold voltage. 
During CMOS fabrication, threshold voltage implantation for p-type metal oxide semiconductors 
(PMOS) and n-type metal oxide semiconductors (NMOS) are separate steps; hence these two 
parameters are considered independent of each other. Thus for simulating intra-die variations or 
mismatch of, say, ± 5%, between these two parameters, there are four process corners: 
4 9 
•  Corner 1: Vtn  −5%, Vtp  −5% 
•  Corner 2: Vtn −5%, Vtp +5% 
•  Corner 3: Vtn +5%, Vtp −5% 
•  Corner 4: Vtn +5%, Vtp +5% 
  Using these four process corners, I simulated the design and measured the figure of merit 
under consideration. A satisfactory value of the figure of merit obtained gave an indication of 
whether the design was process-variation-tolerant or not. A 90 nm ADC was subjected to such a 
technique. The results are presented in chapter 6. This method might not be as accurate as 
traditional Monte-Carlo simulations, which are very time-consuming, but it is very useful in 
getting a quick estimate of the impact of process variation on a circuit's behavior. Figure 4.5 
depicts this method.

CHAPTER 5 
CASE STUDIES USING SAMPLE DIGITAL,  
ANALOG AND MIXED-SIGNAL CIRCUITS 
  In this chapter, I present the logical and physical designs of specific mixed-signal 
circuits, which have been used as case studies for this dissertation. These circuits are used by the 
industry for a variety of applications such as radiofrequency (RF), wireless, and cell phones. The 
post-layout functional simulation results of each of these circuits are also presented. The design 
of the following circuits is presented: 
•  90 nm/45 nm analog-to-digital converter (ADC) 
•  90 nm voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) 
•  90 nm universal voltage level converter (ULC) 
•  32 nm active pixel sensor (APS) 
5.1. Analog-to-digital Converter (ADC) 
  Figure 5.1 shows the high-level representation of the 6-bit ADC [126], followed by a 
detailed block diagram of a flash ADC 5.2. To achieve a high sampling rate, a flash architecture 
is chosen. The input to the ADC is analog voltage, and the output is in the form of digital codes. 
An n-bit ADC requires 2n − 1 comparators which are contained in the comparator bank. The 
comparator bank outputs a thermometer code. The position of the meniscus (the 1-0 transition) 
represents the analog input and is determined by the thermometer decode circuit, which consists 
of “1 of n" code generators. The “1 of n” code generators generate a “1 of n” code which is 
converted to binary code using the NOR read-only memory (ROM). Hence, the output of the 
ADC is in the form of 6-bit binary code. 
5 1

Figure 5.2. Detailed block diagram of the flash ADC. 
5.1.1. Comparator Design 
  The comparators in the proposed flash ADC are designed by using the threshold inverting 
(TI) technique [60, 76]. The TI comparator has the advantage of high speed and simplicity [76] 
and eliminates the need for inherently complex high-gain differential input voltage comparators 
and additional resistor ladder circuit [116]. The TI comparator sets its switching threshold 
voltage V  internally as the built-in reference voltage, based on its transistor sizes. The 
switching
comparators in a conventional flash ADC are identical in size. In the TI-based ADC, all 
comparators have unique sizes. An n-bit ADC requires 2n − 1 different comparators, each 
comparator having a different V  value. Hence, a total of 63 comparators for a 6-bit ADC, 
switching
each comparator having a different size of transistors, is required. The switching voltage is 
generally calculated by using the following expression [99]: 
5 2 
 μ ×W ( ) 
 pmos pmos × V −V +V 
 μ ×W dd tpmos tnmos 
(7)       V = nmos nmos 

 
nmos nmos
where W  = p-type metal oxide semiconductor (PMOS) width, W  = n-type metal oxide 
pmos nmos
semiconductor (NMOS) width, V  = supply voltage, V  = NMOS threshold voltage, V  = 
dd tnmos tpmos
PMOS threshold voltage, µ  = electron mobility, and µ  = hole mobility, assuming that the 
nmos pmos
PMOS length (L ) = NMOS length (L ). However, short-channel devices do not follow the 
pmos nmos
square-law model used in deriving equation 7. A more suitable expression to determine the 
V  for short-channel devices is given by [10]: 
switching
 
R
(8)        V =V × nmos  
switching dd R +R 
 nmos pmos 
where R and R  are the effective switching resistances for short-channel NMOS and 
nmos  pmos
PMOS transistors, respectively. Since the switching resistance of a transistor depends on the 
width (W) of the transistor, we have varied the width of the PMOS (W ) transistor in the TI 
pmos
comparator in order to achieve the 63 different switching voltages. Another reason for varying 
the width is that the channel length (L) of the transistor more effectively controls the 
performance (frequency ∝ 1 = L2). Hence, L is kept constant throughout the design and only W is 
varied. In the design process, a good input voltage is determined with the following equation: 
(9)        Input voltage range = V  = (V  + V ) 
dd tnmos tpmos
I chose the input voltage range to vary from 493 mV (V ) to 557 mV (V ). The least-
start end
significant bit (LSB) value V is calculated as: 
LSB 
input voltage range V −V 
(10)        V = = end start  
LSB  2n   2n 
5 3 
The V  value is calculated to be 1 mV for the design process. The V  signifies the minimum 
LSB LSB
step that the ADC can distinguish. The sizes of NMOS transistors in the comparator were kept 
constant at 240 nm/120 nm (W /L ). For determining the sizes of PMOS transistors, we 
nmos nmos
used a DC parametric sweep using an analog simulator, where the input DC voltage was varied 
from 0 to 1.2 V in steps of 1 mV. During this simulation, L  was kept at 120 nm while W  
pmos pmos
was varied from 240 nm (W  = W ) to 448 nm (in steps of 1 nm) in order to obtain 63 linear 
pmos nmos
quantization voltage levels. The TI comparator consists of four cascaded inverters, as shown in 
figure 5.3. Inverters 1 and 2 form the baseline comparator, while inverter 3 and 4 provide 
increased gain and sharper switching. 
 
Figure 5.3. Threshold inverter (TI) comparator. (In this figure, W /L  = W /L , which 
pmos pmos nmos nmos
is the starting point for quantization.) 
 
5.1.2. 1 of n Code Generator Design 
  The output of the comparator bank is a thermometer code. This thermometer code is 
converted to a “1 of n" code using “1 of n” code generators. A single slice of “1 of n” code 
5 4 
generator consists of AND gates as combinations of an inverter followed by a NAND gate. The 
output from each of the AND gates is fed to the input of the NOR ROM. One of the two inputs to 
the AND gate is fed from the TI comparator output [24]. The other input to the AND gate is the 
inverted output from the next-level comparator as shown in figure 5.4.  
 
Figure 5.4. Complete circuit diagram for a 3-bit flash ADC shown for brevity. (A similar 6-bit 
structure has been implemented in this paper.) 
 
5.1.3. NOR ROM Design 
  The input to the NOR ROM is a “1 of n” code. The NOR ROM converts this “1 of n” 
code to a binary code. Basically, the NOR ROM maps the n-bit address input onto arbitrary 
values of m-bit data output consisting of a grid of word lines (the address input) and bit lines (the 
5 5 
data output), selectively joined together with transistor switches. It can represent an arbitrary 
look-up table with a regular physical layout. As there are 63-word lines and 6-bit lines, I have 
designed a 63 × 6 NOR ROM. The NOR ROM consists of PMOS pull-up and NMOS pull-down 
devices. The PMOS and NMOS sizes have been taken as 135 nm/180 nm and 180 nm/180 nm, 
respectively. The design decision of W  < W  has been taken to obtain a good voltage 
pmos nmos
swing at the output so that the pull-up device (PMOS) is narrow enough for the pull-down 
devices (NMOS) to pull the output down safely [99]. Finally, buffers are applied at the outputs to 
obtain symmetrical waveforms with equalized rise and fall times. The buffer consists of two 
cascaded inverters having NMOS sizes of 240 nm/120 nm and PMOS sizes of 480 nm/120 nm. 
5.1.4. Physical Design and Characterization of ADC 
  The physical design of the ADC has been carried out with a generic 90 nm salicide 
“1.2V/2.5V 1 Poly 9 Metal” process design kit. A digital CMOS process has been used for the 
physical design, demonstrating the system-on-a-chip (SoC) readiness of the ADC. The three 
major blocks of the flash ADC (the comparator bank, the “1 of n” code generator and the NOR 
ROM) have been laid out column-wise in figure 5.5. The post-layout simulation results are 
presented in subsequent sections. Power and ground routing consist of wide vertical bars, as can 
be seen from the layout, giving minimal electromigration risk and current-resistance (IR) drop. 
Generous use of contacts to the power and ground buses also ensures the small IR drop. 
 
Figure 5.5. Complete layout of the 90 nm ADC. 
5 6 
5.1.4.1. Post-Layout Functional Simulation 
  Figure 5.6 shows the functional simulation of the ADC obtained from the post-layout 
simulation. The ADC is subjected to a transient analysis, where a linearly varying ramp covering 
the full-scale range of the ADC is given as input. Output digital codes from 0 to 63 are obtained 
correctly, with no missing codes. A maximum sampling speed of 1 GS/s can be observed in 
figure 5.6. The least significant bit (out 0) toggles the fastest, as expected. Successive bits toggle 
at half the frequency of the previous one. All 64 codes of the ADC are covered as the input ramp 
traverses the full-scale range.  
 
Figure 5.6. Functional simulation of the 6-bit ADC operating at 1 GS/s. 
 
  The ADC has been characterized for static and dynamic performance. The INL and DNL 
tests have been performed with nominal supply and threshold voltages to confirm satisfactory 
results before process and supply variation are introduced. The signal-to-noise and distortion 
ratio (SNDR) has been measured for dynamic performance. In addition, power consumption of 
the designed circuit has been analyzed. 
5 7 
5.1.4.2. Static Characterization 
  The histogram test is commonly used for linear characterization of the ADC [2]. The 
proposed 6-bit ADC's integral nonlinearity (INL) and differential nonlinearity (DNL) have been 
measured using the histogram method. A mixed-signal simulation environment is set up, where 
INL and DNL calculating blocks are Verilog-A modules. The Verilog-A block generates a 
voltage “vout,” which is sequentially set to 4096 equally spaced voltages between V  and V , 
start end
which is the input voltage range for ADC conversion (section 5.1.1). At each different value of 
vout, a clock pulse is generated causing the ADC to convert this vout value. The resultant code 
of each conversion is stored. When all the conversions have been performed, the INL and DNL 
are calculated from the recorded data as follows: 
(11)        INL[i] = width[i] + INL[I – 1] – 1 
(12)        DNL[i] = width[i] – 1 
[]
1.0×bucket i
[]
(13)        widthi =  
( )

CODES
where bucket holds the number of code hits for each code, and width holds the code width 
calculations. The total hits between codes 1 and 62 are denoted as hits. NUM  is the number 
CODES
of codes (64 for a 6-bit ADC). The maximum INL obtained is 0.344 LSB and the maximum 
DNL is 0.459 LSB. Figures 5.7 and 5.8 show the INL and DNL plots, respectively. Low 
distortion requires an ADC with a low INL. A DNL < 1 LSB also ensures a monotonic transfer 
function for the ADC.  
5 8

Figure 5.8. DNL plot of the ADC.

5.1.4.3. Dynamic Characterization 
  SNDR is a good indicator of the overall dynamic performance of the ADC because it 
includes all the components which make up noise and distortion. The SNDR of an ADC is given 
by the following equation [3]: 
 A 
(14)        SNDR =20×log  RMS,signal  
10 ARMS,noise+harmonics 
The fast fourier transformation (FFT) test was used to measure the SNDR. A 1 MHz sinusoidal 
input was fed to the ADC, and the FFT of the output was obtained. The SNDR was calculated 
from this FFT plot (shown in figure 5.9). The SNDR was found to be 31.7 dB. 
 
Figure 5.9. FFT plot of the ADC at a sinusoidal input frequency f  of 1 MHz for SNDR 
in
calculation. 
 
5.1.4.4. Power Analysis 
  Power analysis of the ADC was performed with a capacitive load of 100 fF, which is a 
reasonable load for a 90 nm CMOS technology [87]. The ADC consumes a peak power of 5.794 
6 0 
milliwatts (mW) and an average power of 3.875 mW, which satisfies the lower bound on power 
consumption [118]. The component-wise power consumption is shown in Table 5.1.  
Table 5.1. Componentwise Power Consumption of ADC 
Component  Average Power (mW) 
Comparator bank  3.68125 (95%) 
NOR ROM  0.155 (4%) 
 
  It can be seen that the comparator bank consumes maximum power. A power-saving 
scheme can be used to turn off the unused TI comparators. The instantaneous power plot of the 
ADC, shown in figure 5.10, has a parabolic nature with peak power at the middle of the 
conversion process because most of the comparators are turned on at the middle voltage, (input 
voltage range)/2. The summary of the measured performance of the ADC is shown in table 5.2.

5.1.5. Transistor-Level Design and Characterization of the ADC at 45 nm Technology 
  The proposed ADC has also been built and characterized at 45 nm technology [45]. The 
block diagram of the ADC remains the same as described earlier in section 5.1.1. But the device 
sizes and the supply voltage change according to the technology used. The simulation and 
characterization details of ADC at 45 nm technology are discussed in this section. Simulated 
with the 45 nm predictive technology model, the results demonstrate INL < 0.5 LSB, DNL < 0.8 
LSB and an SNDR of 31.9 dB. The TI technique is used with W /W  < 1 for many 
pmos nmos
transistors in order to keep the power consumption as low as possible. It is also observed that the 
ADC consumes 45.42 µW of peak power and 8.8 µW of average power while it operates on a 
power supply voltage of 0.7 V. Because the process design kit for 45 nm technology is 
unavailable, the physical design has not been presented. The transistor level design at 45 nm is 
the same as at 90 nm technology. However, the transistor sizes are different. The differences are 
highlighted in the following subsections.  
5.1.5.1. Comparator Design 
  The methodology followed for choosing the comparator sizes was the same as for 90 nm 
technology. However, a suitable power supply of 0.7 V for 45 nm design [5] has been chosen. 
The channel length of transistors has been reduced accordingly. Using equation 9, the input 
voltage range was chosen to vary from 296.3 mV (V ) to 328.3 mV (V ). The V  value is 
start end LSB
calculated to be 500 µV (equation 10). Here, W  = L  = 90 nm/90 nm and L  = 90 nm 
nmos nmos pmos
was kept constant throughout the design, while W  was varied from 51 nm to 163 nm, to get 
pmos
64 quantization levels, 500 µV apart. The results are presented in table 5.3.

  The basic structure of NOR ROM remains the same as the 90 nm design. However, at 45 
nm, W /L  = 75 nm/90 nm and W /L  = 90 nm/90 nm have been used.

5.1.5.3. Functional Simulation 
  An instantaneous plot of the functional simulation of the ADC is shown in figure 5.11. 
Output codes from 0 to 63 are obtained with no missing codes. In this design, a maximum 
sampling speed of 100 MS/s has been obtained. This speed is sufficient as far as video 
applications are concerned [37].

5.1.5.4. Characterization 
  The ADC has been characterized for INL, DNL, and SNDR. The peak and average 
power consumption have also been evaluated. The histogram method was used to calculate INL 
and DNL. The INL and DNL plots of the ADC are shown in figures 5.12 and 5.13, respectively. 
The ADC is observed to have maximum INL = 0.46 LSB and maximum DNL = 0.7 LSB. The 
FFT test was used to measure the SNDR. The SNDR plot of the ADC is shown in figure 5.14. 
The ADC is observed to have an SNDR = 31.9 dB for a 1 MHz sinusoidal input.

5.2. Voltage-controlled Oscillator (VCO) 
  I have considered the current starved type of VCO, as other designs require large resistors 
and capacitors consuming a large silicon area. The design, as shown in figure 5.16, consists of 
two input stage transistors with high impedance, an odd numbered chain of inverters and two 
current source transistors per inverter. The current starved transistors limit the current flow to the 
inverter; i.e., they are starved for current. For determination of the oscillation frequency, we 
calculate the total capacitance (C ) on the drain of the inverter.

then given by:

  The operating frequency of the VCO, f , can be determined by using this simple

capacitance charging estimate (equation 17) [10], where V  is the supply voltage, I  is the

current flowing through the inverter, and N is the odd number of inverters in the VCO circuit. 
Hence, the oscillation frequency is determined by the number of inverters, size of the transistors 
in the circuit, and the current flowing through the inverter (I ), which is determined by the input 
D
voltage to the VCO. 
  The oscillation frequency is the functional specification for the design. The target 
oscillation frequency is kept at a minimum of 2 GHz for this design. To meet high-frequency 
requirements and an area optimal design, the number of stages (N) is fixed to 13. Minimum-sized 
transistors have been used to design the inverters. The length is kept constant for all devices. 
Hence, L  = L  = 100 nm, W  = 250 nm and W  = 2 × W  = 500 nm. Choosing minimum-width

transistors also ensures an area optimal design. The C  is calculated using these values. The I

successful operation are obtained by using equations 15 and 18. However, it is extremely 
7 0 
difficult to find the optimum design by minimizing the phase noise and maximizing the tuning 
range simultaneously. To maximize the tuning range, it is necessary to minimize the parasitic 
capacitances and hence reduce the size of transistors. If the size becomes too small, however, 
flicker noise can dominate, which in turn would increase phase noise. The parasitic inductors 
(considered in this design) also exhibit nonlinear dependence on frequency, which makes the 
complexity of the problem worse.

of the level-up and level-down converters are discussed separately. The area optimal design is 
then presented, followed by the power-delay optimal design.

The circuit has been designed with built-in programmability, and the number of transistors 
required to implement the circuit has been optimized. For circuit optimization, instead of using 
one 4:1 multiplexer or three 2:1 multiplexers, functionality is achieved by using two 2:1 
multiplexers, thus saving on area overhead and resulting in lower power consumption, because 
of reduced transistor count. 
5.3.1.1. Level-up Conversion Circuit 
  The level-up converter is responsible for conversion of a signal at lower voltage (V ) 
ddl
level to a higher voltage (V ). I used a cross coupled level converting circuit (CCLC) (figure 
ddh
19) to achieve the up conversion functionality.  
 
Figure 5.19. Circuit used for pass/block. 
  The CCLC circuit is an asynchronous level converter, which can be inserted anywhere in 
the circuit wherever level conversion is necessary. Because of this flexibility, CCLC is one of the 
designs most commonly used to suppress the direct current (DC) [57]. In this circuit, there are 
two cross-coupled PMOS transistors to form the circuit load. They act as a differential pair [57]. 
Thus, when the output at one side is pulled low, the opposite PMOS transistor will be turned on. 
The output on that side will be pulled high. Below the PMOS load, there are two NMOS 
transistors that are controlled by the input signal V . The NMOS transistors operate with a 
in
7 3 
reduced overdrive V  - V , compared to the PMOS devices. They must be larger to be able to 
ddl T
overpower the positive feedback [99]. The functional simulation result of the level-up converter 
5.3.1.2. Level-down Converter 
  The level-down converter is responsible for converting the high voltage (V ) input 
ddh
signal to a lower voltage level (V ). A differential pair level converter which acts as a level-
ddl
down converter circuit, is used for achieving the functionality of level-down conversion. Such a 
type of level converter finds applications in high-speed digital signal processing (DSP) chips 
[62] and low-voltage devices. It has high noise immunity against supply voltage bouncing [107]. 
The high noise immunity for a level converter circuit is very helpful because noise in the circuit 
is not considered when scaling down V  for low-power design [62]. This has impact on the 
dd
7 4 
output quality of overall system. The circuit diagram for the differential input level-down 
converter is shown in figure 5.21.  
  The circuit runs at a dual voltage that consists of V  and V . The circuit consists of a 
ddh ddl
cross-coupled PMOS pair, similar to the level-up converter circuit. The lower voltage signal, 
V , is applied at an inverter operating at V . The higher level of the signal is converted to a 
ddl ddh
lower level at the output side. The functional simulation result of the level-down converter is 
shown in figure 5.22. 
5.3.1.3. Pass/Block Circuit 
  This is another stage of circuit optimization. To minimize the transistor count of the 
circuit, I used the same circuit for passing and blocking with a control signal used for 
determining the functionality. The circuit diagram for the pass/block circuit is shown in figure 
5.23. The pass/block circuit uses a transmission gate and an inverter to achieve the functionality 
of passing and blocking.  
 
Figure 5.23. Transistor-level realization of the baseline design of the ULC with 32 transistors. 
  When the control signal = 0, it behaves as a pass circuit. When the control signal = 1, it 
behaves as a block circuit, as shown in figure 5.24.  
7 6 
control signal = 1, it behaves as a block circuit. The bottom curve is input, and the top curve is 
output.) 
 
  The blocking functionality completely stops any kind of signal at the input side from 
appearing at the other side. This feature is very important when total isolation from the input 
signal is required for reduction of standby leakage power. Transmission gates are specifically 
used to build the pass/block circuit because of its ability to pass strong 0 or strong 1. This type of 
circuit is very handy when designing a data path or multiplexers. 
5.3.1.4. Baseline ULC Circuit 
  Figure 5.25 shows the transistor level circuit design of the ULC.  
7 7 
 
Figure 5.25. Transistor-level realization of the baseline design of the ULC with 32 transistors. 
  This design is achieved by stitching the individual subcircuits performing step-up 
conversion, step-down conversion, passing, and blocking. To achieve programmability, 
multiplexers are used. For circuit optimization, instead of using a 4:1 multiplexer, I achieved the 
functionality by using three 2:1 multiplexers. The average power consumption of the baseline 
design is 97.83 µW (from simulation program with integrated circuit emphasis (SPICE) 
simulations). 
5.3.1.5. Area Optimal Design 
  To achieve the area optimal design of the ULC, I reduced the functionality of the ULC. 
Because pass function is not generally required, I removed the pass functionality. The design is 
shown in figure 5.26.

transistors, which are subjected to a dual T  technique for power minimization, are highlighted.)

Figure 5.27. Functional simulation of the area optimal ULC. (This waveform verifies the truth 
table given in table 5.6. The sequence of operations is block, step-down, and step-up.) 
 
  In this design, a switch constructed using transmission gates is attached in front of the up 
level converter and down level converter. The output of the level converters can be controlled by 
the switches. I obtained an area optimal design by using two output nodes instead of one node. 
The number of transistors was also reduced to 24, eliminating 8 transistors from the baseline 
7 9 
design by using two 2:1 multiplexers instead of three 2:1 multiplexers. The functional simulation 
of the proposed ULC is shown in figure 5.27.  
  Hence, the area optimal design is capable of performing blocking, level-up conversion 
and level-down conversion. The above subcircuits, as well as the overall ULC circuit, are 
thoroughly tested for functionality. Then, they are exhaustively characterized through 
parametric, load, and power analysis.  
5.3.1.6. Physical Design for 90 nm Technology 
  The physical design of the ULC has been performed using a generic 90 nm salicide 1.2 
V/2.5 V 1P 9M process design kit. In this layout, it was necessary to supply both V  and V  to 
ddh ddl
the cell. The two supply rails (V  and V ) travel side by side to provide the two voltages to the 
ddl ddh
cell. Such a layout does not comply with the conventional application specific integrated circuits 
(ASIC) standard-cell power routing but is more robust [57]. The post-parasitic re-simulations 
matched with the schematic-level simulations. To improve the functional yield and reliability of 
the physical design, I followed design for manufacturability (DFM) methodologies. The use of 
additional vias has been made in the design wherever possible to make it more fault-tolerant 
[55]. The metal lines have been spread out wherever possible to control the capacitance and 
crosstalk between them [46]. 
5.4. Active Pixel Sensor (APS) 
  An APS is an image sensor consisting of an IC containing an array of pixel sensors, each 
pixel containing a photodetector and an active amplifier. There are many types of active pixel 
sensors, including the complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) APS used most 
commonly in cell-phone cameras, web cameras, and some digital single-lens reflex cameras 
(DSLRs). Such an image sensor is produced by a CMOS process (and is hence also known as a 
8 0 
CMOS sensor) and has emerged as an alternative to charge-coupled device (CCD) imager 
sensors. The design of a three-transistor single pixel is presented as shown in figure 5.28 [50].  
 
Figure 5.28. Circuit diagram of an APS. 
  The three transistors of the circuit are as follows: (i) M1: reset transistor, (ii) M2: source 
follower transistor, and (iii) M3: access transistor. A PMOS transistor (M1) has been used as the 
reset transistor because it results in a higher output voltage swing as compared to a conventional 
APS [31]. Transistor sizes are chosen carefully for enough current, source follower gain, and 
isolation of source follower output from the pixel output. In addition, the transistor sizes should 
be as small as possible for the maximum photodiode/pixel ratio (“fill factor"), when considering 
the physical design in silicon. Table 5.6 shows the sizes chosen for the transistors of the APS. 
Table 5.6. Transistor Sizes 
Transistor Name  Size (W:L for 32 nm CMOS) 
M1  160 nm : 32 nm 
M2  320 nm : 32 nm 
M3  240 nm : 32 nm 
8 1 
  The most important component of the APS, the photodiode, is modeled as a pulsed 
current source representing the photocurrent (I  = 100 nA to 350 nA) in parallel with a 
photo
capacitor representing the diode capacitance (C  = 20 fF) and a direct current (DC) current 
diode
source representing the dark current (I  = 2 fA) [125]. I  = 500 nA and C  = 1 pF are 
dark bias bias
assigned to the biasing circuitry. The values are selected to be consistent with the 32 nm 
technology node. Higher bias current (I ) ensures a smaller readout time. 
bias
  A typical two-dimensional array of M × N pixels is organized into M rows and N 
columns. Pixels in a given row share reset lines, so that a whole row is reset at a time. The select 
lines of each pixel in a row are tied together. The outputs of each pixel in any given column are 
tied together. Since only one row at a time is selected, no competition for the output line occurs. 
Further amplifier circuitry is typically on a column basis. Figure 5.29 shows the block diagram 
of an 8 × 8 APS array implemented by using 64 single pixels of the type shown in figure 5.30.

The array is accessed pixel-wise. The functional simulation results of the array are shown in 
figure 5.31 for high illumination photocurrent. An output voltage swing of 428 mV can be 
observed. The result is obtained from transient analysis of the APS array.

5.4.1. Models for the Figures of Merit of the APS array 
  I now discuss the baseline characterization of the APS array. The models used for 
characterizing the various figures of merit are presented. The array has been characterized for the 
following figures of merit or attributes: (i) average power dissipation P , (ii) capture time 
APS
C , (iii) output voltage swing V , and (iv) dynamic range DR. For measuring P , we have 
time swing APS
used the models provided in chapter 2. 
5.4.1.1. Output Voltage Swing 
  The output voltage swing (V ) of array is defined as the maximum swing achieved by 
swing
the output voltage. It is an important figure of merit because it affects the dynamic range (DR) of 
the array. From figure 5.32, I measured baseline V  as 428 mV. This value is 47.6% of V , 
swing dd
which is in the acceptable range (chapter 3). 
5.4.1.2. Dynamic Range (DR) 
  The DR of array can be formulated as follows [125]: 
 

where σ2  = variance of noise because of readout and reset (in electron2), t  = integration

period. The baseline DR of the APS for 32 nm CMOS technology is calculated to be 59.47 dB. 
8 4 
5.4.1.3. Capture Time 
  The input to each pixel in the array has been modeled in the form of a pulse shaped 
photocurrent I . The capture time is defined as the delay from the 50% level of the input 
photo
swing (I ) to the 50% level of the output voltage (V ). For measurement of capture time 
photo out
(C ) of the array, I considered the pixel in the middle of the array because it suffers the 
time
maximum loading. Thus, it gives us the maximum C  of the array. The APS array has a 
time
baseline C  of 5.65 µs for 32 nm CMOS. The APS array baseline results are in table 5.7.

CHAPTER 6 
PROCESS VARIATION ANALYSIS AND DESIGN OPTIMIZATION 
  In this chapter, I provide the implementation details of the optimization methodologies 
discussed in chapter 4. Each of the mixed-signal circuits has been subjected to an optimization 
approach to verify its process variation tolerance. 
6.1. Analog-to-digital Converter (ADC) 
  The 90 nm ADC discussed in chapter 5 was subjected to a corner-based methodology 
described in this section. First, the results for process and supply variation are presented, 
followed by temperature variation characterization of the ADC. 
6.1.1. Process and Supply Variation 
  Process and supply variation in an ADC is a critical issue. Whereas process variation is a 
static problem, the supply variation is a dynamic problem [47]. The ADC was tested for the 
effects of threshold voltage mismatch and supply voltage variation on the integral nonlinearity 
(INL) and differential nonlinearity (DNL). It is assumed that V  is not sensitive to variation 
switching
in the length of the transistors (L , L ), because the effective switching resistances of 
pmos nmos
transistors are independent of their lengths (equation 8). Hence, the effect that is due to device 
mismatch can be modeled to some degree by the effect of threshold voltage mismatch.  
  The results revealed that while the INL and DNL values were within control, a shift 
occurred in the input voltage range. Consequently, the V  value also changed. To overcome 
LSB
this shift, one may add a programmable preamplifier to the input signal of the ADC, thereby 
adjusting the signal offset and amplitude [32], or DSP may be performed on the ADC, which is 
suitable for system-on-a-chip (SoC) applications, because an on-chip processor might be present. 
8 6 
A corner-based process variation methodology was used for testing the ADC. The methodology 
is shown in figure 6.1.  
 
Figure 6.1. Corner methodology used for the process variation study. 
  The n-type metal oxide semiconductor (NMOS) threshold voltage (V ) and the p-type 
tnmos
metal oxide semiconductor (PMOS) threshold voltage (V ) were varied by ±5% from their 
tpmos
nominal values specified in the process design kit (PDK), and the INL, DNL, and input voltage 
range values were recorded. The results are summarized in table 6.1.

The INL shows a variation from +0.2% to +10.5% and the DNL shows a variation from +2.2% 
to +5.7%. For the supply voltage variation, the nominal supply voltage (1.2 V) was varied by 
±10%, and the INL, DNL, and input voltage range values were recorded, as shown in table 6.2.  
Table 6.2. Supply Voltage Variation Results

The INL shows a variation of −1% to +4%, and the DNL shows a variation of +1.8% to +4.8%. 
It can be observed that the INL and DNL values are satisfactory [INL, DNL < 0.5 least 
significant bit (LSB)]. Hence, the ADC is process and supply variation tolerant. 
6.1.2. Temperature Variation Characterization 
  If the temperature of a device is changed, the mobility, the channel length, and the 
threshold voltage of the device are affected [10]. Thus, it is essential to consider the effect of 
temperature variation on ADC performance. The ADC was subjected to an extensive range of 
temperature (−40°C to 90°C), and the INL and DNL values were recorded. The 27°C was treated 
as the nominal temperature. The INL showed less sensitivity to temperature variations than the 
DNL. Efforts are going on to make the DNL robust to temperature variation. A shift was also 
observed in the input voltage range, leading to a decrease (at −40°C) or increase (at 90°C) in 
V  value. The results are shown in table 6.3. This shift can be compensated for by subjecting 
LSB
the input signal to preamplification before feeding it to the ADC.

6.2. Voltage-controlled Oscillator (VCO) 
  This section demonstrates how the oscillation frequency discrepancy arising because of 
parasitics and process variation have been overcome with minimal modification of the physical 
design. The parasitic-aware optimization is discussed first, followed by the parasitic- and 
process-variation-aware optimization. 
6.2.1. Parasitic-aware Optimization 
  For the optimization, first a baseline logical design was performed with the design 
equations presented in chapter 5. The physical design was prepared with that baseline design. 
After full extraction (resistance, capacitance, inductance, self-inductance) (RCLK), a 25% 
degradation in the oscillation frequency was observed between the logical and the physical 
designs (figure 6.2): 
•  Target oscillation frequency f  = 2 GHz 
0
•  Logical design oscillation frequency f  = 1.95 GHz 
0log
•  Physical design oscillation frequency f  = 1.56 GHz 
0phys
 
 
8 9 
 
Figure 6.2. Comparison of frequency-voltage characteristics of the logical design and parasitic 
extracted physical design of the VCO. 
 
  The parasitic-aware netlist, generated from the first layout (including parasitics), was 
then subjected to an optimization loop using an analog simulator and a conjugate gradient 
optimization technique (algorithm 1) in which the design variables were varied in order to 
achieve the required performance criterion (oscillation frequency). The set of design variables 
used for optimization were the following:  
•  Widths of NMOS devices in the inverter (W ) 
n
•  Widths of PMOS devices in the inverter (W ) 
p
•  Widths of NMOS devices in the current-starved circuitry (W ) 
ncs
•  Widths of PMOS devices in the current-starved circuitry (W ) 
pcs
  Since the channel length (L) of the transistor more effectively controls the performance 
(frequency ∝ 1 = L2), I kept the channel lengths constant ( L  = L  = L  = L  = 100 nm) and 
n p ncs pcs
varied the channel widths. These are the constraints for the design methodology. My objective 
9 0 
function was a target oscillation frequency of 2 GHz. The stopping criterion was within 2% of 
target The final optimal values of the design variables are given in table 6.4.

The physical design of the VCO was carried out with these parameter values, and the following 
results were obtained: 
•  Target oscillation frequency f  = 2 GHz

•  Logical design oscillation frequency f  = 1:95 GHz

•  Parasitic aware physical design oscillation frequency f  = 1:98 GHz

  I was able to obtain convergence with only one iteration in the layout. The final 
optimized layout for the parasitic-aware VCO is in figure 6.3. Figure 6.4 shows the frequency-
voltage transfer curves for the logical and the physical design after parasitic-aware optimization. 
The optimized curve closely follows the logical design curve. The measured performance of the 
VCO is given in table 6.5.

6.2.2. Process Variation Study 
  It can be seen from equations 16 and 18 that the oscillation frequency shows strong 
dependence on V , threshold voltage of the CMOS V  (I  depends on V ), and gate oxide 
DD T D T
thickness T . Hence, any variation in these process (V , T ) parameters and supply (V ) would

lead to a degradation in the oscillation frequency. Process variations can be modeled by using 
technology files or analytical formulas. Technology files are process-dependent and can be 
created from the information provided by foundries. In this work, a technology file based on a 
general 90 nm process design kit was used. For the VCO, the following parameters were 
identified for process variation:

  In this section, I present the results of statistical process variation carried out on the 
parasitic extracted netlist of the VCO. Statistical variations in the process parameters, each 
assumed to be Gaussian, were explicitly taken into account by using Monte Carlo simulations, 
and the effect on oscillation frequency was observed [49]. In particular, 5 different cases were 
recorded.

6.2.3. Parasitic- and Process-variation-aware Optimization 
  For the parasitic- and process-variation-aware design, baseline logical design presented in 
chapter 5 was used. The physical design was prepared by using this baseline design. A 25% 
discrepancy in the oscillation frequency was observed between the logical and the fully extracted 
(RCLK) physical design (as discussed in section 6.2.1). The parasitic parameterized netlist 
derived from this initial physical design was then subjected to process and supply variation 
where V , V , V , T  and T  were varied by ±10% from their nominal values.

The worst case is identified as the one in which V  is reduced by 10%, and all the process

parameters increased by 10%. In this case, a 43.5% discrepancy was observed in the oscillation

GHz with a stopping criterion of 2%. The parasitic parameterized netlist generated from the first 
layout iteration was subjected to the optimization loop where the design variables were varied in 
9 8 
order to achieve the required performance criterion (oscillation frequency) in a worst-case 
process variation environment [48]. The design variables were the constraints for the design 
methodology. The sets of design variables used for optimization were as follows: 
•  Widths of NMOS devices in the inverter (W ) 
n
•  Widths of PMOS devices in the inverter (W ) 
p
•  Widths of NMOS devices in the current-starved circuitry (W ) 
ncs
•  Widths of PMOS devices in the current-starved circuitry (W ) 
pcs
•  Lengths of all devices (L  = L  = L  = L  = L) 
n p ncs pcs
  The final optimal values obtained for the design variables are recorded in table 6.8.

The physical design of the VCO was then carried out using these parameter values, and the 
following results were obtained:

  Hence, I obtained a final optimized layout, with 1.91 GHz oscillation frequency under 
worst case process variation and 2.54 GHz oscillation frequency in nominal-case process 
conditions. This parasitic-aware, process-variation-tolerant layout of the VCO is shown in figure 
6.11.

  I was able to obtain convergence with only one iteration in layout. This technique can 
also be applied for optimization of other parameters, such as phase noise and jitter. [54]. Figure 
6.12 shows the frequency-voltage transfer curves for the logical and the physical designs after 
parasitic and process-variation-aware optimization. It is evident that the optimized curve closely 
10 0 
follows the logical design curve. I also obtained a phase noise of −109.13 dBc/Hz at an offset 
frequency of 10 MHz. The performance summary of the VCO is shown in table 6.9.

6.2.4. Physical Design of the Optimal VCO 
  The physical design of the VCO was carried out using a generic 90 nm salicide 1.2 V/2.5 
V 1 poly-9 metal process design kit. A full extraction of the layout was performed [including 
resistors (R), capacitors (C), inductors (L) and mutual inductors (K)] so that the impact of 
inductive coupling could be assessed and minimized on the layout. The final layouts for the 
parasitic-aware design flow and parasitic- and process-variation-aware design flow are shown in 
figures 6.3 and 6.11, respectively. For the parasitic- and process-variation-aware design, 
multifingered transistors are laid out to minimize the area's overhead, considering that the 
optimization resulted in wide transistors. 
6.3. Universal Voltage Level Converter (ULC) 
  To minimize power, I first identified the power-hungry transistors (shown in figure 5.20) 
by measuring the power consumed by each transistor of the circuit. The power estimation 
included dynamic, subthreshold, and gate leakage, as presented in chapter 2. These transistors 
were then subjected to the power-delay optimization technique. Two types of optimization 
techniques were used: 
•  Dual T  
ox
•  Dual V  
T
6.3.1. Dual T  Technique 
ox
  The T  was varied between 10% and 200% of its nominal value, and the width of 
ox
transistors was varied from 120 nm to 1 µm. All transistors were assumed to have an effective 
length of 100 nm corresponding to the nominal value of the 90 nm process design kit used. To 
optimize the power and delay, I varied the following parameters: 
•  T  of the power-hungry NMOS transistors (T )

•  Width (W ) of the NMOS transistors of the up converter 
nmosup
•  Width (W ) of the PMOS transistors of the up converter

The final optimal values of these parameters are given in table 6.10.

The optimized values of delay and power were obtained as:

•  Delay of up converter (Delay ) = 80.35 ps

•  Delay of down converter (Delay ) = 80.43 ps 
down
•  Average delay (Delay ) = 80.39 ps 
ULC
  I achieved 83% power savings compared to the baseline design and 60% delay savings 
compared to the existing designs presented in the literature [57].

6.3.2. Dual V  Technique 
T
  The dual V  technique [34] was used along with transistor geometry to achieve a 
T
power-delay optimized ULC. Minimizing power consumption was the target objective function, 
with a delay constraint. The power-hungry transistors were assigned high V  values, which 
T
reduced the power consumption considerably but which also increased the delay (equation 4). 
Hence, the transistor geometry was also explored, where the widths of all the transistors in the 
level-up and level-down converters were considered. Hence, a simultaneous variation of the 
design variables (i.e., V , V , W , W , W , and W ) achieved a good

•  Delay of up converter (Delay ) = 95.1 ps

•  Delay of down converter (Delay ) = 95.7 ps

•  Average delay (Delay ) = 95.4 ps 
ULC
  With the dual threshold, complementary metal oxide semiconductor (DVTCMOS) 
technique, 178% power savings occurred compared to the baseline design and 35% delay savings 
occurred compared to the existing designs presented in the literature [57].  
6.3.3. Characterization 
  In low-power circuit designs, it is of paramount importance to consider various design 
constraints concerning power consumption, lower voltage level and load, and many more. My 
design of the universal voltage level converter (ULC) mainly focuses on low-power multivoltage 
circuit applications. Thus, it is essential to consider these design limitations. Keeping in mind 
these design constraints and ensuring that the ULC design is essentially a low-power-consuming 
circuit in itself, I studied and analyzed the ULC circuit under various input conditions. The 
circuit was characterized by performing the following three analyses: 
•  Parametric analysis 
•  Load analysis 
•  Power analysis 
These characterizations are discussed in the following subsections. 
 
10 5 
6.3.3.1. Parametric Analysis 
  Parametric analysis is a process in which the circuit's behavior is observed while 
continuously changing one of its input parameters. In this type of analysis, a transient analysis is 
carried out where in the output voltage is observed for a varying input voltage. For testing the 
level-up converter, V  was varied from 0.1 V to 1.02 V with an increasing step of 0.1 V. The 
in
value of control signals S1, S0 was kept at 1, 0 to achieve the level-up conversion functionality. 
The output signal was observed at the output terminal V  of the ULC. The plot for the 
out
parametric analysis for up conversion is shown in the lower graph (b) of figure 6.13, which 
confirms that the circuit produces a stable output even for a voltage V  as low as 0.65 V. The 
in
same steps were followed for level-down converter parametric analysis. The values for the 
control signals S1, S0 were kept at 0, 1. In this case, V  was varied from 0.1 V to 1.2 V with an 
in
increasing step size of 0.1 V. The output plot for the down converter parametric analysis is 
shown in the upper graph (a) of figure 6.13. From the plot, it can be determined that the down 
converter circuit can produce a stable output even for V  as low as 0.6 V.

6.3.3.2. Load Analysis 
  Load analysis is a very important category of analysis for any electrical system design. 
Load analysis helps the designer understand the transient behavior of a system at different loads 
which mainly helps in verifying the overall system functionality. Each gate connected to the 
output of another gate loads the later gate. Electronic constraints limit the load on a gate and 
hence the number of gates connected to its output. The ULC is used as an interface between two 
circuits (or gates) operating at different voltage levels. The output load of the level converting 
circuit may change quite often. Thus, it is of great importance to ensure that the design of ULC 
produces the desired results even under such varying load conditions. Therefore, a load analysis 
on the ULC is performed when the output load capacitance of the circuit is varied and the effect 
of that on the output signal is observed.  
 
10 7 
  During the load analysis of the ULC, the output of the circuit is studied by varying the 
capacitive load at the output from 10 fF to 200 fF. These values of load capacitance represent 
realistic loads [128] for a 90 nm CMOS technology. From this analysis, it can be concluded that 
the ULC produces stable output under varying load conditions. This design feature is important 
for voltage level converters. Figure 6.14 shows the output plot for load analysis on the complete 
ULC. 
 
Figure 6.14. Performance of the ULC under varying output capacitive load. 
6.3.3.3. Power Analysis 
  Power analysis includes determining the total power consumed by the overall ULC 
circuit. During the power analysis, the total power consumed by the ULC at three different 
loads of 10 fF, 45 fF and 90 fF is calculated (shown in table 6.12). It is evident that there is not a 
significant difference in power consumption with varying loads.

and gate-oxide leakage consumed by the circuit.

6.4. Active Pixel Sensor (APS) 
  The design flow presented in figure 6.16 was used for variability-aware optimization of a 
nanometer-scale CMOS APS array.  
10 9 
 
Figure 6.16. Proposed design flow for optimal design of nano-CMOS APS array. 
  The first step in the design flow was the design of a baseline array for a specific nano-
CMOS technology node. Then, the baseline M × N array was simulated for functional 
correctness. This step was followed by measuring the baseline values of the various figures of 
merit, such as power, leakage, voltage swing, and capture time. The target figures of merit that 
needed to be optimized were identified. Because nanoscale circuits suffer from high leakage, I 
chose to optimize average power (P ) with minimum degradation in output voltage swing 
APS
(V ). These metrics are defined in chapter 5.  
swing
  In the next step, the parameters to be used for process variation were identified. The array 
was then subjected to simultaneous “intra-array" mismatch and “inter-array" process variation. 
The intra-array mismatch can also be interpreted as pixel-to-pixel variation. This variation 
enables designers to consider the trade-off between matched transistor size and yield when 
designing their circuits.  
  Once the process variation results were analyzed, the design flow proceeded to the 
optimization. In the optimization, the parameters to be used as design variables were identified. 
Then I performed a design and analysis optimization based on Monte Carlo experiments. The 
design flow led to an optimized APS array, which is also the output of this design flow. The 
11 0 
details of the optimization algorithm were presented in chapter 4. Hence, the end product was a 
M × N APS array optimized for nanoscale process variations.  
  The APS array was subjected to simultaneous intra-array mismatch and inter-array 
process variation, and the effects on the figures of merit were studied. The process parameters 
identified for mismatch and process variation were: (i) supply voltage V , (ii) 
dd
NMOS threshold voltage V , (iii) PMOS threshold voltage V , (iv) NMOS 
Tnmos Tpmos
gate-oxide thickness T , and (v) PMOS gate-oxide thickness T . The figures of merit 
oxnmos oxpmos
under consideration were P  and V . Hence they formed the objective set F for 
APS swing
optimization.  The process parameters were subjected to intra-array mismatch and inter-array 
process variation simultaneously for R = 1000 runs. For the intra-array mismatch, the parameters 
were assumed to have a Gaussian distribution and were assigned mean (µ) values as the baseline 
values specified in the predictive technology model (PTM), and a standard deviation (σ) of 5%. 
For the inter-array process variation, the parameters were also assumed to have a Gaussian 
distribution and were assigned mean (µ) values as the baseline values specified in the PTM and a 
standard deviation (σ) of 10%. P  shows a lognormal distribution in the upper graph (a) of 
APS
figure 17. Because of significant impact of various leakage mechanisms (P , P ) having an 
sub gate
exponential relationship with the process parameters, this observation was intuitive from the 
governing expressions. V  showed a Gaussian (normal) distribution [figure 17(b)]. This 
swing
distribution is considered the baseline case.

  To demonstrate the array optimization, P  minimization and V  maximization were 
APS swing
kept as the objectives. Power is always a contraint for nanoscale SoCs. Hence, P  was chosen. 
APS
Also, V  directly affects the dynamic range of the APS, thus giving an important measure of 
swing
performance. The proposed methodology can also be extended to other figures of merit as a 
multiobjective optimization. However, it is unlikely that both these objectives would be 
optimized by the same alternative parameter choices. For design and analysis of Monte Carlo 
experiments, the parameters to be used as design variables for optimization were identified as 
follows: (i) supply voltage V , (ii) NMOS gate-oxide thickness T , and (iii) PMOS gate-
dd oxnmos
oxide thickness T . From the power model equations presented in chapter 2, it can be seen 
oxpmos
that these parameters affect the power consumption significantly. Hence, they form the design 
variable set D for the optimization algorithm. I did not consider V  and V  as optimization 
Tnmos Tpmos
parameters because they depend on a variety of parameters, such as doping concentration of 
source or drain diffusions and channel length [1]. 
11 2 
  I now present the algorithm for two values of design variables with H denoting high and 
L denoting low values. Thus, V , V , T , and T  are the possible values of the design 
dd-H dd-L ox-H ox-L
variables. V  and T  are baseline values as per the 32 nm CMOS technology node. V  
dd-H ox-L dd
scaling refers to reduction in V  (i.e. from V  to V ), whereas T  scaling refers to increase 
dd dd-H dd-L ox
in T  (i.e., from T  to T ). As in a traditional CMOS process, the gate oxides of NMOS and 
ox ox-L ox-H
PMOS transistors are grown together, T ; T  are scaled together, i.e., they are assigned 
oxnmos oxpmos
either a higher (T ) or a lower (T ) value together. 
ox-H ox-L
  For the above scenario, we have four different combinations. However, the situation is 
much more involved for other discrete sets of design variables. These values are assigned to the 
µ of optimization parameters for R = 100 Monte Carlo runs. The array is subjected to 5% intra-
array mismatch and 10% inter-array process variation for each of the four combinations. The 
Monte Carlo data for F are obtained and normalized. Normalization involves division of each 
value of the data by the maximum value of data. The µ and σ values for P  and V  are listed 
APS swing
in table 6.13 for V  = 0.9V, V  = 0.7V , T  = 2.0nm, and T  = 1.65nm. P  is observed

to have a lognormal distribution [figure 17(a), 18(a), 19(a), and 20(a)] and V  is observed to

have a Gaussian distribution [figure 17(b), 18(b), 19(b), and 20(b)] using a least-squares fit.

  The following prediction equations were obtained by using the design of experiments

where Yˆ is the response, Yis the average, and  dd  and  ox  are the half effects of the design

variables. A linear relationship between the design variables and the response is assumed, as this 
reduces the complexity considerably, with a maximum discrepancy of 1% between the observed 
results and the results calculated with the predictive equations. If a nonlinear relationship is 
11 5 
assumed, the complexity would increase exponentially. From equations 21, 22 and 24, it can be 
observed that μˆP  , σˆ P  and σˆ V  are to be minimized for power minimization, whereas 
APS APS swing
μˆ V  needs to be maximized for V  maximization (equation 23). It can be seen that μˆ P  
swing swing APS
and σˆP  are perfectly correlated; i.e., optimizing the mean would also optimize the standard 
APS
deviation. However, μˆV  and σˆ V  are not correlated. Hence, a combined effect of the 
swing swing
mean and the standard deviation must be considered for possible generalization of the proposed 
methodology. This information is also available only after the prediction equations have been 
obtained.  
  The purpose of the paper is process optimization. Parametric yield is not under 
consideration here. I formed two objective functions, fPAPS and fVswing, as follows:

  From equations 26 and 27, it can be seen that fPAPS needs to be minimized and fVswing 
needs to be maximized. The Pareto chart for fPAPS in figure 21(a) shows that the design variable 
set D = [Vdd-L, Tox-H] leads to the minimum value of fPAPS. The value of fVswing corresponding to 
this set [figure 21(b)] is also acceptable. This is confirmed by using this value of D to simulate 
the array, which yields an acceptable V  (46.4% of V ). Because a nanoscale circuit is

involved, power minimization is treated as primary objective. A reduction of 21% in P  with a 
APS
24% reduction penalty in V  can be achieved. The baseline and optimal values of P  and

CHAPTER 7 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS 
  This chapter presents a summary of the dissertation, followed by conclusions drawn from 
the research. Finally, directions for future research are discussed.  
7.1. Summary 
  This dissertation describes low-power design techniques that were applied to nanoscale 
and emerging technology based mixed-signal circuits. Optimization approaches have been 
applied to these circuits to achieve low-power designs which are also process-variation-tolerant. 
The optimization methodologies proposed are the following: 
•  Single iteration automatic approach 
•  Hybrid Monte Carlo/DOE approach 
•  Corner-based methodology 
The following circuits were subjected to these optimization methodologies: 
•  90 nm analog-to-digital converter (ADC) 
•  90 nm voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) 
•  90 nm universal voltage level converter (ULC) 
•  32 nm active pixel sensor (APS) 
The following section presents the conclusions drawn from the experimental results. 
7.2. Conclusions 
  For the ADC, the design of a process- and supply-variation-aware, low-voltage, high-
speed circuit was presented. The design was functionally verified and characterized for 
nanoscale feature sizes (90 nm and 45 nm). The physical design of the ADC was performed by 
using a 90 nm digital complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process, 
11 9 
demonstrating its system-on-a-chip (SoC) readiness. The comparators were designed by using 
the threshold inverting technique. The nominal results at 90 nm show that the ADC has an 
integral nonlinearity (INL) of 0.344 least significant bit (LSB) and a differential nonlinearity 
(DNL) of 0.459 LSB, showing a maximum variation of 10.5% and 5.7%, respectively, when 
subjected to ±10% variation in the supply and ±5% mismatch in the transistor threshold voltages. 
The analog supply voltage is 1.2 V. At 45 nm, the ADC exhibits INL = 0.46 LSB, DNL = 0.7 
LSB at a supply voltage of 0.7 V. This is one of the lowest published power supply values used 
to implement high speed 6-bit ADCs. Several design issues were also addressed and used in the 
optimization procedure of the ADC; e.g., current-resistance (IR) drop and low V . It is 
LSB
demonstrated that the design of low-voltage, high-speed, and SoC-ready ADCs is possible at 90 
nm technology and below. 
  For the VCO, two novel design foows for parasitic- and process-variation-aware design 
methodology for optimization of performance for radiofrequency (RF) circuit components have 
been presented. The first design flow, called parasitic aware design flow, considers parasitics. 
The second design flow considers process variation along with parasitics; hence, it is called 
parasitic- and process-variation-aware design flow. A high-frequency, low-phase noise, current-
starved VCO was used as a case study. The oscillation frequency was treated as the target 
specification. The degradation of the oscillation frequency that was due to parasitics only was 
narrowed down from 25% to 1%. The degradation of the oscillation frequency that was due to 
parasitic and process variation effects was narrowed down from 43.5% to 4.5% in only one 
iteration of the physical design, a tremendous reduction in overall design time. Thus, I obtained a 
parasitic- and process-variation-aware design, as the target technology is nanoscale CMOS in 
which such variations do affect design metrics and yield. 
12 0 
  For the ULC, a dual-gate oxide thickness (T ) (DOXCMOS)/ dual-threshold (V ) 
ox T
(DVTCMOS) approach along with transistor geometry variations to reduce the power-delay 
overhead of a ULC has been proposed. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first ULC being 
subjected to such power-saving techniques. It was observed that while DVTCMOS might be the 
preferred technique for achieving lower power, DOXCMOS gives better delay savings. Other 
analog circuits might also be subjected to such techniques in the future.  
  The ULC is capable of performing three types of distinct operations on the input signal; 
i.e., level-up conversion, level-down conversion, and blocking of the input signal. This makes 
the ULC highly suitable for use in the context of dynamic power management techniques in 
circuits. The robustness of the level converter is tested by using parametric, load and power 
analysis. It is observed that a stable output is obtained for voltages as low as 0.6 V and capacitive 
loads varying from 10 fF to 200 fF. The average power consumption of the level converter is 
16.68 milliwatts (µW) with DOXCMOS, and 10.95 µW with DVTCMOS, making the design 
suitable for low power applications. The design is also area-optimal. The physical design of the 
level converter was also presented. At 90 nm technology, subthreshold leakage is more dominant 
than gate oxide leakage [5]. Hence, from table 7.1 it can be seen that DVTCMOS achieves more 
power savings than DOXCMOS. However, the DOXCMOS technique shows better delay 
savings than DVTCMOS. Depending on the requirements of the designer, a choice can be made.

DOXCMOS  16.68 µW  83%  80.39 ps  60%

  For the APS, I presented a novel design flow and optimization algorithm suitable for 
variation-tolerant (robust) design of nano-CMOS-based APS array. A 32 nm 8 × 8 APS array 
was subjected to this design flow in the presence of simultaneous intra-array mismatch and inter-
array process variation. This gives APS designers an insight into the yield of their circuits that 
might be caused by transistor mismatch and process variation before going into fabrication. 
Design and analysis of Monte Carlo experiments on the baseline array was carried out leading to 
21% power reduction at the cost of 24% output voltage swing reduction. 
7.3. Future Research 
  For the ADC, as part of a future work, I plan to carry out the complete design cycle 
including physical design for this ADC at 45 nm. Alternative encoder architectures will be 
explored to achieve higher sampling speeds.  For the VCO, the current work might be extended to 
study the simultaneous optimization of oscillation frequency, response linearity and phase noise 
using the proposed methodology.  
  As part of future work for the ULC, I plan to implement this design at a lower technology 
node, i.e., 45 nm. The layout rules will be scaled from 90 nm to 45 nm and the layout of the 
design will be carried out. Efforts are also being undertaken to include the block functionality in 
the level converter design itself. In addition, the impact of parasitics on the performance of the 
ULC physical design using dual-V  and dual-T  process kits might be studied. For future work 
T ox
on the APS, I plan to implement the proposed array using alternative technologies such as high-
κ/metal gate, carbon nanotube (CNT), dual-gate field effect transistors (FETs) and analyze their 
performance.

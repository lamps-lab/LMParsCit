We analyze the contribution of North American (NA) lightning and 
anthropogenic emissions to summertime ozone concentrations, radiative forcing, and 
exports from North America using the global University of Maryland chemistry 
transport model (UMD-CTM) and the regional scale Weather Research and 
Forecasting model with chemistry (WRF-Chem). Lightning NO contributes by 15–20 
ppbv to upper tropospheric ozone concentrations over the United States with the 
effects of NA lightning on ozone seen as far east as North Africa and Europe. Using 
the UMD-CTM, we compare changes in surface and column ozone amounts due to 
the NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) Call with the natural variability in ozone 
due to changes in meteorology and lightning. Comparing early summer 2004 with 
2002, surface ozone decreased by up to 5 ppbv due to the NOx SIP Call while 
changes in meteorology and lightning resulted in a 0.3–1.4 ppbv increase in surface 
 
ozone. Ozone column variability was driven primarily by changes in lightning NO 
emissions, especially over the North Atlantic. As part of our WRF-Chem analysis, we 
modify the radiation schemes to use model-calculated ozone (interactive ozone) 
instead of climatological ozone profiles and conduct multiple 4-day simulations of 
July 2007. We found that interactive ozone increased the outgoing longwave radiation 
(OLR) by 3 W m−2 decreasing the bias with respect to remotely sensed OLR. The 
improvement is due to a high bias in the climatological ozone profiles. The interactive 
ozone had a small impact on mean upper troposphere temperature (−0.15°C). The 
UMD-CTM simulations indicate that NA anthropogenic emissions are responsible for 
more ozone export but less ozone radiative forcing than lightning NO emissions. 
Over the North Atlantic, NA anthropogenic emissions contributed 0.15–0.30 W m−2 
to the net downward radiative flux at the tropopause while NA lightning contributed 
0.30–0.50 W m−2. The ozone export from anthropogenic emissions was almost twice 
as large as that from lightning emissions. The WRF-Chem simulations show that the 
export of reactive nitrogen was 23%−28% of the boundary layer emissions and 
26%−38% of the total emissions including lightning NO.

List of Figures 
 
Figure 1. Radiative forcing (RF) of climate between 1750 and 2005 as estimated 
by the IPCC. Estimates of RF are accompanied by both an uncertainty range 
and a level of scientific understanding (LOSU). The value uncertainties 
represent the 5 to 95% (90%) confidence range, and are based on available 
published studies; the LOSU is a subjective measure of structural 
uncertainty and represents how well understood the underlying processes 
are [IPCC, 2007]. ................................................................................................ 10	  
Figure 2. Surface NOx emission change from summer 2002 to 2004 at the 2° × 
2.5° resolution as represented in the UMD-CTM standard simulations. 
Negative values indicate ANOx emission decreases from 2002 to 2004. ........... 17	  
Figure 3. Surface temperatures in summer 2002, 2003 and 2004 (from 
www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/research/2004/CMB_prod_us_2004.html). 
Changes in GEOS-4 CERES temperatures, used in the UMD-CTM 
simulations, from summer 2002 to 2004 are smaller than the observed 
temperature changes shown in this figure. The mean GEOS-4 CERES 
temperature change from summer 2002 to 2004 over the region of high 
isoprene emissions (28°N–40°N and 74°W–96°W) is −1.5°C. Isoprene 
emissions used in the UMD-CTM simulations are from summer 2003. ............ 24	  
Figure 4. Total (IC + CG) lightning flash rates for the summers 2002 (blue) and 
2004 (red) over the CONUS derived from the NLDN-observed CG flashes 
(adjusted by the IC/CG ratios). Flash rates are smoothed with a 7 day 
moving average. .................................................................................................. 30	  
Figure 5. Convective mass fluxes (mean from the surface to 700 hPa) averaged 
for (a) 1 June to 17 July 2004 and (c) 18 July to 31 August 2004 and the 
relative change (%) between 2002 and 2004 averaged for (b) early and (d) 
late summer. Warm (cold) colors indicate more (less) vertical mixing by 
convection in 2004 than in 2002. Convective mass fluxes are calculated as 
the sum of deep convection and shallow convection fields from the GEOS-4 
CERES reanalysis. .............................................................................................. 31

Figure 8. Total (IC + CG) lightning flash rates derived from NLDN ground and 
LIS spaceborne observations over the CONUS (land only) south of 35°N 
during 2002–2005. CG flash rates detected by the NLDN network (adjusted 
by the IC/CG ratios) are smoothed spatially (7.5° boxcar) and temporally 
(98 day window) and averaged for each month (indicated by the asterisks). 
Monthly LIS observations (LRMTS) were also smoothed with 98 day and 
7.5° moving average. .......................................................................................... 33	  
Figure 9. Early summer (1 June to 17 July) 2004 model flash rates. (left) Flash 
rates are adjusted to match OTD/LIS Low Resolution Time Series flash 
rates in simulation L0. (right) Flash rates are adjusted to match the NLDN-
based total IC + CG flash rates over the CONUS (land only) in simulation 
L1. The NLDN-based model flash rates for early summer 2004 differ 
slightly from the NLDN-based observed flash rates (right panel in Figure 7) 
because the scaling is done on a month by month basis while this figure 
depicts a 1.5 month period (1 June to 17 July). .................................................. 34	  
Figure 10. Mean vertical profiles of NO, O3, CO, HNO3, NOx, OH, PAN and 
NOy. Measurements from the DC-8 aircraft (blue) are compared to UMD-
CTM results from the L0 (black), L1 (red) and L2 (dashed red) simulations. 
The 1 min average measurements are compared to hourly UMD-CTM 
output sampled along the flight tracks. NOy is estimated as the sum of its 
main oxidation products (NOx, PAN, and HNO3). We use here HNO3 data 
obtained by science team from California Institute of Technology. 
Horizontal bars indicate standard deviations on the observations in each 50-
hPa bin. The number of filtered observations above 500 hPa is listed in the 
upper-right corner of each plot. The absolute values of the bias (model 
minus observation) averaged from 50-hPa bins above 500 hPa are listed in 
the middle right part of each plot: L0 bias (top value), L1 bias (center 
value), and L2 bias (bottom value). Note the logarithmic scale for NO and 
NOx. .................................................................................................................... 39

The UMD-CTM is sampled at each SCIAMACHY pixel. Both observed 
(Figures 12a and 12b) and modeled (Figures 12d and 11e) columns are 
composited to a 0.54° × 0.70° (about 60 × 60 km2) grid which is close to the 
native resolution of SCIAMACHY. In the ORV region (indicated by the 
larger box on the left), SCIAMACHY observed reduction from 4.27 to 3.32 
on average between 2002 and 2004, whereas simulated columns were 
reduced from 4.24 to 3.43 (all values in units of 1015 NO2 molecules cm−2).

Figure 24. (a) Mean flash rate distribution during July 2007 as estimated by 
multiplying the NLDN CG flash rate by Z + 1, where Z is the smoothed 
climatological IC/CG ratio. (b) Convective precipitation (3 hour totals) as 
predicted by WRF. Model flash rate (c) based on look up table [Hansen, 
2012] and (d) based on convective precipitation [Allen et al., 2012]. Model 
flash rates in Figures 24c and 24d are scaled so the monthly sum over the 
CONUS matches the NLDN-based sum in Figure 24b. All flash rates are in 
units of flash s−1 per 36-km grid box. Detection efficiency for NLDN 
observed flashes falls off rapidly with distance from coast. Therefore NLDN 
flash rates do not represent actual flash rates for locations with distance 
> 300 km from the coast. Model flash rates outside of the CONUS are 
decreased by a factor f = exp(−d / 1000), where d is the distance from the 
coast in km. ......................................................................................................... 84	  
Figure 25. Same as Figures 24a, 24c and 24d except the histogram depicting the 
distributions of 1 h flash rates over the CONUS is shown. The histogram of 
NLDN-based total flash rates is indicated by the blue shaded area, histogram 
of model flash rates based on Hansen [2012] is the blue line and histogram 
of model flash rates based on Allen et al. [2012] is the red line. ........................ 85	  
Figure 26. Time series of daily flash rates summed over the continental United 
States (land only) during July 2007. NLDN-based estimate obtained by

climatological IC/CG ratio, depicted by black line. Model flash rates based 
on convective precipitation [Allen et al., 2012] (red) and model flash rate 
based on convective precipitation and mixed phase depth [Hansen, 2012] 
(blue) are both scaled to match total monthly NLDN (IC + CG) flash rate. 
Correlation between time series of observed and model flash rates (r) is top 
right. .................................................................................................................... 85

1  Introduction 
North America is a major source of anthropogenic and naturally-generated 
trace gases, and North American (NA) emissions affect trace gas mixing ratios over 
the North Atlantic, Europe and North Africa [Li et al., 2002]. A key trace gas for both 
chemistry and radiative balance of the troposphere is ozone (O3). According to IPCC 
[2007], tropospheric O3 is the third most important climate gas. Major precursors of 
tropospheric O3 are nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2) from fuel combustion, soils 
and lightning. Surface precursors are rapidly transported upward via convection 
[Dickerson et al., 1987; Pickering et al., 1992, 1995] and detrained into the upper 
troposphere [Bertram et al., 2007] where concurrent lightning greatly enhances NOx 
[DeCaria et al., 2000, 2005; Zhang et al., 2003; Hudman et al., 2007]. The 
importance of the vertical distribution of O3 and its precursors is emphasized by the 
fact that midtropospheric and upper tropospheric O3 has a larger radiative forcing 
efficiency [Lacis et al., 1990] than O3 in the lower troposphere. Therefore, O3 
resulting from lightning NOx and NOx transported upward in deep convection has the 
greatest consequences for the greenhouse effect [IPCC, 2007]. 
While the IPCC definition of radiative forcing only considers anthropogenic 
changes, in general, both anthropogenic and natural O3 contribute to radiative forcing 
(i.e., reduction in the outgoing longwave radiation). In our study, the radiative forcing 
of O3 produced from anthropogenic emissions and lightning NO emissions is 
considered separately. Although a number of studies analyzed the impact of lightning 
NOx (LNOx) and anthropogenic NOx (ANOx) emissions on the amounts of 
 
 
 
2 
tropospheric NOx and O3 [e.g., Zhang et al., 2003; Hudman et al., 2007, 2009; Allen 
et al., 2010, 2012], the radiative effects due to O3 production from these sources have 
been investigated in relatively few studies. These studies include Dahlmann et al. 
[2011], who conducted multi-decadal simulations using a global chemistry climate 
model, and Choi et al. [2009], who conducted multi-month simulations using a 
regional chemical transport model. 
The first part of the current study focuses on estimating both anthropogenic 
and lightning contributions to radiative forcing using the coarse global chemical 
transport model University of Maryland Chemical Transport Model (UMD-CTM) 
[Park et al., 2004a] with offline radiative forcing calculation. The specific objectives 
are: 
• Compare impacts of anthropogenic and lightning NO emissions on long-range 
transport of trace gases from North America. 
• Quantify the North American anthropogenic and lightning contributions to 
tropospheric ozone and its climate forcing. 
• Analyze the impact of the North American Monsoon and reduced power plant 
emissions between summers 2002 and 2004 (the NOx SIP Call) on the 
radiative forcing of tropospheric ozone. 
The second part of the current study uses the regional scale model WRF-
Chem [Grell et al., 2005], in which chemistry is fully coupled with meteorology and 
radiation, to better account for the highly variable regional character of ozone. We 
incorporate model ozone in the radiation schemes, which we refer to as interactive 
 
 
 
3 
ozone, thus allowing heating rates from ozone to affect the simulated meteorological 
and chemical quantities. The specific objectives are: 
• Test the performance of a new lightning parameterization scheme which uses 
convective precipitation and mixed phase depth as predictors [Hansen, 2012]. 
• Quantify the impact of interactive ozone on outgoing longwave radiation. Test 
whether the inclusion of model ozone in radiation schemes improves the 
accuracy of radiative flux calculations. 
• Quantify the instantaneous radiative forcing due to lightning NOx, which has 
received little attention on a regional scale.

2  Background 
2.1  Tropospheric Ozone Production 
In the clean troposphere, ozone is produced and removed primarily through 
the following reactions: 
 NO2 + hν → NO + O(3P) (1) 
 O(3P) + O2 + M → O3 + M (2) 
 NO + O3 → NO2 + O2 (3) 
Last two reactions are relatively fast. Therefore, the slower photolysis reaction 
1 is usually rate-limiting for this photochemical cycle and the reason why ozone 
concentrations are high during summer when temperatures are high and solar 
radiation is intense. The cycle time for these three reactions is only a few minutes. 
The ozone concentration at steady state is given by the so-called photostationary state 
equation: 
[O3] = jNO2 [NO2] / (kNO+O3 [NO]) 
where jNO2 is the photolysis rate of NO2 and kNO+O3 is the rate constant for reaction 3. 
The net effect is neither to generate nor destroy ozone. 
Ozone is also photolyzed to form excited atomic oxygen O(1D), which 
combines with water to produce the OH radical. The OH radical is important for the 
oxidation of CO and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the polluted troposphere, 
 
 
 
5 
producing HO2 and RO2, respectively. HO2 and RO2 react with NO to create NO2 
without consuming an ozone molecule: 
 HO2 + NO → NO2 + OH 
 RO2 + NO → NO2 + RO 
Ozone production efficiency, the total number of ozone molecules formed per 
molecule of NOx consumed, depends nonlinearly on the abundance of both NOx and 
VOCs. The degree of nonlinearity depends on the VOC/NOx concentration ratio, as 
well as the types of VOC species [Liu et al., 1987; Lin et al., 1988]. In the NOx-
sensitive regime (with relatively low NOx and high VOC), ozone increases with 
increasing NOx and changes little in response to increasing VOC. In the NOx-
saturated or VOC-sensitive regime, ozone decreases with increasing NOx and 
increases with increasing VOC [Sillman, 1999]. 
Major sources of NOx in the troposphere, in order from largest to smallest, 
are: fossil fuel combustion, biomass burning, lightning and soil release. While the two 
largest sources are emitted at the surface, lightning NOx is produced largely in the 
middle to upper troposphere where it is relatively long-lived and more efficient at 
producing ozone. The high temperature in the lightning channel (~30,000 K) causes 
molecular nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2) in the atmosphere to dissociate into their 
atomic states. The formation of NO following a lightning flash is described by the 
Zel’dovich mechanism [Zel’dovich and Razier, 1967]: 
 O(3P) + N2 → NO + N 
 N + O2 → NO + O(3P) 
 
 
 
6 
NO is further oxidized to NO2; however, during daytime conditions, NO2 is also 
quickly photodissociated to NO, and an equilibrium between NO and NO2 is reached 
within minutes. Therefore, it is useful to consider the sum of NO and NO2 (NOx). 
Tropospheric O3 has an average lifetime on the order of weeks. This relatively 
short lifetime compared to the long-lived and well-mixed greenhouse gases (CO2, 
CH4, halocarbons, and N2O) implies that the distribution of tropospheric ozone is 
highly variable in space and time. The longer chemical lifetimes and greater wind 
speeds aloft can then lead to significant long-range transport of NOx during which 
photochemical O3 production occurs. On the other hand, the vertical mixing that 
occurs during convection over unpolluted regions can decrease the tropospheric O3 
column as high O3 air from the upper troposphere (UT) is transported downwards to 
levels where it is destroyed more quickly, and low O3 air that originated near the 
surface is deposited in the UT [Lelieveld and Crutzen, 1994]. 
2.2  Upper Tropospheric NOx and LNOx – Lessons From INTEX-A 
Campaign 
Measurements from the INTEX-A (Intercontinental Chemical Transport 
Experiment–Phase A) aircraft campaign over the contiguous United States (CONUS) 
and adjacent areas [Singh et al., 2006] and from coordinated IONS (INTEX 
Ozonesonde Network Study) ozonesondes launches [Thompson et al., 2007a, 2007b] 
showed that the North American upper troposphere was greatly influenced by both 
LNOx and surface pollution, lofted via convection, that contained elevated 
concentrations of peroxyacetylnitrate (PAN), O3, hydrocarbons and NOx [Cooper et 
 
 
 
7 
al., 2006; Singh et al., 2007]. These measurements indicated large amounts of NOx in 
the upper troposphere and suggested that the lightning NOx source is far larger than 
anticipated [Singh et al., 2007]. Further studies from the same campaign found that 
lightning NO was responsible for 60%–80% of upper tropospheric NOx and 15%–
20% of upper tropospheric ozone over the eastern United States during the 
summertime [Hudman et al., 2007, 2009; Pfister et al., 2008; Cooper et al., 2009, 
Allen et al., 2010, 2012]. 
Hudman et al. [2009] found that during the INTEX-A period the hemispheric 
tropospheric O3 burden was enhanced with comparable contributions from 
anthropogenic and lightning NO emissions over North America. Modeling of the 
horizontal and vertical distribution of LNOx is highly uncertain. In the study by 
Hudman et al. [2007], the GEOS-Chem standard simulation greatly underestimated 
NOx in the UT. After increasing the lightning NO production to 500 mol flash−1, 
GEOS-Chem simulated NOx was still low biased. Similarly, Bousserez et al. [2007], 
Pierce et al. [2007],  Fang et al. [2010], and Allen et al. [2010] underestimated upper 
tropospheric NOx using the MOCAGE, RAQMS, MOZART and GMI chemical 
transport models (CTMs) (all with different lightning schemes), respectively. Using a 
completely different approach, Ott et al. [2010] found that using a 500 mol flash−1 
LNOx source produced the best comparison between NOx in cloud-resolved model 
simulations and storm anvil observations in the midlatitudes and subtropics.

2.3  Radiative Forcing of Tropospheric Ozone 
 Ramaswamy et al. [2001] defines radiative forcing for tropospheric O3 as the 
net downward flux (both the longwave and the much smaller shortwave contribution) 
at the tropopause due to the anthropogenic increase in tropospheric O3 from 
preindustrial times. The global annual average present-day radiative forcing 
(stratospheric adjusted) due to tropospheric O3 is +0.35 [0.25 to 0.65] W m−2 as 
estimated by climate simulations (Figure 1). If the stratospheric temperatures are not 
readjusted to radiative equilibrium, then the forcing is called the instantaneous 
radiative forcing. Other studies [e.g.,  Ramanathan et al., 1989; Aghedo et al., 2011] 
use a more fundamental definition of radiative forcing, which is defined as the change 
in the radiative fluxes at the top of the atmosphere. 
Through production of tropospheric O3, NOx emissions lead to a positive 
radiative forcing of climate (warming), but by increasing the concentration of OH, 
they reduce the levels of CH4, providing a negative forcing (cooling) that partly 
offsets the O3 forcing [Derwent et al., 2008]. Because of the long lifetime of CH4 
(~10 years) relative to the length of our simulations, the cooling effect of CH4 is 
neglected in our study. 
As discussed in several previous studies [e.g., Lacis et al., 1990; Gauss et al., 
2003] estimation of radiative forcing of tropospheric O3 depends on the spatial and, 
most importantly, the vertical distribution of O3 within the entire troposphere and 
lower stratosphere. Ozone increases (in terms of molecules added) near the 
tropopause are radiatively most efficient. Aghedo et al. [2011], using direct 
observations of infrared radiance at high spectral resolution by the Tropospheric 
 
 
 
9 
Emission Spectrometer (TES) instrument, derived a satellite-based estimate of the 
outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) sensitivity to ozone variations, the so-called 
instantaneous radiative forcing (IRF) kernels. These IRF kernels represent the 
sensitivity of OLR to the vertical and spatial distribution of ozone under all sky 
conditions [Worden et al., 2011]. Their results indicate that OLR is most sensitive to 
changes in middle tropospheric ozone (near 400 hPa) over the tropics and 
midlatitudes with large values of IRF kernel (0.5 mW m−2 ppbv−1) located between 
650–200 hPa, which corresponds to a region of lightning enhanced ozone. This 
midtropospheric sensitivity is a consequence of change in volume mixing ratio 
concentrations having a larger effect on total column in the middle troposphere than 
at the upper troposphere [Aghedo et al., 2011]. Choi et al. [2009] showed that this 
midtropospheric and upper tropospheric enhancement of ozone due to LNOx has a 
greater impact on radiative fluxes than the lower tropospheric enhancement due to 
anthropogenic NOx over North America and western North Atlantic.

uncertainty range and a level of scientific understanding (LOSU). The value 
uncertainties represent the 5 to 95% (90%) confidence range, and are based on 
available published studies; the LOSU is a subjective measure of structural 
uncertainty and represents how well understood the underlying processes are 
[IPCC, 2007].

3  Global Modeling 
3.1  Introduction 
We extend previous work focused on NOy export from North America during 
the INTEX-A period in summer 2004 by estimating the climate implications 
(radiative effects). The summer 2004 is compared to a meteorologically different 
summer (2002) using the University of Maryland Chemistry and Transport Model 
(UMD-CTM) [Park et al., 2004a, 2004b]. Godowitch et al. [2008], using the 
Community Multiscale Air-Quality (CMAQ) model, showed that reduced NOx 
emissions from power plants [Frost et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2006] caused substantial 
decreases in NOx concentrations aloft (300–1100 m) and in ground level daily 8 h O3 
maxima between the summers 2002 and 2004. Sites downwind of the emission-rich 
Ohio River Valley (ORV) region (i.e., Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, Kentucky, 
Indiana and Illinois) experienced the greatest decreases in daily 8 h O3 maxima 
between 2002 and 2004. Interestingly, Godowitch et al. [2008] found that meteoro-
logical effects had greater impact on O3 than those from emission changes over the 
region north of the Ohio River (Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Wisconsin and Michigan). In 
particular, temperature and moisture parameters were considerably different in 
summer 2004 than 2002. Average maximum temperatures were substantially cooler 
in the northeastern United States (U.S.), by as much as 3°C–5°C, during summer 
2004 [Godowitch et al., 2008]. Meteorology over northeastern NA during summer 
2004 was dominated by persistent low pressure, and there were increased synoptic 
disturbances relative to summer 2002 [Thompson et al., 2007a, 2007b; Büker et al., 
 
 
 
12 
2008]. The number of cold frontal passages over the northeastern United States was 
above average in summer 2004 [Fuelberg et al., 2007]. As we estimate later the 
increase in LNOx emissions (due to more frequent lightning in summer 2004 than in 
2002) is at least a factor of 2 larger than the decrease in ANOx emissions (due to 
power plant NOx reductions). 
In addition, we analyze the impact of the North American Monsoon. The 
monsoon region of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico does not 
have large ANOx emissions but has a large increase in LNOx emissions after the onset 
of the monsoon [Ridley et al., 1994]. Much of the LNOx becomes trapped in the UT 
above the Gulf of Mexico, the southern United States and Mexico—the major NA 
lightning region [Li et al., 2005; Cooper et al., 2006]—where conditions are 
favorable for O3 production. On the basis of rainfall statistics over the southwestern 
United States (Arizona and New Mexico) and northwestern Mexico, 2004 is 
considered a weak monsoon year and 2002 is a near-normal or slightly weak 
monsoon year (daily climatology available at ftp://ftp.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/precip/-
wd52ws/us-mex/). 
For both summers, we quantify the NA contribution to tropospheric O3 by 
conducting sensitivity simulations with either anthropogenic or lightning emissions 
over North America shut off. In section 3.2, we describe the updated UMD-CTM, 
which has undergone major revision since Park et al. [2004a] and lightning 
simulations performed for this study. Section 3.3 includes model comparisons with 
aircraft, ozonesonde, satellite and ground-based measurements. We determine the 
model biases for O3, NOx and other trace gases. We then discuss the summer-to-
 
 
 
13 
summer variability of lightning and the radiative impact of O3 produced from NA 
anthropogenic and lightning emissions in the outflow region. The results are 
summarized in section 3.4. 
3.2  Model Description 
The UMD-CTM was described in detail in Park et al. [2004a]; here we 
describe it briefly in terms of the experimental design. The horizontal resolution of 
the model is 2° × 2.5°. From the surface to 9.3 hPa, there are 14 sigma layers and 17 
constant pressure layers with a sigma-pressure transition (at 177 hPa) near the 
tropopause. The UMD-CTM is driven by assimilated meteorological fields from 
version 4 of the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS-4) of the NASA Global 
Modeling and Assimilation Office. Specifically, we use the GEOS-4 CERES (Clouds 
and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System) reanalysis (http://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/-
research/merra/sci_archive/climate.php). Convection in GEOS-4 [Bloom et al., 2005] 
is represented by two parameterizations: deep convection follows Zhang and 
McFarlane [1995], while shallow convection is based on work by  Hack [1994]. 
Moist convective transport in the UMD-CTM is parameterized using updraft, 
downdraft, entrainment and detrainment fields from the GEOS-4 CERES reanalysis. 
Turbulent mixing is calculated through a fractional mixing scheme [Allen et al., 
1996]: during a CTM time step (15 min) 20% of the mass in each model layer within 
the BL is mixed completely throughout the BL. Stratospheric O3 flux into the 
troposphere is controlled through the synthetic O3 (Synoz) scheme [McLinden et al., 
 
 
 
14 
2000] as in work by Park et al. [2004a]. The Synoz-based flux is set to 
475 Tg O3 yr−1 for both years following McLinden et al. [2000]. 
We use the same chemical mechanism as in the work by Park et al. [2004a] 
but with updated rate constants based on work by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory 
[2006]. We implemented the parameterization of quantum yields to update the 
photolysis rates for acetone on the basis of work by  Blitz et al. [2004]. The wet 
deposition scheme [Liu et al., 2001] includes contributions from scavenging in 
convective updrafts and rainout and washout from convective anvils and large-scale 
precipitation, and it allows for reevaporation. 
Table 1 identifies the modeling scenarios used to isolate the impacts of 
anthropogenic emissions, lightning and their summer-to-summer variability on O3 
concentrations. Initial conditions for O3 were obtained from NASA’s Global 
Modeling Initiative Chemistry and Transport Model (GMI CTM) [Douglass et al., 
2004] driven by meteorological input from the Finite Volume General Circulation 
Model (FVGCM) with several-year spin-up. Initial conditions for other species were 
obtained from a reduced 4° × 5° simulation of 1985 with the UMD-CTM by Park et 
al. [2004a] in the troposphere and from the GMI CTM in the stratosphere. The 
meteorological fields from the FVGCM do not correspond to a particular year.

3.2.1  Anthropogenic Emissions 
In 1998, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a regulation 
to reduce the interstate transport of NOx and ground level O3 in the eastern United 
States [Environmental Protection Agency, 2005]. This rule, commonly known as the 
NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) Call, started to be implemented in 2003 and 
required substantial power plant NOx emission reductions in 22 eastern states [Frost 
et al., 2006] with full implementation of controls to be completed by the summer 
2004 O3 season. In 2000, according to EPA’s National Emission Inventory (NEI) and 
 
 
 
16 
the Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR), U.S. power 
generation accounted for one quarter (1.5 Tg N) of national ANOx emissions 
(5.9 Tg N). Other major sources included road transport (1.9 Tg N), international 
shipping (0.6 Tg N) and air transport (0.3 Tg N). 
Global anthropogenic emissions in the model are as described by Park et al. 
[2004a] unless otherwise specified. Monthly power plant NOx emissions from the 
United States are taken from Continuous Emission Monitoring System (CEMS). 
These direct measurements represent one of the most accurate parts of the U.S. 
emission database (http://www.epa.gov/airmarkets/emissions). All other anthro-
pogenic emissions are from EDGAR 3.2 Fast Track 2000 (available at 
http://themasites.pbl.nl/tridion/en/themasites/edgar/emission_data/edgar_32ft2000/do
cumentation/index-2.html) [Olivier and Berdowski, 2001; Olivier et al., 2005]. 
Because of EPA’s SIP Call, NOx emitted from ORV power plants decreased on 
average by 50% between the summers 2002 and 2004. Overall, the NOx SIP Call 
resulted in a 10% reduction in total ANOx emissions from the CONUS. 
The power plant NOx emissions are released from tall stacks (average stack 
height is 76 m) in plumes with considerable buoyancy (average release temperature is 
117°C). Stack emissions of NOx are injected into the second lowest model layer. All 
other anthropogenic emissions are injected into the lowest model layer. In the UMD-
CTM, the lowest levels are centered at approximately 50, 250, 600, 1100 and 1900 m 
above the local surface. 
We increase ANOx emissions in eastern China by 15% above the 2000 
EDGAR NOx emissions for both summers since a large positive trend of tropospheric 
 
 
 
17 
NO2 was reported by  Richter et al. [2005] and  van der A et al. [2006] over the 
industrial areas in China. It should be noted that we hold all nonpower plant U.S. NOx 
emissions constant between 2002 and 2004; we also hold non-U.S. ANOx emissions 
of any type constant between the 2 years. The spatial distribution of the changes in 
surface NOx emissions from summer 2002 to 2004 over the United States used in the 
UMD-CTM simulations is shown in Figure 2.

2.5° resolution as represented in the UMD-CTM standard simulations. Negative 
values indicate ANOx emission decreases from 2002 to 2004. 
 
3.2.2  Lightning 
The annual global LNOx production is set to 5 Tg N yr−1, which is in the center of the 
currently accepted range of 2–8 Tg N yr−1 [Schumann and Huntrieser, 2007]. The 
lightning scheme follows Allen et al. [2010]. The LNOx production is assumed to be 
directly proportional to lightning flash rate FR as: 
 
 
 
18 
FR = G × L × (zmmu – zmmu0)k, 
where zmmu is GEOS-4 CERES upward cloud mass flux (at ~430 hPa). The lightning 
is thus colocated with the convective transport in the CTM. FR is set to zero for zmmu 
< zmmu0. We use zmmu0 = 0.57 kg m−2 min−1 as in the work by Allen et al. [2010] 
with k = 2, thus assuming that the FR is a quadratic function of zmmu; k = 2 gives 
more realistic day-to-day variability in model flash rates, decreases biases and 
improves correlations with respect to observed flash rates than k = 1. Using 
observations from the spaceborne Optical Transient Detector/Lightning Imaging 
Sensor (OTD/LIS) [Boccippio et al., 2002; Christian et al., 2003; Mach et al., 2007] 
and from the ground-based National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) 
[Cummins et al., 1998; Orville and Huffines, 2001], we scale lightning flash rates 
(FR) globally (G) and locally (L) so the model flash rates per grid box match the 
NLDN and/or OTD/LIS observed data sets on a monthly basis (details in the work by 
Allen et al. [2010], who scaled FR to match the global OTD/LIS v2.2 climatology). In 
the vertical, we partition lightning NO emissions on the basis of the modeling studies 
of  Pickering et al. [1998]. 
Table 1 shows three lightning simulations with the UMD-CTM. 
In L0, total flash rates (FR) derived from convective mass fluxes are adjusted 
to match the flash rates observed by OTD/LIS from space. We use Low Resolution 
Monthly Time Series (LRMTS) in the region between 35°S and 35°N and Low 
Resolution Annual Climatology (LRAC) elsewhere (available at 
http://thunder.msfc.nasa.gov/data). Since month-specific LIS observations are 
 
 
 
19 
available only south of 35°N, simulation L0 does not account for summer-to-summer 
variability of NA lightning poleward of 35°N. 
In L1, in addition to the L0 approach, over the CONUS, the flash rates derived 
from convective mass fluxes are adjusted to match the monthly average NLDN-based 
IC (intra-cloud) + CG (cloud-to-ground) flash rates (details are below). L1 is called 
“standard simulation.” 
In L2, in addition to the L1 approach, NO production per flash over the NA 
midlatitudes (25°N−50°N) is increased by a factor of 2 to 480 mol flash−1, which 
nearly matches the estimates of Ott et al. [2010] derived from cloud-resolved 
modeling and of Hudman et al. [2007] used in their improved GEOS-Chem 
simulation of the INTEX-A period. 
When determining the NLDN-based IC + CG flash rates (simulations L1 and 
L2), we remove NLDN flashes with peak currents between 0 and 20 kA, since they 
are assumed to be IC in character [Biagi et al., 2007]. We only use data over the 
CONUS for scaling as the NLDN detection efficiency drops off rapidly beyond 
300 km from shore. The NLDN underwent a system-wide upgrade during 2002 
[Cummins et al., 2006]. The mean preupgrade detection efficiency over the CONUS 
was ~85%. After this upgrade, which began in spring 2002, the NLDN had a 
detection efficiency of 90%–95% over the CONUS. For summer 2004, we thus use a 
detection efficiency of 93%. In order to estimate the detection efficiency for summer 
2002, we average the preupgrade value derived from Cummins et al. [1998, Figure 9] 
and postupgrade value of 93%. To obtain the total IC + CG flash rates, we multiply 
the detection efficiency-adjusted NLDN CG flashes by Z + 1, where Z is the IC/CG 
 
 
 
20 
ratio. Boccippio et al. [2001] constructed a 0.5° × 0.5° daily climatology of Z ratios 
(not year specific), by using observations of NLDN CG flashes and OTD/LIS total 
(IC + CG) flashes. In our study, we smooth their Z composite with a 7.5° moving 
boxcar, calculate the monthly averages and interpolate onto the 2° × 2.5° UMD-CTM 
grid. Before smoothing, we exclude grid boxes with Z > 12 as these values are 
anomalous [Boccippio et al., 2001]. 
To compare the lightning sources in our simulations with other investigators, 
we summarize the lightning NO emissions over the CONUS and adjacent coastal 
areas during INTEX-A (1 July to 15 August 2004) in Table 2. Simulations L0, L1 and 
L2 yield LNOx emissions of 0.16 Tg N, 0.25 Tg N and 0.50 Tg N, respectively. 
Hudman et al. [2007, 2009], using a cloud top height-based flash rate scheme and 
assuming 500 NO mol flash−1, obtained a LNOx emission of 0.27 Tg N over the same 
areas for that period. They noted that their flash rates were biased low with respect to 
NLDN-based flash rates (assuming an IC/CG ratio of 3). Adjusting for this bias, they 
obtained a best estimate of 0.45 Tg N for the lightning NO source; however, they did 
not use this in their model simulations. Jourdain et al. [2010], with their GEOS-Chem 
simulation with NLDN-based flashes and an assumed production of 520 NO mol 
flash−1, obtained a source of 0.28 Tg N for July 2006. Extrapolating to 1.5 months 
gives 0.42 Tg N, which is close to the bias-adjusted estimate by Hudman et al. [2007] 
for 2004. Allen et al. [2010], using the GMI CTM, reported 0.17 Tg N in their 
standard simulation and 0.34 Tg N in their simulation with doubled lightning NO 
production (480 mol flash−1). They scaled to OTD/LIS climatology rather than 
NLDN-based flash rates. The magnitude of lightning source in our standard 
 
 
 
21 
simulation (L1) nearly matches the one used by Hudman et al., while the L2 source 
(0.50 Tg N) is close to their NLDN-based estimate of the source. 
It is noteworthy that the 50% increase in CONUS LNOx emissions between 
2002 and 2004 more than offsets the ANOx emission decreases due to the NOx SIP 
Call. By applying this 50% increase to L1 and L2 sources above, we obtain estimates 
of 0.13 and 0.25 Tg N, respectively, for the LNOx emission changes from the same 
areas and time period as above. These estimated LNOx emission increases are at least 
a factor of 2 larger than the corresponding decrease of 0.06 Tg N in ANOx emissions 
due to the NOx SIP Call (the ANOx emissions from the CONUS were reduced from 
0.57 Tg N to 0.51 Tg N) during the same time period. Of course the impact of the 
ANOx emissions changes is most noticed near the surface while the impact of the 
LNOx emissions changes is most important in the UT.

3.2.3  Biogenic Emissions 
Isoprene emissions used in the UMD-CTM simulations come from monthly 
average hourly emissions calculated by the Model of Emissions of Gases and 
Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN) from standard case for summer 2003 [Guenther et 
al., 2006]. One of the most important meteorological factors in determining the 
isoprene emissions is the temperature. Pacifico et al. [2009, Figure 4] shows that a 
1°C temperature change can increase isoprene emissions by 15% for standard 
conditions (25°C–35°C). Temperatures in the region of high isoprene emissions were 
similar during summers 2002, 2003 and 2004 (Figure 3). Outside this region, 
maximum temperatures in 2002 exceeded maximum temperatures in 2004 by 1°C–
5°C likely leading to more emissions in 2002 than in 2004. Hogrefe et al. [2004], in 
an isoprene sensitivity simulation with CMAQ, showed that summertime 8 h O3 
changed by < 3 ppbv at locations within the domain (the eastern and central part of 
the United States) when isoprene emissions were increased by 20%–50% 
corresponding to maximum temperature increases of 1.5°C–3.5°C. Nolte et al. 
[2008], in another isoprene sensitivity simulation with CMAQ, showed that 
summertime 8 h O3 increased by 1 ppbv or less over most of the CONUS, when 
isoprene emissions were increased by 25%. Therefore, the use of the same isoprene 
emissions for 2002 and 2004 is likely to have only a minor impact on conclusions 
from this study.

Changes in GEOS-4 CERES temperatures, used in the UMD-CTM simulations, 
from summer 2002 to 2004 are smaller than the observed temperature changes 
shown in this figure. The mean GEOS-4 CERES temperature change from 
summer 2002 to 2004 over the region of high isoprene emissions (28°N–40°N 
and 74°W–96°W) is −1.5°C. Isoprene emissions used in the UMD-CTM 
simulations are from summer 2003.

3.2.4  Biomass Burning 
Biomass burning emissions south of 48°N were derived from the Global Fire 
Emissions Database Version 2 (GFEDv2) [van der Werf et al., 2006]. This data set 
prescribes emissions of total carbon as well as CO, CH4 and NOx. For other species, 
the total carbon emissions are converted to dry matter burned assuming a biomass 
carbon fraction of 0.45. Emission factors from Andreae and Merlet [2001] are then 
applied to estimate nonmethane hydrocarbon emissions. Factors are provided 
separately for savannah/grassland, tropical forest, extratropical forest and agricultural 
burning. Poleward of 48°N, we use emissions derived from Boreal Wildfire 
Emissions Model (BWEM) [Kasischke et al., 2005] for summer 2002 and GFEDv2 
emissions for summer 2004 (BWEM emissions for 2004 are unavailable). Land cover 
classification is derived from MODIS data [Hansen et al., 2000; Friedl et al., 2002]. 
The GFEDv2 database uses the CASA model to estimate fuel loads [van der 
Werf et al., 2003] and a burned area database derived from MODIS observations 
[Giglio et al., 2006] to estimate monthly biomass burning emissions on a 1° × 1° grid. 
For this study, MODIS active fire data [Justice et al., 2002] are used to calculate a 
daily perturbation for each 1° × 1° grid cell. This perturbation function is then applied 
to GFEDv2 emissions to obtain daily estimated emissions without altering monthly 
emissions, similar to the approach used by Heald et al. [2003]. This approach has 
been demonstrated to improve the accuracy of atmospheric simulations as opposed to 
using monthly-averaged emissions [Hyer et al., 2007; Roy et al., 2007]. Biomass 
burning data at 1° × 1° resolution are smoothed with a 7 day moving average to 
reduce the effect of a periodic bias associated with the polar orbit of MODIS [Heald 
 
 
 
26 
et al., 2003] and are regridded onto the 2° × 2.5° UMD-CTM grid. Biomass burning 
emissions are injected below 1.5 km outside the tropics and below 0.5 km within the 
tropics (in vertical, both uniformly distributed by mass). 
3.2.5  Radiative Forcing Calculation 
IPCC [2007] defines radiative forcing for tropospheric O3 as the change in net 
downward flux (both the longwave and the much smaller shortwave contribution) at 
the tropopause due to the anthropogenic increase in tropospheric O3 from 
preindustrial times. While the IPCC definition only considers anthropogenic changes, 
in general, both anthropogenic and natural O3 contribute to instantaneous radiative 
forcing (i.e., reduction in the outgoing longwave radiation). In our study, we consider 
the instantaneous radiative forcing of O3 produced from anthropogenic emissions and 
lightning NO emissions separately and compare their relative effects during long-
range transport of trace gases from North America. 
We calculate the longwave (980–1100 cm−1 band) contribution of the net 
downward Radiative Flux at the tropopause for clear sky conditions (for brevity we 
refer to this as RF) from O3 enhanced by anthropogenic emissions and lightning. RF 
serves as a measure of the extra heat (in W m−2) input into the troposphere due to 
changes in O3 (before stratospheric temperatures are adjusted to the radiative 
equilibrium). We use the radiative transfer model from Chou et al. [2001]. Thermal 
infrared radiatively active constituents include N2O, CH4, CFC11, CFC12, CFC22, 
H2O, CO2, O3 and background aerosol. Vertical distributions of O3 are calculated by 
the UMD-CTM. Distributions of the other optically active constituents are held 
 
 
 
27 
constant with respect to time. Water vapor and temperature profiles and skin 
temperatures are prescribed from the GEOS-4 CERES reanalysis. 
3.3  Results 
In North America, O3 concentrations and outflow are affected by both 
emission reductions and changes in meteorology [Godowitch et al., 2008]. To 
quantify the impact of changes in meteorology and associated lightning, we use the 
UMD-CTM to simulate the summers of 2002 and 2004. Because of the wide 
availability of observations (INTEX-A), we use the summer 2004 as a reference year 
to evaluate the model performance with regard to lightning and implementation of 
pollution controls (NOx SIP Call). We conduct three lightning simulations L0, L1 and 
L2 (Table 1) to account for current uncertainty in the simulation of lightning NO 
emissions and its relative role in the long-range transport of trace gases with respect 
to anthropogenic emissions. 
3.3.1  Differences Between Summers 2002 and 2004 
Large summertime flash rates over the CONUS enhance the NA upper 
troposphere and outflow region with NOx. Figure 4 shows the time series of NLDN-
based total lightning over the CONUS in summer 2002 and 2004. Because of 
numerous thunderstorms in early summer 2004 (1 June to 17 July), lightning flash 
rates over the CONUS were about 50% higher compared to early summer 2002. In 
late summer (18 July to 31 August), total flash rates over the CONUS in 2004 were 
similar to those in 2002. Additionally, the onset of the North American Monsoon over 
 
 
 
28 
the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico for both years occurred in 
mid-July [Li et al., 2004; Gao et al., 2007]. Finally, there were contrasting patterns of 
vertical transport in early and late summer in the BL (Figure 5). In early summer, 
there was 10%–40% more convective lofting in 2004 than in 2002 over the ORV and 
much of the eastern, central and southern United States, with less lofting over New 
England. In late summer, there was less lofting over the central and southern United 
States in 2004, with more lofting over New England. Therefore, we break our 
analysis into two periods: early summer (1 June to 17 July) and late summer (18 July 
to 31 August). 
Figure 6 shows GEOS-4 surface temperatures and winds at ~5.5 km above the 
local surface. A prominent feature of the circulation over the United States is the 
strong low-level jet transporting air and moisture from the Gulf of Mexico to the 
central United States up to ~45°N (not shown). At ~5.5 km, a strong anticyclone 
dominates the south-central and southwestern United States, consistent with 4 year 
climatology shown in the work by  Li et al. [2005]. The anticyclonic circulation has 
important implications for the fate of convective outflow over the United States, as 
we discuss later. In addition to the upper-level anticyclone, the northward expansion 
of the subtropical Bermuda High in the late summer influences the winds along the 
east coast of the United States. In 2004, especially during early summer, enhanced 
westerlies over the eastern United States (Figure 6b), in combination with enhanced 
BL lofting (Figure 5b), promoted outflow of anthropogenic pollution from North 
America. 
 
 
 
29 
Figure 7 shows the spatial pattern of NLDN-based IC + CG flashes during 
early summer 2002 and 2004. Higher flash rates were detected over most of the U.S 
in early summer 2004 compared to 2002: a factor of 2–4 increase over the Plains 
(Colorado, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma and northern Texas) and a factor of 1.5–2 
increase over the southern United States and parts of the ORV (southern Illinois, 
Indiana and Kentucky). The mean IC + CG flash rates over the CONUS were 8.30 
flash s−1 and 12.94 flash s−1 in early summer 2002 and 2004, respectively. 
In order to compare lightning flash rates (IC + CG) observed from space and 
detected from the NLDN, we construct the time series shown in Figure 8. This 
comparison presents the sums over the CONUS south of 35°N as derived from 
NLDN and LIS observations. Both the NLDN- and LIS-time series agree that June 
and July of 2004 had increased flash rates with respect to 2002 in this region. 
However, we find that more lightning was observed by the NLDN network (after 
adjustment by the IC/CG ratios) than by the LIS sensor during summers 2002–2005. 
Similarly, Jourdain et al. [2010] found that NLDN-based flash rates (assuming an 
IC/CG ratio of 3) over the CONUS (25°N–50°N) in July 2006 were about 40% higher 
than OTD/LIS flash rates. Over the CONUS south of 35°N, the summertime IC/CG 
ratios average 3.17 (when the grid boxes are weighted by the CG flash rates during 
2002–2004). While we do not have a reason to believe that IC/CG ratios are 
overestimated, if we decrease this mean summertime IC/CG ratio from 3.17 to 1.41, 
then the mean combined flash rates (IC + CG) derived from the NLDN would be 
consistent with the ones derived from the LIS. In our analysis, we exclude weak 
positive flashes (peak current < 20 kA) from the NLDN data. It should be noted that 
 
 
 
30 
removing only 0–10 kA flashes, as done by Boccippio et al. [2001], would require the 
summertime IC/CG ratios in this region to be decreased even more (to IC/CG = 1.24) 
for an agreement between NLDN- and OTD/LIS-based estimates of total flash rate. 
Therefore, model flash rates from simulation L1 (adjusted to NLDN data) exceed 
model flash rates from simulation L0 (adjusted to OTD/LIS) as shown in Figure 9 for 
early summer 2004. 
To summarize, the LIS-derived flash rates are nearly a factor of 2 lower than 
NLDN-based IC + CG flash rates south of 35°N, suggesting either (1) a fraction of 
NLDN flashes with negative peak currents are actually IC flashes, (2) the 
climatological IC/CG ratios are overestimated, or (3) LIS flash rates are 
underestimated. The latter two possibilities could be caused by uncertainties resulting 
from temporal and spatial undersampling by LIS [Boccippio et al., 2001]. The 
uncertainties of lightning detection by LIS are discussed in  Boccippio et al. [2002].

3.3.2  UMD-CTM Comparison With Observations 
3.3.2.1  Comparison With DC-8 in Situ Measurements During INTEX-A 
The INTEX-A field mission was conducted in summer 2004 (1 July to 15 
August 2004) and focused on quantifying and characterizing the summertime inflow 
and outflow of pollution over North America and the western Atlantic [Singh et al., 
2006]. INTEX-A was an important component of the coordinated multiplatform 
atmospheric chemistry field program called ICARTT [Fehsenfeld et al., 2006]. Here 
we use observations from NASA’s DC-8 aircraft. 
Regional lightning is the dominant source of upper tropospheric NOx and can 
lead to O3 increases of 10 ppbv or more in the UT [e.g., DeCaria et al., 2005]. Deep 
convection and lightning were important factors during INTEX-A [Bousserez et al., 
2007; Hudman et al., 2007; Singh et al., 2007]. Backward trajectories [Fuelberg et 
al., 2007] indicated that the DC-8 often sampled lightning-influenced air, which 
makes summer 2004 an ideal test bed for the lightning parameterization schemes. 
We use aircraft (DC-8) observations from all INTEX-A flights (with the 
exception of Flight 3 over the eastern Pacific) to determine the model biases for the 
three lightning simulations L0, L1 and L2. The individual flight track profiles are 
mostly stair step ascents and descents covering large horizontal regions. Details on 
flight paths are available in work by Singh et al. [2006]. Approximately half of the 
DC-8 samples were taken above 500 hPa (i.e., pressures < 500 hPa). We compare 
simulated vertical profiles output hourly from the UMD-CTM to 1 min merge aircraft 
measurements with a focus on the UT model biases. Following the correction 
 
 
 
36 
reported by  Ren et al. [2008], observed OH values are scaled up by a factor of 1.64. 
To ensure a regionally representative signal, we remove biomass burning plumes 
(HCN > 500 pptv, CH3CN > 225 pptv, or CO > 99th percentile), stratospheric air 
(O3/CO > 1.25 mol mol−1) and fresh pollution plumes (NOx/NOy > 0.4 mol mol−1, or 
if NOy is not available, NO2 > 4 ppbv and height < 3 km) from observations [Hudman 
et al., 2007]. This filtering excludes 8% (fresh pollution), 7% (biomass burning) and 
3% (stratospheric air) of the DC-8 data, including some samples with a strong 
lightning NO signal. While the stratospheric filter only removes 3% of samples, it has 
the largest impact on UT O3 biases. We sample the UMD-CTM at the locations and 
times of DC-8 filtered measurements using nearest neighbor values and interpolating 
to DC-8 heights. 
Figure 10 compares simulated and measured mean vertical distributions of 
NO, O3, CO, HNO3, NOx, OH, PAN and NOy. First, we analyze the UMD-CTM 
biases from the standard simulation (L1). Simulated NO and NOx profiles are C-
shaped, reflecting the partitioning of LNOx in the vertical [Pickering et al., 1998] and 
the anthropogenic source near the surface. Biases are largest in the UT. NO is 
underestimated throughout the column (30%–60% too low at 500–300 hPa and 80% 
too low above 300 hPa). NOx is underestimated by 20%–50% at 500–300 hPa and by 
80% above 300 hPa. The simulation with doubled lightning NO production per flash 
(L2) decreases biases for both NO and NOx to 10%–30% at 500–300 hPa and to 60% 
above 300 hPa; NOx agrees well with measurements below 300 hPa. 
O3 is overestimated in the lower troposphere by 15 ppbv, but this bias drops to 
9.6 ppbv above 500 hPa. Doubling the lightning NO source (simulation L2) increases 
 
 
 
37 
the bias to 12.3 ppbv. A 2–3 ppbv increase in upper tropospheric O3 resulting from a 
doubling of the source is also seen at IONS sites (Figure 11). The largest impact is 
seen near (Houston, Texas, and Huntsville, Alabama) and downwind (Wallops Island, 
Virginia, and Sable Island, Nova Scotia) of frequent thunderstorms. The UMD-CTM 
also shows a considerable low bias of 20% for CO throughout the column compared 
to aircraft measurements. CO is not sensitive to different LNOx sources. Upper 
tropospheric OH is highly sensitive to LNOx, which can be seen in the clear 
separation of the L0, L1 and L2 profiles. Observations indicate that OH 
concentrations increase with altitude; this slope is best captured in the L2 simulation. 
Mean absolute values of bias above 500 hPa are 0.11 pptv and 0.07 pptv for L1 and 
L2, respectively. 
HNO3 during INTEX-A was measured by the California Institute of 
Technology (CIT) and the University of New Hampshire (UNH). HNO3 is often 
depleted in the free troposphere because of scavenging during convection but can 
increase downwind of convection due to oxidation of NO2. HNO3 is highly sensitive 
to lightning; we see a larger change from L1 to L2 simulated profile than for PAN, 
consistent with Hudman et al. [2007] and Labrador et al. [2005]. Variability of HNO3 
in the lower troposphere is larger than in the UT and is associated with variability of 
NOx. The simulated HNO3 is generally overestimated with respect to both the CIT 
(Figure 10) and UNH (not shown) data sets. The CIT observed about 40% more 
HNO3 above 500 hPa than the UNH, leading to better agreement with the model. 
HNO3 is overestimated likely because of NOx oxidation being too rapid or wet 
removal being insufficient in the model or both. Overall, despite NOx 
 
 
 
38 
underprediction, NOy is overpredicted below 300 hPa because both PAN and HNO3 
are overestimated with respect to the in-situ measurements. Most of NOy high bias 
above 500 hPa is due to PAN overestimation (by up to 0.2 ppbv and 0.3 ppbv in the 
L1 and L2 simulations, respectively). NOx underestimation and NOy overestimation 
could indicate a fundamental problem with the UT NOy chemistry. Henderson et al. 
[2010] evaluated seven different chemical mechanisms. They found that each 
mechanism overestimates the rate at which NOx is converted to NOz (NOy – NOx), 
i.e., the rate at which NOx ages. They also suggested several updates and fixes to 
various mechanisms to slow down this conversion rate. 
In summary, doubling the lightning NO production per flash reduces NO, NOx 
and OH biases in the UT. However, it increases the biases for O3 and PAN slightly 
(by factors of 1.3 and 1.2, respectively) and for HNO3 and NOy substantially (factors 
of 2.8 and 2.0, respectively). In spite of increased O3 biases (by 2.7 ppbv above 
500 hPa, L1 versus L2), the NOx profile from the L2 simulation agrees well with DC-
8 measurements below 300 hPa but is low biased by 60% above 300 hPa. Because the 
lightning sources in L1 and L2 simulations bracket the emissions of other 
investigators (Table 2) and because of the mixed results from comparison with 
aircraft measurements during INTEX-A (NOx underestimated; NOy and O3 
overestimated) as to which lightning source is most realistic, we complement the L1 
results by examining the impact of doubled lightning NO production per flash (L2).

products (NOx, PAN, and HNO3). We use here HNO3 data obtained by science 
team from California Institute of Technology. Horizontal bars indicate standard 
deviations on the observations in each 50-hPa bin. The number of filtered

3.3.2.2  Comparison With IONS Ozone Soundings 
The INTEX Ozonesonde Network Study [Thompson et al., 2007b] provided 
several hundred ozonesonde launches throughout the continental United States and 
Canada during the INTEX-A period. In this section, we analyze the IONS soundings 
from the INTEX-A period. At IONS sites (Trinidad Head, Houston and the R/V R. H. 
Brown), soundings were made daily between noon and 1400 local time to capture 
overpasses of the Aqua and Aura satellites. The remaining stations launched midday 
1−3 times per week, except for Sable Island with 1900 local time launches 
[Thompson et al., 2007b]. In our analysis, we filter out mixing ratios > 200 ppbv in 
the measurements and model results to minimize the effects of extreme values, which 
are likely of stratospheric origin [Choi et al., 2008]. 
Figure 11 shows the mean vertical profiles of O3 as measured by IONS and 
calculated from L1 and L2 hourly output for July and August 2004. In general, the 
UMD-CTM overestimates the O3 concentration measurements. However, in the UT, 
the mean UMD-CTM profiles agree well (the best agreement is for Beltsville and 
R/V R. H. Brown) and are within one standard deviation of the mean ozonesonde 
soundings. Largest biases (9.8−11.6 ppbv above 500 hPa) are seen at Boulder, Sable 
Island and Wallops Island. Sounding-to-sounding variations in UT O3 are not well 
captured. The explained variance varies from near zero at Houston to 46% off the east 
coast, as indicated in Figure 11. 
The simulation with doubled lightning NO production per flash (L2) produces 
more O3 in the free troposphere. O3 biases are therefore increased in the L2 
simulation by up to 3.0 ppbv (above 500 hPa), depending on the site. The largest 
 
 
 
41 
impact is seen at the locations that had frequent thunderstorms (Houston and 
Huntsville) as well as in aged thunderstorm outflow (Wallops Island and Sable 
Island), whereas at Trinidad Head and Boulder, the doubling of lightning source has 
very little impact.

flash (L2: red dashed) UMD-CTM simulations are shown. Horizontal bars 
indicate standard deviations in each 50-hPa bin. The explained variances (r2)

bins above 500 hPa are listed in the bottom right corner of each plot.

3.3.2.3  Comparison With SCIAMACHY NO2 Columns 
The impact of reduced NOx emissions on NO2 columns in the ORV (the 
region dominated by power plants that had implemented controls) is evident from 
space [Kim et al., 2006]. Data from the high resolution (30 × 60 km2) SCIAMACHY 
instrument (Scanning imaging absorption spectrometer for atmospheric 
chartography), onboard ENVISAT, became available in August 2002. It detects the 
sunlight reflected from the Earth or scattered in the atmosphere [Richter et al., 2005]. 
In nadir mode, SCIAMACHY observes the total NO2 column from which the 
stratospheric column, as derived over the Pacific sector, is subtracted to get the 
tropospheric column. The measurements were screened to use only pixels with less 
than 30% cloud fraction. 
In Figure 12, we determine whether changes in satellite-observed and model-
calculated NO2 columns (L1 simulation) are consistent with the updated emission 
inventories. We sample the UMD-CTM by following daily satellite tracks (ENVISAT 
overpasses the ORV at 0930–1000 local standard time). The UMD-CTM tropospheric 
NO2 columns are calculated by integrating the columns from the surface to the 
GEOS-4 CERES tropopause. The UMD-CTM columns are interpolated in space and 
time to the SCIAMACHY pixels and times using the outputs at 1200 and 1800 UTC. 
We composite the observed and simulated columns onto a 0.54° × 0.70° grid, 
corresponding to approximately 60 × 60 km2 (Figures 12a, 12b, 12d, and 12e). By 
temporally averaging the UMD-CTM output at this resolution (each grid box includes 
~8 clear sky days during August 2002 and ~6 clear sky days during August 2004) we 
are able to obtain more detail than can be obtained from 2° × 2.5° UMD-CTM. 
 
 
 
43 
However, the UMD-CTM even when averaged in this fashion is unable to resolve the 
maxima observed by SCIAMACHY over polluted urban areas (e.g., Chicago). 
The observations from SCIAMACHY show that major NO2 plumes over the 
northeastern United States are of substantially smaller magnitude in 2004 than 2002, 
consistent with the emission reductions due to the NOx SIP Call. In August 2002, 
nearly one third of U.S. power plant NOx emissions were from the ORV region 
(larger box in Figure 12a), while in August 2004 they comprised less than one fifth 
due to implemented emission controls. CEMS data show that power plant NOx 
emissions from this region were reduced by ~50% between August 2002 and 2004. 
The observed NO2 columns over the ORV were reduced by 22% on average from 
2002 to 2004. A smaller observed reduction is expected because of transport from 
regions where emissions reductions were smaller and because SCIAMACHY detects 
all types of NO2, not just that resulting from power plant emissions. Similar 
reductions of 19% are seen in the UMD-CTM (Figures 12d and 12e). Reductions in 
observed columns were also seen over the northeastern United States (smaller box in 
Figure 12a), which is downwind of the ORV power plants. The modeled reductions in 
this region were 11%, while observed reductions were 20%. The difference in 
reductions between SCIAMACHY and the model in this region could indicate that 
NOx emissions from other sources also decreased between 2002 and 2004; however, 
this difference may also indicate that the medium-range transport of NO2 is 
underpredicted by the UMD-CTM. Gilliland et al. [2008] noted that CMAQ under-
estimated the response of O3 to changes in emissions partly because the transport of 
O3 and its precursors was underestimated. Godowitch et al. [2008] in a simulation 
 
 
 
44 
with CMAQ also underestimated the improvement in air quality between summers 
2002 and 2004. In 2002, there was a 2 ppbv low bias whereas 2004 had a 4 ppbv high 
bias in 8 h O3.

UMD-CTM is sampled at each SCIAMACHY pixel. Both observed (Figures 
12a and 12b) and modeled (Figures 12d and 11e) columns are composited to a 
0.54° × 0.70° (about 60 × 60 km2) grid which is close to the native resolution of 
SCIAMACHY. In the ORV region (indicated by the larger box on the left), 
SCIAMACHY observed reduction from 4.27 to 3.32 on average between 2002 
and 2004, whereas simulated columns were reduced from 4.24 to 3.43 (all 
values in units of 1015 NO2 molecules cm−2). (c, f) Relative change (%) between

3.3.2.4  Comparison With Ozone Observations From Ground-Based AQS Sites 
The AQS (Air Quality System) is an EPA database (http://www.epa.gov/-
ttn/airs/airsaqs) that provides ambient concentrations of air pollutants at monitoring 
sites, primarily in cities and towns. We use daily maximum 8 h O3 (8 h O3) as the 
metric for our comparisons, since it is important from a regulatory perspective. The 
2008 National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for 8 h O3 is 75 ppbv. 
Figure 13 shows time series of 8 h O3 from the ORV region. We see that the 
UMD-CTM captures well the periods with large day-to-day variability. Most of the 
variance (r2 > 0.5) in summer 2002 and in late summer 2004 is explained by the 
model. In early summer 2004, observed day-to-day variability is smaller, and the 
UMD-CTM is unable to capture these subtle changes in surface O3. It is likely that 
the correlation between simulated and observed 8 h O3 might be improved if daily 
CEMS data were used in the model instead of monthly CEMS data. In the ORV, 
8 h O3 is simulated with mean high biases of 16.5 ppbv and 24.0 ppbv in summer 
2002 and 2004, respectively. The difference between these biases is likely to decrease 
by up to 3 ppbv (see section 3.2.3) if isoprene emissions are allowed to respond to 
temperature variations. Despite this mean high bias, O3 concentrations at numerous 
AQS sites were slightly underpredicted during the highest O3 episodes that occurred 
in summer 2002. Similarly, in the rest of the eastern United States (not shown), the 
UMD-CTM captures the O3 variations reasonably well (r2 > 0.5) with biases of 10–
20 ppbv seen over the Great Lakes (Wisconsin and Michigan), New York State and 
New England and with 20–30 ppbv biases seen in the southern United States. 
Overprediction of surface O3 in the eastern United States during summer is common 
 
 
 
47 
in many CTMs. Reidmiller et al. [2009], as part of the Hemispheric Transport of Air 
Pollution project, 2007 (http://htap.org), showed that the mean multimodel (16 
CTMs) bias was 10–20 ppbv. Some of the bias is due to the spatial averaging of 
emissions in a model grid box; dilution of NOx emissions to a 2° × 2.5° grid leads to 
greater O3 production than at finer resolutions [Sillman et al., 1990; Park et al., 
2004b]. Additional uncertainty is introduced by the treatment of isoprene emissions 
(BEIS versus MEGAN) and isoprene-nitrate chemistry in chemical mechanisms. 
Overall, the combined effects of changes in meteorology and emissions had a 
great impact on 8 h O3 concentrations in the northeastern United States. Observed 
8 h O3 concentrations were reduced by 14 ppbv in the ORV on average from summer 
2002 to 2004. Reductions of 7 ppbv were seen in the UMD-CTM (sampled at the 
locations of the AQS sites).

and blue solid lines) indicates the standard deviation. The number of current

by black dotted lines. The UMD-CTM bias is listed in the bottom left corner of 
each plot. The explained variance r2 between time series of observed and 
simulated O3 is in the bottom right corner of each plot. 
 
3.3.3  Ozone Enhancements From NA Anthropogenic Emissions and Lightning 
We compare the relative effects of modeled O3 enhancements from NA 
anthropogenic emissions and NA lightning for summer 2004, focusing on long-range 
transport and continental outflow. Although not strictly true, because of the nonlinear 
response of O3 to NOx emissions, the lightning (anthropogenic) enhancement is 
 
 
 
49 
diagnosed as the difference between simulations with and without the LNOx (ANOx) 
source. These results are then compared to similar simulations for summer 2002, 
allowing us to quantify the impact of changes in meteorology and NA lightning 
between summers 2002 and 2004 on long-range transport and continental outflow as 
well as the relative radiative impact. 
Figures 14a, 14b, 14d, and 14e show the O3 enhancements from NA 
anthropogenic emissions and lightning in early summer 2004. Anthropogenic 
emissions produced the greatest O3 enhancements near the surface (up to 35 ppbv 
over the eastern United States, as seen in Figure 14a), whereas lightning had the 
greatest impact in the UT (up to 16 ppbv over the Gulf Coast and the western North 
Atlantic, as seen in Figure 14e). Hudman et al. [2009], using the GEOS-Chem, 
compared the O3 enhancements from NA anthropogenic emissions and lightning 
during INTEX-A. They also showed that the BL enhancements were mainly 
anthropogenic and that lightning had the greatest impact in the UT. Convectively 
lifted precursors and LNOx enhanced the O3 production, especially at higher altitudes. 
We see similar enhancements as Hudman et al. [2009] over North America and in the 
continental outflow, near-surface enhancements from anthropogenic emissions of 3–
5 ppbv over western Europe, and UT (400–200 hPa) enhancements from lightning of 
9–12 ppbv over the eastern subtropical Atlantic (with 9 ppbv contour reaching over 
Spain). In contrast with Hudman et al. [2009], we also examine the 2002 to 2004 
variations in O3 enhancements from lightning (Figures 14c and 14f). From 2002 to 
2004, there is an increase in the contribution of lightning to eastern U.S. O3, both near 
the surface (Figure 14c) and in the UT (Figure 14f). 
 
 
 
50 
Figure 15 shows the tropospheric O3 columns during early and late summer 
2004 and the enhancements from anthropogenic emissions and lightning NO 
emissions. In late summer 2004, the warm conveyor belt was especially active [Kiley 
and Fuelberg, 2006], enhancing the transport of anthropogenic O3 along the U.S. east 
coast. In addition, stronger southerly winds relative to early summer (Figure 6c versus 
Figure 6a) pushed the anthropogenic and lightning plumes to more northern latitudes. 
Maximum anthropogenic enhancements were ~11 DU, which represented ~21% of 
the total tropospheric column. Maximum lightning enhancements were ~9 DU 
(Figures 15c and 15f), which represented ~18% of the total tropospheric column. 
Doubling the LNOx source over North America in the UMD-CTM produces an 
additional 4 ppbv of O3 in the UT (400–200 hPa) compared to lightning 
enhancements from L1 simulation, thus adding ~2 DU to the tropospheric column. 
Doubled lightning (L2) produces therefore ~11 DU, which is the same as produced 
from anthropogenic emissions. The relatively small increase from ~9 to ~11 DU, 
when going from 240 NO mol flash−1 to 480 NO mol flash−1 is due to the nonlinear 
response of O3 enhancements to LNOx emissions. Similarly, in downwind regions 
over the northern Atlantic and western Europe, the early summer O3 enhancements in 
the L2 simulation exceed the L1 enhancements by only 33% despite a doubling of 
LNOx emissions from North America. In contrast,  Wu et al. [2009] found no 
significant nonlinearity of O3 response to anthropogenic NOx emissions in the 
downwind regions from North America. 
Shifting our focus to the summer-to-summer change, Figures 16a and 16c 
indicate substantial differences between 2004 and 2002 in O3 enhancements due to 
 
 
 
51 
lightning in the continental outflow, especially for early summer. Early summer 2004 
lightning contributed to 2–6 ppbv more O3 in the UT (400–200 hPa) over the 
subtropical North Atlantic, southern Europe and the Middle East when compared to 
2002 (Figure 14f), enhancing the tropospheric column by 1.0–3.5 DU. Over the 
subtropical North Atlantic (20°N–45°N), increased NA lightning (and changes in 
meteorology) between early summer 2002 and 2004 explain about two thirds of the 
increase in tropospheric O3 column between 2002 and 2004 (not shown). During late 
summer both years had similar lightning flash rates; however, meteorological 
conditions in 2004 were less favorable for O3 formation [see also Cooper et al., 2009; 
Allen et al., 2010] and led to 1–4 ppbv less O3 in the UT over the eastern United 
States than in 2002 (not shown). However, the tropospheric column over the eastern 
Atlantic, Europe and northern Africa had up to 1.2 DU more O3 from lightning in 
2004 than 2002 (Figure 16c), reflecting more efficient transport over the Atlantic in 
both early and late summer 2004. Later in the summer (both years), the LIS sensor 
observed enhanced flash rates over Mexico, indicating the increased lightning activity 
and deep convection associated with the North American Monsoon [Li et al., 2004; 
Gao et al., 2007]. Note the intensification of the O3 enhancement over Mexico and 
the convective outflow over the Gulf of Mexico in late summer (Figure 15c versus 
Figure 15f). 
To compare the impact of increased NA lightning (and changes in 
meteorology) between 2002 and 2004 with the impact of emission reductions 
resulting from the NOx SIP Call, we did a sensitivity simulation with 2002 NOx 
emissions (when power plant emissions were not as tightly regulated) and 2004 
 
 
 
52 
meteorology and lightning. While decreases in surface O3 layer over the eastern 
United States due to the NOx SIP Call were substantial, decreases in the tropospheric 
column were small (Figures 16b and 16d). Columns were reduced by < 0.5 DU due to 
the NOx SIP Call over the North Atlantic in both early and late summer (with the 
−0.1 DU contour reaching Spain, Italy and southern France). During the early 
summer in the region where the emission reductions (between 2002 and 2004) had 
the largest impact on O3 column over the North Atlantic (30°N–50°N), the increase in 
O3 column due to changes in lightning and meteorology exceeded the decrease due to 
reduced anthropogenic emissions by a factor of 7. In late summer, differences in flash 
rates between 2002 and 2004 were much smaller. Consequently, the late summer 
changes in O3 column due to changes in lightning and meteorology were also smaller 
in the second half of the summer, and the change in O3 column due to lightning and 
meteorology was comparable to the change due to reduced anthropogenic emissions 
but opposite in sign. Comparing the changes in surface O3 concentrations between 
early summer 2004 and 2002, we see that the reductions due to the NOx SIP Call 
were up to 5 ppbv with decreases of 1–3 ppbv downwind of the ORV region, while 
increased NA lightning NO emissions resulted in a 0.3–1.4 ppbv increase in surface 
O3 over the same regions (Figure 17). Unlike NA anthropogenic emissions, which 
continue to show a downward trend over recent years, there is no clear trend in 
lightning flash rate and the increases in Figure 17a are only a result of interannual 
variability. 
Ozone enhancements can be found downwind of NO2 enhancements: O3 
enhancements in Figures 15b, 15c, 15e, and 15f extend more eastward than 
 
 
 
53 
corresponding NO2 enhancements in Figure 18. The same is true for the summer-to-
summer changes (Figures 16a and 16c versus Figures 18d and 18h). 
Lightning enhancements are primarily in the UT, where previous studies [e.g., 
Lacis et al., 1990] have shown O3 to be most effective as a greenhouse 
gas.  Choi et al. [2009], using the regional chemistry transport model REAM for the 
period of June−July 2005, showed that in the immediate convective outflow, the 
radiative effects of O3 produced from LNOx were up to three times as large as those 
from anthropogenic emissions. In our analysis, we examine the larger-scale radiative 
impact (defined in section 3.2.5) due to O3 produced from anthropogenic emissions 
(RFanthro) and from lightning (RFLNOx). Figure 19 shows that RFanthro ranged from 
0.15–0.30 W m−2 in the continental outflow across the North Atlantic, whereas the 
RFLNOx ranged from 0.20–0.40 W m−2 (0.25–0.50 W m−2 for doubled LNOx source) 
over the same area in early and late summer 2004. The RFLNOx also exceeded RFanthro 
over southern Europe and northern Africa in both early and late summer 2004. We 
find that, in early summer 2004, the RFLNOx/RFanthro ratio ranged from 0.3 at higher 
latitudes of the North Atlantic to ~1.6 over the subtropical North Atlantic, with a 
maximum of 2.3 over the southern Gulf of Mexico (Figure 20). Doubling the LNOx 
source has the greatest impact on this ratio over the western subtropical North 
Atlantic, where the RFLNOx/RFANTHRO ratio increases from 1.6 to 2.1. 
We see the largest impact from lightning after the onset of the North 
American Monsoon (Figure 19e), which is reinforced by the upper-level anticyclone 
centered over Mexico [Cooper et al. 2009, Figure 2]. Although the RF due to 
lightning is greater in late than early summer in the immediate convective outflow 
 
 
 
54 
over Mexico and the Gulf of Mexico, it is slightly less over Europe and northern 
Africa in late summer 2004. This indicates that the convective outflow recirculated in 
this upper level anticyclone centered over Mexico in late summer, allowing more O3 
production over the southern United States and the Gulf of Mexico, as discussed 
by  Li et al. [2005], prior to transport across the Atlantic. 
The spatial pattern of summer-to-summer changes in RF (Figures 19c and 
19f) is similar to that of summer-to-summer changes in the tropospheric O3 column. 
The 50% increase in flash rate between early summer 2002 and 2004 over the United 
States corresponds to 30% increase in RF due to LNOx over the areas with 
enhancements exceeding 5 DU. The impact of power plant reductions on RF 
(diagnosed from the sensitivity simulation with 2002 NOx emissions and 2004 
meteorology and lightning) was much smaller than that seen in Figures 19c and 19f. 
The RF values over the North Atlantic decreased by < 0.01 W m−2 because of 
emissions reductions (not shown). Of course, the emission reductions were designed 
to address violations in ambient air quality and not to reduce tropospheric O3 columns 
and resulting changes in RF. 
In early summer 2004, mean normalized RF per unit of added O3 column, 
over the areas with enhancements exceeding 5 DU, is 0.027 W m−2 DU−1 due to NA 
anthropogenic enhancements and 0.047 W m−2 DU−1 due to NA lightning 
enhancements (average from L1 and L2 simulations). For comparison with previous 
studies we use Gauss et al. [2003], who used 11 different climate models to estimate 
the (longwave, clear sky) normalized instantaneous radiative forcing. They gave a 
range of 0.042–0.052 W m−2 DU−1 for the global annual averages of normalized 
 
 
 
55 
radiative forcing due to changes in tropospheric O3 between 2000 and 2100. The 
annual average of normalized radiative forcing due to increasing anthropogenic 
emissions over the next century is predicted to be greater than that due to present-day 
NA anthropogenic emissions and is comparable with RF due to NA lightning. 
Noteworthy is also  Worden et al. [2008], who, using TES (Tropospheric Emission 
Spectrometer) measurements for cloud-free ocean conditions, obtained an estimate of 
0.055 W m−2 DU−1 (annual mean from 45°S to 45°N) for the sensitivity to UT (500–
200 hPa) O3, thus providing an important observational constraint for both natural 
and anthropogenic O3.

3.3.4  Import and Export Fluxes 
We calculate the fluxes of NOx, NOy, CO and O3 across the western and 
eastern NA boundaries for early summer. These fluxes are summed along the 
longitudes 130°W (imports) and 65°W (exports) in the region between 25°N and 
60°N. We estimate NOy as the sum of the following oxidation products: NOx, NO3, 
N2O5, HONO, HNO3, HO2NO2, PAN and MPAN (methylperoxyacetyl nitrate). 
Figure 21a shows vertical profiles of NOx, NOy, CO and O3 fluxes averaged 
over early summer 2002 and 2004; 2002 imports exceeded 2004 imports for each 
species. Since we held the Asian anthropogenic emissions constant for both years, the 
decreased imports (by ~30%) in 2004 compared to 2002 were mainly due to the 
weaker jet stream over the Pacific. For example the peak zonal winds at 225 hPa were 
36 m s−1 and 32 m s−1 in 2002 and 2004, respectively, although it should be noted that 
the peak zonal winds do not represent the integrated effect of the entire wind field 
 
 
 
63 
over the Pacific. The reduced imports seen in 2004 compared to 2002 motivate us to 
calculate the difference between exports and imports, hereafter referred to as the net 
exports. This method allows us to estimate the efficiency of photochemistry over 
North America by removing the differences in what is imported from what is 
photochemically produced or emitted over North America. O3 soundings at the west-
coast site of Trinidad Head, CA, indicate that O3 imports are well simulated (Figure 
11 shows a good agreement of ozonesonde-measured O3 profiles with model-
calculated O3 profiles). 
NOx and NOy fluxes in this study are similar to those from  Choi et al. [2008], 
in which the authors estimated imports and exports from North America in spring 
2000 using the regional chemistry transport model REAM. They reported that in May 
2000, the NOx exports peak at 4 × 107 mol d−1. In our study, NOx exports peak at 2.1–
2.5 × 107 mol d−1 (in early summer 2002 or 2004, Figure 21a). This lower peak could 
be because of faster photochemical oxidation and slower wind speeds during summer. 
In addition, CEMS data show that NOx emissions from the United States were greater 
in 2000 than 2002 or 2004. North America is a net source of pollution in summer 
(exports greater than imports throughout the troposphere); this is partially due to 
stronger westerlies over the western Atlantic than over the eastern Pacific (Figure 6). 
The total O3 exports (summed from the surface to 100 hPa) were factors of 2 and 1.4 
larger than the total O3 imports in early summer 2004 and 2002, respectively, whereas 
in May 2000, the export-to-import ratio was close to 1 [Choi et al., 2008]. 
Figure 21b indicates that the net exports were larger in early summer 2004 
than in 2002. The areas to the left of the net export curves are proportional to the total 
 
 
 
64 
mass exported from North America. CO was exported at higher altitudes in 2004 
(Figure 21b) which along with enhanced westerlies (Figure 6) led to greater net 
export than in 2002. In order to determine if differences in biomass burning between 
2002 and 2004 had a substantial impact on net exports, we reran the UMD-CTM for 
early summer 2004 using 2002 biomass burning emissions. Net CO exports increased 
by 9%; the impact on other species was smaller. Because of stronger westerlies, 
enhanced lightning NO emissions over North America in summer 2004 than in 2002 
and a possible increase in O3 imported from stratosphere in 2004 (consistent with 
Thompson et al. [2007a]), net O3 exports were greatly enhanced in the UT compared 
to 2002. 
Despite reduced ANOx emissions due to the NOx SIP Call and cooler 
temperatures (Figure 6b) in 2004 relative to 2002, simulations with the UMD-CTM 
show greater anthropogenic exports in 2004 than in 2002 (Figure 22a). This was 
likely due to an efficient transport mechanism from North America: enhanced 
convective lofting over polluted areas (Figure 5b) and stronger westerlies (Figures 6b 
and 6d). Similarly, the exports of NOx, NOy and O3 due to lightning NO emissions in 
2004 greatly exceeded those seen in 2002 (Figure 22). 
Due to lofted pollution from the BL, ANOx exports peaked in the UT in both 
years. NOy exports due to anthropogenic emissions peaked in the lower troposphere. 
Increased lightning activity and stronger UT westerlies over the CONUS in early 
summer 2004 resulted in a factor of 2 greater LNOx exports than in 2002. In early 
summer 2004, anthropogenic emissions explain about 28% and 41% of the net NOx 
and NOy column exports, respectively, while lightning explains about 49%–67% and 
 
 
 
65 
34%–49% (the lower estimates corresponding to production of 240 NO mol flash−1 
and the upper estimates corresponding to production of 480 NO mol flash−1). The 
remaining 5%–23% of the net NOx, and 10%–25% of the net NOy, is from other NOx 
sources (biomass burning emissions and soil release) and the contribution from the 
north and south into NA. O3 exports due to anthropogenic emissions were a factor of 
1.6 larger than those due to lightning in 2004 (54 × 107 O3 mol d−1 compared to 33 
× 107 O3 mol d−1). However, in a sensitivity simulation with doubled LNOx source, 
this ratio decreases to 1.2 (O3 exports due to lightning increased by 33% to 44 × 107 
O3 mol d−1). This is consistent with the earlier result where doubled LNOx source 
over North America increased the lightning enhancements by ~33% in downwind 
regions compared to lightning enhancements from LNOx source in the standard 
simulation. In 2002, anthropogenic emissions contributed twice as much to the net O3 
export as lightning.

3.4  Summary 
This study illustrates the importance of interannual variations in meteorology 
and associated lightning for the variability of long-range transport and continental 
outflow. We conducted several simulations of summers 2002 and 2004 with the 
UMD-CTM driven by meteorological fields from the GEOS-4 CERES reanalysis. 
Summer 2004 had reduced power plant NOx emissions in the Ohio River Valley 
(resulting from the NOx SIP Call), more lightning, relatively cool temperatures and 
frequent synoptic disturbances over the contiguous United States compared to 
summer 2002. We used 2004 as a reference year to evaluate the UMD-CTM due to 
the valuable measurements that were obtained over the eastern United States and 
western North Atlantic during the INTEX-A science mission. Summer 2004 revealed 
great decreases in observed surface O3 concentrations over the northeastern United 
 
 
 
68 
States, especially downwind of the Ohio River Valley, the region with a high number 
of power plants that had implemented NOx controls. The satellite observations from 
SCIAMACHY clearly detected NO2 column decreases in this region. 
We also conducted several lightning sensitivity simulations. We assumed the 
lightning flashes are proportional to the square of convective mass fluxes and 
constrained to match the observations from OTD/LIS and from the NLDN. We found 
an inconsistency between LIS- and NLDN-based total flash rates over the CONUS 
south of 35°N: more lightning was observed by the NLDN network (after adjustment 
by the IC/CG ratios) than by the LIS sensor. For agreement between these two data 
sets, the summertime IC/CG ratios over this region would have to be decreased by a 
factor of 2. 
Like other global and regional CTMs, O3 in the UMD-CTM is overestimated 
by 15–25 ppbv at the surface and by up to 12 ppbv in the upper troposphere (500–
200 hPa) compared to aircraft and ozonesonde measurements. We found that the 
simulation with doubled lightning NO production (480 mol flash−1) agrees best with 
observed NOx; however, it increases the upper tropospheric high bias for O3 by 
~3 ppbv. Because of these mixed results, we complement the results from the 
standard simulation with the results from the simulation with doubled lightning NO 
production per flash. In the Ohio River Valley, the UMD-CTM showed similar 
reductions (19%) of tropospheric NO2 column as observed by SCIAMACHY (22%) 
between August 2002 and 2004, consistent with the emission reductions due to the 
NOx SIP Call. Simulations with the UMD-CTM showed reduced O3 concentrations at 
 
 
 
69 
the surface between the summers 2002 and 2004; however, these reductions were 
50% less than those seen in AQS observations. 
Lightning over the United States greatly enhances the North American 
outflow of O3. In early summer 2004, North American anthropogenic emissions 
produced the greatest O3 enhancements near the surface (up to 35 ppbv over the 
eastern United States), whereas lightning had the greatest impact in the upper 
troposphere (up to 16 ppbv for the standard and 20 ppbv for doubled LNOx source, 
over the Gulf Coast and the western North Atlantic). After the onset of the North 
American Monsoon, the impact of lightning was even greater (up to 18 ppbv for the 
standard and 22 ppbv for doubled LNOx source). RF (defined as net downward 
radiative flux at the tropopause for clear sky conditions) of 0.15–0.30 W m−2 due to 
O3 produced from anthropogenic emissions was seen in the continental outflow 
across the North Atlantic, extending to Europe and northern Africa, while RF due to 
O3 produced from lightning NO emissions was 0.20–0.40 W m−2 (0.25–0.50 W m−2 
for doubled LNOx source) over the same areas in early and late summer 2004. 
Lightning flash rates in early summer 2004 were 50% higher than in 2002 over the 
contiguous United States. RF due to lightning was nearly a factor of 2 larger in early 
summer 2004 than 2002 in the North American outflow region. The normalized RF 
per unit of added O3 column was 0.027 W m−2 DU−1 for anthropogenic enhancements 
and 0.047 W m−2 DU−1 for lightning enhancements. This is because of stronger 
radiative forcing efficiency of an upper tropospheric perturbation. 
Sensitivity simulation with reduced emissions due to the NOx SIP Call 
showed that the impact of emission reductions (between 2002 and 2004) on O3 
 
 
 
70 
column over the North Atlantic (30°N–50°N) was a factor of 7 smaller than the 
impact of changes in lightning and meteorology in early summer. Late summer 
changes in lightning had much smaller impact on O3 columns. 
Large differences between the two summers in horizontal winds and 
convection greatly modulated the changes in O3 concentrations. Simulations with the 
UMD-CTM show that despite reduced emissions due to the NOx SIP Call and cooler 
temperatures in 2004 relative to 2002, more O3 was exported from North America in 
2004 due to anthropogenic emissions than in 2002 because of enhanced lofting of 
polluted air from the boundary layer (in early summer) followed by stronger westerly 
winds over the main NOx source region in the eastern United States. O3 exports 
across the eastern NA boundary due to anthropogenic emissions were factor of 1.6 
larger than those due to lightning in 2004. However, the simulation with doubled 
lightning source reduces this ratio to only 1.2 indicating nonlinearity. Doubling the 
North American lightning NO source increased downwind ozone enhancements due 
to lightning NO emissions by one third.

4  Regional Modeling 
4.1  Introduction 
The findings from the previous chapter show that the O3 generated from 
lightning NOx is an important contributor to radiative forcing because of the upper 
tropospheric perturbation. 
Traditionally, the ozone distributions required for radiative forcing 
calculations are determined by coarse global chemistry transport models. In this 
chapter, we simulate the spatial and vertical distributions of O3 by using the regional 
air quality model WRF-Chem, in which chemistry is fully coupled with meteorology 
[Grell et al., 2005] and includes an interactive treatment of aerosols [Fast et al., 
2006]. In general, regional air quality and chemical transport models assume 
climatological profiles of ozone in their radiation schemes throughout the 
atmospheric column. In this chapter, the model O3 is incorporated into the radiation 
schemes, thus allowing heating rates from ozone to affect meteorological and 
chemical quantities, which we refer to as interactive ozone. We use the interactive 
ozone to investigate the magnitude of the radiative forcing due to lightning NO 
emissions in the WRF-Chem model. Our WRF-Chem simulations are driven by 
NASA’s MERRA reanalysis [Rienecker et al., 2011]. Initial and boundary conditions 
for chemical species are taken from NASA’s global chemical transport model GMI 
with combined stratospheric and tropospheric chemistry [Duncan et al., 2007, 2008]. 
To our knowledge, trace gases from GMI have not been used previously to drive 
regional air quality models before. 
 
 
 
72 
We use the lightning NO parameterization of Hansen [2011], which estimates 
total flash rates based on convective precipitation and mixed phase depth. This 
lightning scheme is expected to be available in the next annual release of WRF (2013) 
and is similar to the schemes of Allen et al. [2012] and  Koo et al. [2010] in that it 
places lightning NO emissions at the locations of model convection. However, this 
lightning parameterization also accounts for the lapse rate of storms by using mixed 
phase depth as an additional predictor of flash frequency. 
We conduct sensitivity simulations for July 2007 over the continental United 
States, a region with frequent summertime lightning. The simulations are performed 
with and without interactive O3 and with and without lightning NO emissions in order 
to explore impacts of ozone perturbations on OLR. In section 4.2, we describe the 
experimental set-up and evaluate the flash rate parameterization. We hypothesize that 
incorporating O3 into radiation schemes can improve the accuracy of radiative flux 
calculations. We focus on the longwave portion of the spectrum and conduct single 
column experiments for clear sky. In section 4.3, we explore this hypothesis with 
back of the envelope calculations with single column calculations for ozone 
perturbations in the upper troposphere. Section 4.4 includes WRF-Chem comparisons 
with ozonesonde and satellite measurements. We then discuss O3 enhancements from 
lightning and the impact on surface ozone. We include a comparison with satellite-
observed OLR, investigate the radiative effects of interactive O3 and calculate the 
radiative forcing of O3 generated from LNOx. Lastly, we estimate the export of 
reactive nitrogen from the contiguous United States. The results are summarized in 
section 4.5. 
 
 
 
73 
4.2  Model Description 
For the regional simulations we apply the Weather Research and Forecasting 
model with chemistry (WRF-Chem version 3.2.1) [Grell et al., 2005]. WRF-Chem 
represents the first community online-coupled model in the United States and 
provides the capability to simulate chemistry and aerosols from cloud resolving scales 
to regional scales [Zhang, 2008]. The chemistry component of WRF-Chem is fully 
consistent with the meteorological component (WRF); both use the same transport 
scheme, grid (horizontal and vertical), and physics scheme. Gas-phase atmospheric 
chemistry in this study is based on the CBM-Z mechanism [Zaveri and Peters, 1999], 
which uses 67 prognostic species and 164 reactions. Rates for photolytic reactions 
within CBM-Z are computed by the Fast-J scheme [Wild et al., 2000]. Aerosols are 
treated by the Model for Simulating Aerosol Interactions and Chemistry (MOSAIC) 
[Zaveri et al., 2008] using 4 sectional bins. Table 3 summarizes the WRF-Chem 
configuration options used in this study. 
Table 4 identifies the modeling scenarios used to isolate the impact of 
lightning NO emissions on O3 concentrations, as well as the impact of interactive O3 
on radiative fluxes. WRF-Chem is run at 36 km with 40 vertical levels extending up 
to 50 hPa with increased resolution in the boundary layer (12 levels in the lowermost 
1 km) and near the tropopause with a time step of 3 minutes. We composite a total of 
ten 90-hour forecasts that begin at 00 UTC 1 July and end at 18 UTC 31 July 2007. 
The model integrations are re-initialized at 00 UTC every third day, allowing an 18-
hour period for model spin-up (i.e., the first 18 hours of model output is excluded 
from analysis).

4.2.1  Meteorological and Chemical Initial and Boundary Conditions 
Meteorological initial and boundary conditions at 6 hour intervals were 
interpolated from NASA’s reanalysis MERRA (Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis 
for Research and Applications, https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/merra/) provided at 2/3° × 
1/2° resolution and 42 pressure levels by Global Modeling and Assimilation Office 
(GMAO) [Rienecker et al., 2011]. MERRA was generated with the NASA Global 
Earth Observing System (GEOS) atmospheric model and data assimilation system 
(DAS), version 5.2.0 [Rienecker et al., 2008]. Several studies have analyzed various 
aspects of the scientific quality of MERRA reanalysis, for example the work 
of  Bosilovich et al. [2011], who evaluated MERRA from an energy and water budget 
perspective. To run WRF with the Noah land surface scheme requires at least four 
levels of soil moisture and soil temperature. The soil moisture and temperature came 
from NCEP’s North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR), which is available at a 
 
 
 
76 
32-km resolution. The NARR data set is available at http://nomads.ncdc.noaa.gov/-
#narr_datasets and documented by Mesinger et al. [2006]. 
Chemical initial and boundary conditions for WRF-CHEM are interpolated 
from NASA’s Global Modeling Initiative (GMI) CTM [Duncan et al., 2007, 2008] 
driven by the same meteorology (MERRA reanalysis) as WRF-Chem. We ran the 
GMI-CTM at a horizontal resolution of 2° × 2.5° with 72 vertical levels with a lid at 
0.01 hPa. The GMI-CTM chemical mechanism includes 124 species, 322 chemical 
reactions and 81 photolysis reactions to simulate tropospheric and stratospheric 
chemistry. The tropospheric mechanism includes a detailed description of O3-NOx-
hydrocarbon chemistry [Bey et al., 2001] and has been updated with recent 
experimental data [Tyndall et al., 2001; Dunlea and Ravishankara, 2004]. The 
chemical mass balance equations are integrated using the SMVGEAR II algorithm 
[Jacobson, 1995]. Photolysis rates are computed using the Fast-JX radiative transfer 
algorithm [Bian and Prather, 2002]. 
While we do not attempt to do a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of 
using different initial and boundary conditions, since NARR is routinely used by the 
WRF community, we perform a sensitivity simulation driven by the NARR reanalysis 
and compare the WRF results between this and the MERRA driven simulation at two 
snapshot times from July 7 and July 8, 2007 (Figure 23). Compared to the NCEP 
Stage IV precipitation analysis derived from combination of radar and rain gauges 
(http://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/mmb/ylin/pcpanl/stage4/), the convective system 
from July 7 at 18 UTC over the southeastern United States is better represented in the 
simulation driven by the MERRA reanalysis. Although the location of the system is 
 
 
 
77 
missed by 200 km, the peak precipitation totals are well captured. Comparing the 
6 hour precipitation totals between the Stage IV estimates and amounts from 
simulations driven by WRF, we see that the areas where the amounts exceed 20 mm 
are approximately the same size (27,000 km2). The mean 6 hour accumulation from 
the simulation driven by MERRA is 35 mm over the regions where totals exceed 
20 mm, while the accumulation from the Stage IV estimate is 29 mm. The simulation 
driven by NARR fails to capture amounts > 20 mm. In addition, the convective 
system in the southwestern part of the WRF domain (northern Mexico) at 06 UTC on 
July 8 is captured only by the simulation driven by MERRA. Although this 
comparison includes only two snapshots, it shows the sensitivity of model convection 
to initial and boundary conditions. 
The initial and boundary conditions for WRF-Chem simulations with no 
lightning NO are obtained from the GMI-CTM simulation with global LNOx source 
turned off, and initial and boundary conditions for WRF-Chem simulations with 
lightning NO emissions are obtained from the GMI-CTM simulation with LNOx 
source turned on. The lightning parameterization in GMI-CTM is based on 
convective mass fluxes; model-calculated flash rates are constrained to match the 
geographical distribution of flash rates observed by OTD/LIS [Allen et al., 2010]. In 
the vertical, the lightning NO emissions are distributed on the basis of cloud resolved 
modeling studies of Ott et al. [2010]. 
The following species are obtained from the GMI-CTM: O3, carbon monoxide 
(CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), NO3, N2O5, HNO3, HNO4, peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), 
H2O2, formaldehyde, ethane, acetone, methanol, methylglyoxal and isoprene. Ethene, 
 
 
 
78 
toluene and cresol are not included in the GMI-CTM chemical mechanism. Initial and 
boundary conditions for these three species, as well as for SO2 and aerosol species, 
are obtained from global chemical transport model MOZART-4 (Model for Ozone 
and Related Chemical Tracers) [Emmons et al., 2010; Pfister et al., 2011], driven by 
meteorological fields from the NASA GMAO GEOS-5 model (fields available at 
http://www.acd.ucar.edu/wrf-chem/mozart.shtml).

Service have an observation range of 460 km, so Stage IV data does not include 
rain over oceans beyond this range, although the WRF simulations do.

4.2.2  Emissions 
The emission data sets were preprocessed by the Sparse Matrix Operator 
Kernel Emissions modeling system (SMOKE) version 2.7 [http://www.smoke-
model.org;  SMOKE, 2010]. In the first step we run WRF with no chemistry to 
prepare meteorological fields (e.g., surface temperature, radiation) required for 
emissions processing. These fields are then processed by SMOKE to create 
chemically speciated, and spatially allocated hourly emissions for WRF-Chem. We 
use the EPA 2005 National Emissions Inventory (NEI version 4.2) as input to 
SMOKE. A detailed description of the emissions inventory can be found at 
http://www.epa.gov/ttnchie1/emch/index.html. The NEI inventory includes onroad 
mobile source emissions estimated by the Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator 
[MOVES, 2010]. The SMOKE platform also includes the Biogenic Emissions 
Inventory System (BEIS version 3.14) used to generate meteorologically adjusted 
emissions from vegetation and soils. 
4.2.3  Lightning 
It is well known that lightning produces NOx as a result of the high 
temperatures in discharge channels. Recent midlatitude and subtropical case studies 
involving cloud resolved modeling constrained by observed flash rates and anvil NOx 
measurements from field experiments such as STERAO [DeCaria et al., 2005], 
EULINOX [Fehr et al., 2004; Ott et al., 2007], and CRYSTAL-FACE [Ott et al., 
2010], have found that IC flashes dissipate nearly as much energy as CG flashes and 
that both CG and IC midlatitude flashes produce on average about 500 NO moles 
 
 
 
80 
flash−1 [e.g., Ott et al., 2010]. In our WRF-Chem simulations, we assume all flashes 
produce 500 moles of NO. Our parameterization only injects lightning NO over grid 
boxes in which parameterized deep convection is active. 
To specify flash frequency in each grid box, we use the look up table 
by Hansen [2012] who analyzed a relationship between convective precipitation and 
mixed phase depth (both from NARR reanalysis) and total lightning flash rate derived 
from NLDN observations. This new lightning parameterization technique is currently 
being implemented and is expected to be available to the community in the next 
annual WRF-Chem release.  Hansen [2012] constructed two look up tables from 
summer 2004 NLDN observed flash rates and NARR fields over the continental 
United States, one for 36 km resolution (employed in this study) and the other for 
12 km. The look up table contains NARR mixed phase depth (every 100m), 3 hour 
total precipitation (for every 1 mm), and the coinciding 3 hour flash rate. In WRF-
Chem, the mixed phase depth is determined by the difference between the height of 
the freezing level and −40°C isotherm. One of the advantages of using the look up 
table parameterization is that the total flash rate can be diagnosed in each time step 
(i.e., no preprocessing is required). In our case, mean model flash rates using the look 
up table were overestimated with respect to monthly NLDN estimate (CG flashes 
adjusted by IC/CG ratio to obtain the sum of IC and CG flashes) over the CONUS 
and therefore required scaling by a factor of 0.77, which is applied to every grid box. 
This is likely because the Grell 3-D convective parameterization overestimated 
precipitation compared to the NARR data set. 
 
 
 
81 
In addition to the approach of Allen et al. [2012], who used only convective 
precipitation to estimate flash frequency, the Hansen [2012] approach also uses 
mixed phase depth, which is indicative of lapse rate. A shallow depth corresponds to 
a larger lapse rate, implying stronger updrafts and therefore more lightning than when 
the mixed phase depth is greater (i.e., a smaller lapse rate). 
The mean NLDN (IC + CG) flash rate over the CONUS in July 2007 was 8.4 
flash s−1. Figure 24 shows that the geographical distributions of observed flash rates, 
model convective precipitation and model flash rates for both schemes are similar 
over the CONUS. The mean July 2007 observed flash rate peaked over Florida 
(Figure 24a), which corresponds to convective precipitation predicted by WRF for the 
same time period (Figure 24b). The distribution of model flash rate in Figure 24c 
derived from the look up table using convective precipitation and mixed phase depth 
[Hansen, 2012] is similar to the distribution of model flash rate in Figure 24d derived 
from just convective precipitation [Allen et al., 2012]. The scheme with look up table 
[Hansen, 2012] captured the peak over Florida better because of its nonlinear 
response to increases in convective precipitation. The difference between model and 
observed flash rate over southern Texas is due to biases in model precipitation. 
Next, we analyze model flash rate histograms. This analysis is needed because 
O3 production is a nonlinear function of NOx concentration with smaller flash rates 
producing O3 more efficiently. Figure 25 compares the histograms of model flash 
rates for both approaches with the NLDN based estimate. The histograms are 
constructed from all grid boxes with nonzero flash rate. Both Hansen [2012] and 
Allen et al. [2012] agree with the histogram of observed flash rates with a slight 
 
 
 
82 
underestimation of grid boxes with very small flash rates. There are 16% of grid 
boxes with flash rate < 0.5 flash–1 for NLDN-based total, whereas Hansen [2012] and 
Allen et al. [2012] show 13% and 11%, respectively. We expect that this small 
underestimation has a minor impact on O3 production. 
Besides the similarities seen in mean horizontal flash rate distributions and 
histograms, both approaches yield similar day-to-day variations (Figure 26). Using 
the look up table gives slightly higher correlation between model and NLDN-based 
flash rates compared to the approach of Allen et al. [2012] (correlation of 0.51 versus 
0.48). Model flash rates derived from the look up table by Hansen [2012] are highly 
correlated with model convective precipitation (r = 0.93), so there is little room to 
improve day-to-day variations if mixed phase depth is used in addition to convective 
precipitation. 
We use the summer 2006–2007 segment altitude distributions (SADs) based 
on VHF sources from the North Alabama lightning mapping array (LMA) to 
distribute lightning NO in the vertical [Koshak et al., 2010]. Total SADs (i.e., the sum 
of IC and CG flashes) are calculated by the Lightning Nitrogen Oxides Model 
(LNOM) [Koshak and Peterson, 2011], which uses the vertical distribution of flash 
channel segments that are constructed from the VHF source data. To obtain the NOx 
profile, we force the lower negative charge layer (lower relative peak of SAD 
associated with CG flashes), or the so-called “N-region” altitude of the thundercloud, 
to be at the height of the −15°C isotherm (Z−15). This is consistent with assumptions 
in the work of Koshak and Peterson [2011] and Ott et al. [2010]. 
 
 
 
83 
Hansen et al. [2010] analyzed thunderstorms from two summers over the 
Kennedy Space Center, Florida and found that the vertical distribution of lightning 
sources varies between storms and depends on the storm top height. In order to better 
account for these variations, we apply two different profiles, as shown in Figure 27a, 
one for low elevations (the eastern United States and adjacent waters) and the other 
for high elevations (the northern latitudes and mountains), with a threshold of 
Z−15 = 6.7 km (Figure 27b). The histogram in Figure 27c shows how Z−15 is 
distributed for all cases with deep convection during the modeling period with the 
threshold of 6.7 km clearly separating the two scenarios. The difference between the 
two is that for low elevations and latitudes, the lower peak of SAD (associated with 
CG flashes) is at ~7.3 km above ground level (AGL), while it is at ~5.5 km AGL for 
high elevations and latitudes. The higher peak of SAD (associated with IC flashes) is 
at ~11 km AGL for low elevations and latitudes and at ~9 km AGL for high 
elevations and latitudes. This addresses the fact that storm top heights are higher AGL 
over the southern United States, where elevations are lower and convection is deeper. 
Therefore, the LNOx is deposited 2 km higher compared to the rest of the domain.

and (d) based on convective precipitation [Allen et al., 2012]. Model flash rates 
in Figures 24c and 24d are scaled so the monthly sum over the CONUS 
matches the NLDN-based sum in Figure 24b. All flash rates are in units of flash 
s−1 per 36-km grid box. Detection efficiency for NLDN observed flashes falls 
off rapidly with distance from coast. Therefore NLDN flash rates do not 
represent actual flash rates for locations with distance > 300 km from the coast. 
Model flash rates outside of the CONUS are decreased by a factor 
f = exp(−d / 1000), where d is the distance from the coast in km.

4.2.4  Radiation Schemes in WRF 
For air quality applications, WRF-Chem is most commonly configured with 
the Rapid Radiative Transfer Model (RRTM) longwave and Goddard shortwave 
radiation schemes [Chapman et al., 2009]. For this configuration, the aerosol 
properties are fully coupled with WRF meteorology and chemistry when run with the 
MOZAIC aerosol model [Fast et al., 2006; Gustafson et al., 2007], which allows 
simulation of the localized cooling by sulfate aerosol and heating by black carbon. In 
the current version of WRF-Chem, O3 calculated by WRF-Chem photochemistry in 
the troposphere is not used in radiation schemes (neither longwave nor shortwave). 
All radiation schemes in WRF use climatological profiles of O3 throughout the 
atmospheric column. For instance, the RRTM longwave scheme assumes one 
climatological O3 profile (the average of standard midlatitude summer and winter) 
each time the radiative transfer is calculated. The Goddard shortwave and longwave 
schemes use five climatological O3 profiles (standard midlatitude and subarctic 
summer and winter profiles and tropical profile) to calculate the radiative heating 
rates. These standard ozone profiles come from the Air Force Geophysics Laboratory 
(AFGL) reference atmospheres [Anderson et al., 1986]. The tropical profile is used 
for latitudes 0°–30°; the midlatitude profiles are used for latitudes 30°–60°, and the 
subarctic profiles are used for latitudes 60°–90°. 
There are large differences in the UT/LS between these standard ozone 
profiles. For instance, the ozone concentration at 12 km is 80 ppbv, 220 ppbv and 
520 ppbv for the tropical, midlatitude summer and midlatitude winter profiles, 
respectively. Figure 28 compares these standard profiles with mean simulated ozone 
 
 
 
88 
profiles averaged over the eastern two thirds of United States (110°W–70°W, 25°N–
45°N) for July 2007. The model tropopause lies in between the standard tropical and 
midlatitude tropopause, and there is much less predicted O3 in the UT/LS region 
compared to the standard midlatitude summer climatology used in the RRTM 
longwave radiation scheme. 
In the next section, we explore the longwave radiative effects of these 
differences and ozone perturbations in the UT/LS. At this time the shortwave 
radiative effects will not be discussed further.

from the sensitivity simulation with no LNOx source averaged over the same 
area and time period is shown in black, and lightning enhancement is indicated 
by blue shaded area. Standard midlatitude summer (red), standard midlatitude 
winter (brown) and standard tropical (green) vertical profiles assumed in 
radiation schemes are shown as dashed lines. Please see text in section 4.2.4 for 
more details regarding these profiles.

4.3  Single Column Experiments With the Offline RRTM Longwave 
Model 
The rapid radiative transfer model (RRTM) is an accurate and 
computationally fast model [Mlawer et al., 1997] which uses the correlated-k method 
[Fu and Liou, 1992] to calculate fluxes and heating rates. The RRTM agrees well 
with calculations from the line-by-line radiative transfer model [Clough and Iacono, 
1995] which has been and continues to be extensively validated against high quality 
radiometric measurements [Clough et al., 2005; Shephard et al., 2009]. 
The RRTM calculates fluxes and heating rates using water vapor and 
temperature profiles and cloud information obtained online from WRF. Ozone mixing 
ratios are interpolated from the average midlatitude reference profile (i.e., average of 
midlatitude summer and winter) onto model levels. Therefore in the standard WRF-
Chem implementation, the ozone vertical distribution used in the RRTM does not 
vary in space or time. 
We explore the impact of O3 perturbations in the UT/LS region on radiative 
fluxes. We apply the stand-alone version of RRTM3.3 (available at 
http://rtweb.aer.com) to compute the OLR and heating rates for standard midlatitude 
summer and tropical atmospheric profiles in a single column for clear sky conditions. 
First, we compute the OLR difference between the standard midlatitude summer and 
tropical atmosphere. Outgoing longwave radiation for the standard midlatitude 
summer atmosphere is 281.4 W m−2 and for the standard tropical atmosphere is 287.2 
W m−2. The difference of 5.8 W m−2 is because of differences in the vertical 
 
 
 
91 
distribution of ozone, temperature and water vapor used in the radiative transfer 
calculation. Second, we compute the OLR difference between the mean O3 profile 
predicted by WRF-Chem (the July 2007 average over the eastern two thirds of the 
United States, see Figure 28) and the average midlatitude O3 profile (assumed 
climatology in RRTM), both with standard midlatitude summer temperature and 
water vapor profiles in order to separate the effects due to O3 perturbations. The 
difference between the two is 3.6 W m−2. Next, we explore the difference due to 
lightning enhancement as diagnosed from the WRF-Chem standard LNOx simulation 
and simulation noL (Table 4) (the July 2007 average over the eastern two thirds of the 
United States, see Figure 28). The OLR due to enhanced O3 from LNOx is reduced by 
0.36 W m−2. These flux values represent a back of envelope calculation of the impact 
of changes in O3 in the UT/LS region on OLR for a case with the standard midlatitude 
summer water vapor and temperature and clear sky conditions. 
The impact of different O3 distributions on heating rates is shown in Figure 
29a. This figure depicts vertical profiles of the heating rates from the standard 
midlatitude summer and tropical profiles. Because of less ozone in the upper 
troposphere in the standard tropical ozone profile, ozone heating rates are smaller 
than for the standard midlatitude ozone profile. The upper troposphere at ~200 hPa 
(12 km) is the most sensitive to ozone perturbations, with a small impact below 5 km 
(Figure 29b). Ozone increments added in the UT/LS region have the largest impact on 
heating rates and fluxes because the temperature contrast between the radiation 
absorbed and emitted by an O3 increment is the largest near the tropopause [Lacis et 
al., 1990].

(980–1080 cm−1), and (b) radiative heating rate sensitivity to changes in vertical 
ozone distribution for the standard midlatitude summer (green) and tropical 
(brown) ozone profiles from Figure 28. For vertical sensitivity in Figure 29b, 
40-ppbv ozone increments were added to each atmospheric layer (layer centers 
are indicated by plus signs in the right panel), and the peak increase in heating 
rate (from the 9.6 µm ozone band) is then normalized to 1 Dobson unit ozone 
increment.

4.4  WRF-Chem Results 
We start by analyzing the general features of the standard WRF-Chem 
simulation (Table 4). Figure 30 shows the NOx and O3 concentrations at the surface 
and upper troposphere averaged from hourly model output between 2 July and 30 
July. NOx concentrations are the largest at the surface because of large anthropogenic 
NOx emissions, including areas such as the Ohio River Valley, Chicago, and Detroit 
(Figure 30c). In the upper troposphere, the largest concentrations are over Florida 
where lightning occurs most frequently (Figure 30a). The mean O3 concentrations at 
the surface over the eastern two thirds of the United States is 41 ppbv with a standard 
deviation (σ) of 11 ppbv. The upper tropospheric values are a factor of 2 larger, but 
the variability for O3 remains unchanged over the same region (σ = 11 ppbv, 68% of 
the O3 distribution at 300 hPa is between 69 ppbv and 91 ppbv). The upper 
troposphere over the eastern United States has larger O3 concentrations than over the 
western half, with a local maximum over Virginia and North Carolina. Figure 28 
shows that the mean O3 enhancement produced from LNOx over this area, as 
diagnosed from the sensitivity simulation noL (Table 4) at 300 hPa, is 22 ppbv, which 
indicates that lightning contributes more than one quarter to the UT O3 
concentrations.

standard simulation LNOx (Table 4) averaged from 2 July to 30 July, 2007 at

deviation (σ) of hourly time series over the eastern two thirds of the United 
States are indicated in the title of each plot. 
 
4.4.1  Comparison With Surface NOx and NOy Measurements at Pinnacle State 
Park Research Site 
In this section, we evaluate the WRF-Chem simulation using hourly NOy and 
NOx measurements at a remote site in Pinnacle State Park, New York, located at 
 
 
 
95 
42.1°N and 77.2°N with elevation of 504 m [Schwab et al., 2009]. The WRF-Chem 
captures the diurnal and day-to-day variations in both NOy and NOx (Figure 31). 
Mean observed NOy during July 2007 was 2.72 ppbv. Simulated NOy is 
overestimated with respect to observations by 0.25 ppbv (9%), mainly because of 
nighttime overprediction (by 0.51 ppbv, 19%). Daytime NOy overestimation is 0.12 
ppbv (4%). Mean observed NOx was 1.46 ppbv. Mean NOx bias during day and night 
is small (–0.02 ppbv). 
In general, both simulated NOy and NOx agree well with measured data at this 
rural location in the northeastern United States.

New York, research site (blue line) and simulated with the WRF-Chem (red 
line) for July 2007. Measurements of NOx between 19 and 24 July are missing. 
Missing data between 9 and 10 July are due to failure of air conditioning in the 
instrument unit.

4.4.2  Comparison With OMI NO2 Columns 
The Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) aboard the NASA Aura satellite 
measures direct sunlight and backscattered light from the Earth’s atmosphere in the 
ultraviolet-visible range. It retrieves NO2 with a resolution of 13 × 24 km2 in nadir. 
We use the level 2 Dutch OMI NO2 product (DOMINO) version 2 [Boersma et al., 
2007, 2011]. Similarly, as with SCIAMACHY data (section 3.3.2.3), pixels with 
cloud fractions exceeding 0.3 are excluded from analysis. 
In order to compare satellite retrieved NO2 columns to their WRF-Chem 
counterparts, we sample hourly WRF-Chem NO2 profiles at the locations and times 
of OMI retrievals. Next, we interpolate these WRF-Chem profiles onto the TM4 
vertical grid and then we apply the OMI averaging kernels for each OMI pixel. To 
obtain the tropospheric NO2 columns, we integrate tropospheric layers up to the TM4 
tropopause. Finally, we aggregate both OMI and WRF-Chem columns onto a 0.5° × 
0.5° grid. The mean value in each grid box is obtained by weighting the high quality 
retrievals using the algorithm of Celarier and Retscher [2009] by applying weights to 
both OMI and WRF-Chem columns. This algorithm gives more weighting to near-
nadir pixels than to far-off-nadir pixels and to clear sky pixels than to partly cloudy 
pixels. This method of comparing OMI retrievals and model output is the same as in 
the work of Allen et al. [2012], who compared OMI with the CMAQ air quality 
model. 
Figure 32 compares the tropospheric NO2 columns from DOMINO with 
WRF-Chem simulated columns. The mean columns on the native 36 km grid are 
shown in Figure 32b. They were calculated using hourly model output at the time

closest to overpass time assuming the tropopause is at 150 hPa. Figure 32c shows the 
mean WRF-Chem columns after interpolation onto the TM4 vertical grid, applying 
averaging kernel and aggregating onto a 0.5° × 0.5° grid. Figure 32d is the same 
except with the LNOx source decreased by a factor of 2. This is consistent with 
previous analyses done with the UMD-CTM model in which we conducted two 
simulations, one with high LNOx production and the other with the LNOx source 
decreased by a factor of 2. The flashes over the southeastern United States may be 
more tropical in nature and therefore producing less NO moles than their midlatitude 
counterparts. Tropical thunderstorms have smaller vertical wind shear resulting in 
shorter flash lengths which may cause smaller NO production per flash [Huntrieser et 
al., 2009]. 
Allen et al. [2012] showed that applying an averaging kernel improves the 
agreement with the satellite-retrieved DOMINO product. They analyzed CMAQ runs 
at 12 km and made a comparison on a 0.25° × 0.25° grid for summer 2006 and found 
that their columns were underestimated. However, the application of an averaging 
kernel brings the model columns closer to satellite-retrieved columns. In our case, the 
application of the averaging kernel reduces columns over the urban areas (e.g., 
Chicago, Detroit, Atlanta, New York) too much, but the domain average remains 
unchanged. WRF-Chem columns over the eastern two thirds of the United States 
(110°W−70°W, 25°N−45°N) using the standard simulation are overestimated 
compared to the DOMINO data by ~16%. Model columns using the simulation with 
LNOx decreased by a factor of 2 agree better, which indicates the sensitivity to 
lightning NO2 amounts. The reasons for the high bias are likely due to 
 
 
 
98 
overestimations in any or all of the following: (1) NO production flash−1, (2) NLDN-
based total flash rate (Figure 8 shows a factor of 2 larger estimate compared to 
OTD/LIS), and (3) ANOx emissions. The maxima due to lightning over Florida that 
are detected by the NLDN network are not present in the DOMINO product (Figure 
24a), which may partially be due to the coarse resolution of the TM4 chemical 
transport model (3° × 2°). These results indicate the challenges of comparing model 
columns with satellite-retrieved columns. The discrepancies may also arise from the 
differences in the vertical distribution of NO2 in WRF-Chem and the a priori profiles 
used in the NO2 retrieval.

4.4.3  Comparison With Ozonesonde Soundings 
In this section, we evaluate the WRF-Chem simulation using twenty 
ozonesonde measurements made during July 2007 over three North American sites: 
Beltsville, Maryland located at 76°W and 39°N, Huntsville, Alabama located at 87°W 
 
 
 
100 
and 35°N and Wallops Island, Virginia located at 75°W and 38°. At Beltsville, as part 
of the NASA WAVES campaign (Water Vapor Validation Experiments) hosted at the 
Howard University Research Campus, two soundings were launched during the night 
at 06 UTC, and nine were launched in the early afternoon at 18 UTC to capture 
overpasses of the Aqua and Aura satellites. At Huntsville, soundings were launched 
weekly on Saturdays at 18 UTC. We use the data averaged over 100 meter intervals 
downloaded from http://nsstc.uah.edu/atmchem/about_ozonesonde.html. At Wallops 
Island, soundings were also launched at 18 UTC, and the data are provided by 
NASA-WFF (Wallops Island Flight Facility) from World Ozone and Ultraviolet 
Radiation Data Centre (WOUDC) from http://www.woudc.org. 
Figure 33 compares mean modeled and observed ozone profiles at these three 
North American sites during July 2007. Lightning NO production (500 mol flash−1) 
increases model-calculated upper tropospheric (500–200 hPa) ozone by 21–23 ppbv 
over the Beltsville, Huntsville and Wallops Island sites. As expected, WRF-Chem 
simulated profiles with lightning NO emissions match the shape of the ozonesonde 
profiles better in the middle and upper troposphere and capture the concentrations in 
the UT/LS region better than the simulation without LNOx emissions. 
Next, we compare the biases of WRF-Chem LNOx simulations with the 
UMD-CTM simulation (L2) in section 3.3.2.2 (Figure 11). Compared to UMD-CTM, 
WRF-Chem shows (1) better agreement throughout the vertical column at Huntsville, 
a site with frequent thunderstorms, (2) better agreement at the surface for all three 
sites, and (3) similar overestimation by as much as 14 ppbv at Wallops 
Island.  Allen et al. [2012] noted overestimation of 23 ppbv in the upper troposphere 
 
 
 
101 
using the CMAQ air quality model during summer 2006 at Huntsville and Wallops 
Island. 
4.4.3.1 Uncertainty Analysis 
The uncertainty of the simulated vertical distribution of O3 depends on the 
uncertainty of ozone precursor emissions and on the uncertainty of ozone and 
precursor transport and chemistry. The most important precursor of ozone is NOx. 
Because the lifetime of NOx is much shorter than the lifetime of ozone, both 
emissions (ANOx and LNOx) and vertical transport (boundary layer venting, warm 
conveyor belts and deep convection) impact the vertical distribution of O3 and its 
precursors [e.g., Pickering et al., 1992; Cooper et al., 2006]. The largest source of 
ANOx emissions uncertainty is representation of mobile sources (about one third of 
total ANOx emissions); uncertainty can be 30% or more. In addition to this 
uncertainty, our ANOx emissions may be biased high by 5%−15% in the eastern 
United States, since we use 2005 NEI emissions. Figure 34 shows an estimate of the 
decrease in ANOx emissions from the United States between summer 2005 and 2007 
as derived from OMI observations of NO2 columns and using the GEOS-Chem model 
[Lamsal et al., 2011]. The comparison with measurements at a rural location in 
Pinnacle State Park, New York (section 4.4.1), suggests that errors in boundary layer 
concentrations are not a large contributor to biases in the free troposphere. 
To estimate the uncertainty of boundary layer venting and deep convection, 
we conducted a sensitivity simulation with the new Kain Fritsch (KFEta) convective 
parameterization [Kain, 2004]. Compared to the standard simulation with Grell 3-D 
 
 
 
102 
convective parameterization, the impact on upper tropospheric (500–200 hPa) ozone 
at three ozonesonde sites was less than ±1.3 ppbv (<2%). Of course, differences 
between model simulations are usually smaller than differences between models and 
observations. 
Emissions of NOx directly into the UT are primarily due to lightning and 
aircraft traffic. Lightning NO emissions are a function of flash rate, vertical 
partitioning of NO and NO production per flash. The main contributor to uncertainty 
due to LNOx emissions is the NO production per flash. For example, when the LNOx 
source is changed from 240 to 480 NO mol flash−1, the UT ozone increases by 5 ppbv 
(6%) [Allen et al., 2010]. Production per flash for individual storms may be outside of 
this range adding additional uncertainty. In addition, our flash rates may be 
overestimated (Figure 34 shows a factor of 2 discrepancy between NLDN-based and 
LIS-based total flash rates south of 35°N during 2002–2005). Including aircraft 
emissions increases O3 concentrations by 0.7 ppbv (1%) [Allen et al., 2012]. 
Imprecisions in photolysis and chemical reaction rates also contribute to 
overall uncertainty. For example, uncertainty in the photolysis rate of NO2 (an 
important reaction for ozone production) used in the photochemical mechanism is 
20% [JPL, 2006]. Noteworthy is the study by Thompson and Stewart [1991] who 
using a Monte Carlo technique, showed that the combined effects of rate constant 
uncertainties in a photochemical model are 16% for O3. Another unaccounted source 
of uncertainty may be the rate at which NO2 oxidizes to HNO3. Allen et al. [2012], in 
a chemistry sensitivity simulation based on the recommendations of Henderson et al. 
[2011], showed an impact of 2 ppbv (3%) on O3 concentrations due to known 
 
 
 
103 
uncertainties in the NO2 conversion rate to HNO3. In addition, the lifetime of alkyl 
nitrates is overestimated in the model [Saylor and Stein, 2012]. While this likely leads 
to an overestimation of concentrations of alkyl nitrates in the boundary layer, we 
expect that in the upper troposphere, the contribution to ozone biases is relatively 
small compared to the effect in the boundary layer. Further research is needed to 
improve the understanding of NOx lifetime (including the understanding of alkyl and 
isoprene nitrate chemistry) and its impacts on ozone concentrations. 
In order to estimate uncertainty due to possible HO2 biases [Wennberg et al., 
1998], we sample simulated HO2 concentrations at hours and locations of DC-8 
measurements during the INTEX-A campaign. We use only the measurements from 
nine flights that were over the CONUS. Model HO2 is approximately the same or 
slightly less than the observed HO2 in the upper troposphere (model shows <5% low 
bias for four flights and <20% low bias for five flights), so it does not appear that 
HO2 biases contribute to O3 biases. However, definitive results are not possible 
because this comparison is between July 2004 and July 2007. 
In addition to the uncertainties of NOx, transport errors also contribute to 
ozone errors (the ozone loss in the UT/LS is small). Although stratosphere to 
troposphere exchange contributes to UT concentrations, it is most important in the 
springtime. For summertime conditions, the dominant transport-related factor is the 
specification of lateral boundary conditions [Tang et al., 2008]. 
Despite these uncertainties mentioned above, simulated O3 profiles compare 
well with vertical soundings and well capture UT/LS concentrations (ozone 
 
 
 
104 
tropopause), which is important for investigating the radiative efffects of interactive 
ozone and ozone produced from lightning.

4.4.4  Ozone Enhancements From Lightning and Impact on Surface Ozone 
We analyze O3 enhancements generated from global lightning NO sources for 
July 2007, focusing on the upper troposphere of the continental United States. 
Although not strictly true, because of the nonlinear response of O3 to NOx emissions, 
the lightning enhancement is diagnosed as the difference between simulations with 
and without the LNOx source. We complement results from WRF-Chem simulations 
by including the results from GMI-CTM, which provides two sets of boundary 
conditions for trace gases, one with global source of LNOx and one without. It should 
be noted that here we shut off global source, whereas in chapter 3 using the UMD-
CTM, LNOx sources are turned off only from the North American continent. 
 
 
 
106 
Figure 35 shows mean ozone enhancements due to LNOx in the upper 
troposphere (at 300 hPa) as diagnosed by the global GMI-CTM and regional WRF-
Chem models (both with 500 NO mol flash−1). Although most thunderstorms were 
over the southeastern United States and very few over the northwest, a significant 
portion of ozone generated from LNOx in the upper troposphere enters the WRF-
Chem domain from GMI-CTM through western boundary. Similarly, the results from 
the global UMD-CTM (Figure 15) simulations showed that O3 enhancements from 
lightning NO emissions from North America influence O3 concentrations 
considerably throughout the tropospheric column in remote locations downwind 
(North Atlantic, North Africa, southern Europe). Over the continental United States 
both GMI-CTM and WRF-Chem have consistent O3 concentrations with maximum 
(30 ppbv) over Florida. 
During July 2007, lightning NO2 represented 25% of the simulated 
tropospheric NO2 column over the eastern United States (Figure 32). The mean 
contribution of LNOx to surface layer ozone over the same area was 4.7 ppbv (Figure 
36). The mean increase in 8 h O3 due to LNOx reaches high values in some locations 
in the western United States because of sunny conditions and deep boundary layer in 
these regions (Colorado, Nevada show 8–9 ppbv enhancements in 8 h O3). 
A number of studies have analyzed the impact of lightning NO at the surface. 
Kaynak et al. [2008] and  Allen et al. [2012] analyzed the summers of 2004 and 2006 
and found that lightning NO increased 8 h O3 over the CONUS by less than 2–
2.5 ppbv on 70% of days. In this study, we find that the 70% percentile reaches the 
 
 
 
107 
value of 5.6 ppbv over the CONUS. The median over the CONUS is 4.2 ppbv for all 
days and 3.8 ppbv for poor air quality days (with 8 h O3 > 60 ppbv). 
It is unclear why our results show larger 8 h O3 values compared to other 
investigators. This may be because of the differences between the representation of 
boundary layer mixing in CMAQ (other investigators) and WRF-Chem (this study).

4.4.5  Impact on OLR and Radiative Effects 
In this section, we first compare model OLR with NOAA-18 satellite 
observations. We investigate the impact of using model O3 in the radiation scheme 
(i.e., the impact of interactive O3) on OLR. These results are then compared to OLR 
reduction due to O3 generated from LNOx (i.e., the radiative forcing of lightning 
enhanced O3). 
Estimates of outgoing longwave radiation from National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) polar-orbiting satellites are often used to locate 
deep convection and estimate the earth’s radiation budget. The NOAA-18 satellite 
crosses the equator at 0155 and 1355 LST. We use the daily OLR data available at 
http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.interp_OLR.html. This data set is the 
 
 
 
109 
daily average computed from the twice-daily fields gridded at 2.5° × 2.5° resolution. 
For details on how the OLR data set is constructed (i.e., data screening and filling 
gaps with interpolations in time and space) see Note by Liebmann and Smith [1996]. 
Figure 37 compares OLR data from the NOAA-18 satellite with model output 
sampled at satellite overpass times. The mean predicted OLR from the standard 
WRF-Chem simulation agrees with NOAA-18 measurements with relatively small 
biases (Figure 37c). For the standard LNOx simulation over the eastern two thirds of 
the United States, the mean OLR difference with respect to satellite observations in 
regions with a low bias is −5.4%, and the mean difference in regions with a high bias 
is +2.6%. The overall bias is −2.8% or −7.1 W m−2. We compare our results to 
Choi et al. [2009], who analyzed summer 2005 using the regional chemical transport 
model REAM. In contrast to our results, Choi et al. overestimated OLR with respect 
to satellite observations over most of the CONUS with mean high biases of 4.7%–
5.7%. 
If model O3 is incorporated in the radiation scheme (interactive O3 
simulation), we see that low bias over the most of the CONUS (65% of grid boxes) 
decreases and high bias seen over the north central United States increases (Figure 
37d). This is because of less model O3 in the UT than the assumed O3 climatology 
(see Figure 28). The root mean square error decreases from 14.6 W m−2 to 13.3 
W m−2 over the CONUS; however, there is no significant improvement regionally 
(i.e., the root mean square error of values adjusted for the mean bias between mean 
observed and simulated OLR is the same for both simulations with and without 
 
 
 
110 
interactive ozone). Mean OLR increase due to interactive ozone is 3.1 W m−2 (Figure 
38). The impact of LNOx on OLR biases is smaller and not shown. 
We complement the OLR results by analyzing the cloud top pressure data 
from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) also onboard the 
Aqua satellite. We are interested in all types of high clouds (cirrus, cirrostratus and 
deep convective clouds) as they are most effective in altering the top-of-atmosphere 
longwave radiative fluxes [Chen et al., 2000]. We use the level 2 cloud data 
collection 5 with a spatial footprint of ~5 km [Menzel et al., 2008]. We composite the 
observed and simulated columns onto a 0.3905° longitude × 0.3237° latitude grid, 
which corresponds to 36 × 36 km2 at latitude 34°N. The ISCCP (International 
Satellite Cloud Climatology Project) classifies high clouds as those whose cloud top 
pressure is less than 440 hPa. The WRF simulation indicates that there were, on 
average, 17.4 days out of 29 with high cloud occurrence, whereas MODIS 
observations indicate 16.3 high cloud days (Figure 39). The spatial distribution of 
high cloud frequency corresponds closely to the spatial distribution of OLR (Figure 
37). 
We extend our analysis by comparing the OLR changes due to interactive O3 
for all sky and clear sky conditions (Figure 40). For clear sky conditions, the impact 
on OLR is larger (4.2 W m−2 for clear versus 3.1 W m−2 for all sky conditions). The 
value of 4.2 W m−2 is close to the single column calculation (3.6 W m−2) done for 
standard midlatitude summer and clear sky conditions in section 4.3. 
The magnitude of this impact is nearly as large as the expected value of 
radiative forcing from a doubling of CO2 (i.e., +3.7 W m−2 with clouds, stratospheric 
 
 
 
111 
adjustment and solar absorption included) [IPCC, 2007]. This suggests that inclusion 
of interactive ozone in the model radiation could be important for the regional climate 
simulations (with long simulation times). Climate simulations indicate the 3.7 W m−2 
forcing can result in a 3–5 K increase in global surface temperature. 
Next, we investigate the impact of O3 perturbations due to LNOx on radiative 
forcing. The mean lightning enhancement in the upper troposphere (500–200 hPa) is 
22 ppbv as diagnosed from the simulation with 500 NO mol flash−1 (Figure 28). The 
single column calculations (section 4.3) suggested that the OLR reduction due to this 
22-ppbv enhancement is 0.36 W m−2. Figure 41 shows the mean geographic 
distribution of radiative forcing due to ozone generated from LNOx. Mean OLR 
reduction due to lightning over the eastern two thirds of the United States is 
0.25 W m−2 for all sky and 0.37 W m−2 for clear sky conditions. The clear sky value is 
close to the value of 0.36 W m−2 determined from the single column calculations 
(section 4.3). The radiative forcing due to lightning for clear sky conditions found 
here is in the middle of the range of 0.20–0.50 W m−2 for summer 2004 reported 
by Martini et al. [2011], who used UMD-CTM offline calculations (see Figure 19). In 
contrast to offline calculations, we see larger spatial variability and also some values 
of opposite sign due to changes in vertical distributions of temperature and water 
vapor, which are a result of the ozone-radiative feedback. 
Figure 42a shows that the interactive ozone has a small cooling effect of 
−0.15°C on monthly mean UT temperatures. This cooling is because of less simulated 
UT ozone than in the standard climatological ozone profile. Figure 42b shows that 
ozone generated from LNOx has an even smaller positive effect on monthly mean UT 
 
 
 
112 
temperature (0.01°C) with a mean standard deviation of 0.14°C (i.e., 68% of the 
distribution is within −0.13°C and +0.15°C). 
To summarize, the single column calculations for clear sky conditions with 
assumed standard midlatitude summer temperature and water vapor profiles showed 
that the impact of interactive O3 was a factor of 10 larger than the impact of LNOx on 
OLR. Applying the fully interactive WRF-Chem model for the entire month of July, 
including the whole range of meteorological conditions, the impact of interactive O3 
on OLR is a factor of 12 larger than that of LNOx. We have shown that the inclusion 
of interactive ozone in radiative transfer improves the predicted OLR. The impact of 
interactive ozone on meteorology (upper tropospheric temperature) is small when 
averaged over a month’s series of 4-day simulations.

4.4.6  Impact on Daily Fields 
The analysis in previous section is focused on the mean impact of interactive 
ozone because the metric in the IPCC for radiative forcing is the mean over time and 
space. In this section, we present individual snapshots from four selected simulations 
to highlight the variations in instantaneous radiative forcing due to interactive ozone 
on a day-to-day basis. 
First, we analyze the impact of interactive ozone on OLR. For brevity, we 
refer to the simulation with interactive ozone as IO and to the standard simulation 
 
 
 
117 
with noninteractive as NIO. Figures 43 and 44 show the OLR impact at the 42-hour 
and 90-hour simulation times for four selected simulations. As the simulation time 
increases, the differences between IO and NIO grow. The radiative impacts and 
feedbacks are the largest at the end of the simulations (i.e., after 90 hours of run time, 
which is a typical length of simulations by operational mesoscale models). Although 
one third of grid boxes are clear sky, showing increased OLR (by about 4 W m−2), the 
changes in OLR are dominated by the changes in cloud distributions (horizontal and 
vertical). We see great spatial variability with most of the values within the range of 4 
W m−2 ± 39 W m−2. Large negative values can be explained by (1) cloudy skies in IO 
that are clear skies in NIO and (2) higher cloud tops in IO compared to NIO. Large 
positive values can be explained by (1) clear skies in IO that are cloudy skies in NIO 
and (2) lower cloud tops in IO compared to NIO. Table 5 summarizes the changes in 
horizontal (cloud cover) and vertical cloud distributions (cloud tops) and resulting 
OLR changes at the 90-hour simulation times. 
The results in Figure 44 and Table 5 indicate that the simulated cloud 
distributions are sensitive to decreased heating in the upper troposphere due to less O3 
in IO compared to NIO. In general, we see a large spatial variability in OLR because 
of horizontal cloud displacements and differences in cloud cover and cloud tops 
between IO and NIO simulations. This suggests that changes seen in Figure 40 
showing the impact of interactive ozone on OLR are coupled with changed cloud 
distributions (vertical and spatial). The same is true for Figure 41 showing the impact 
of O3 produced from LNOx on OLR. At the same time, the changes in cloud 
distributions are a result of ozone perturbations in the radiation schemes. In order to 
 
 
 
118 
calculate the radiative forcing due only to O3 enhancement, the cloud distributions 
and other meteorological parameters (i.e., temperature, water vapor profiles and skin 
temperature) would have to be held constant. 
Next, we analyze the impact of interactive ozone on upper tropospheric 
temperatures. Similar to OLR, the impact is the largest at the end of the simulations. 
We see that decreased heating due to less O3 in the UT results in a small cooling 
effect with most of the temperatures at the 90-hour simulation times within the range 
of –0.21°C ± 0.31°C (Figure 45). Figure 46 shows the impact of interactive ozone 
incorporated only in the longwave radiation scheme. The overall cooling and spatial 
variability is decreased with most of the values within the range of −0.14°C ± 0.21°C 
when compared to combined longwave and shortwave effects of interactive ozone in 
Figure 45. Shifting our focus to the impact of ozone enhancements due to LNOx, we 
see that ozone enhancements from LNOx result in a small warming of 0.02°C with 
standard deviation of 0.18°C (Figure 47). As in the case of OLR, the changes in 
temperature are coupled with altered cloud distributions. Therefore, we see both 
cooling and warming effect. 
The temperature changes drive changes in geopotential heights. The impact of 
interactive ozone on 200 hPa geopotential heights is small with values mostly <12 m, 
which is 0.1% of typical 200 hPa geopotential height. However, horizontal gradients 
of the geopotential heights, important for geostrophic winds, increase by about 25 m 
(e.g., from Ohio to New York on July 22) resulting in a 3 m s−1 change in geostrophic 
wind. 
 
 
 
119 
To summarize, the instantaneous changes of OLR due to interactive ozone are 
dominated by altered cloud distributions (vertical and horizontal) with large spatial 
variability and grow as the simulation time increases with the largest effect at the end 
of the simulation times. Because of less O3 in interactive simulations, the 
temperatures in the upper troposphere show a cooling of −0.21°C at the end of the 
simulation times. The impact of ozone enhancements due to LNOx on upper 
troposphere temperature is a factor of 10 smaller warming.

4.4.7  Export of Reactive Nitrogen From the Contiguous United States 
The sum of oxidized nitrogen compounds, referred to as NOy, represent not 
just the key precursor to O3 but also an important source of nutrients for many 
ecosystems. Increased anthropogenic emissions have caused excessive deposition of 
nitrogen to ecosystems leading to eutrophication. The role of deposition from the 
atmosphere remains uncertain [Reactive Nitrogen in the United States: An Analysis 
of Inputs, Flows, Consequences and Management Options, A Report of the EPA 
Science Advisory Board (EPA-SAB-11-013)]. 
Global chemistry transport models have estimated that 65%–75% of the NOy 
emitted over the United States is deposited, and 25%–35% is exported [e.g., Horowitz 
 
 
 
123 
et al., 1998; Park et al., 2004b]. In this section, we estimate the export fluxes of NOy 
across the western and eastern boundaries of the United States. We define the 
CONUS boundary layer as the region extending horizontally from 30°N to 50°N with 
the eastern and western boundaries located about 250 km from the coast. We estimate 
NOy as the sum of the following oxidation products: NOx, NO3, 2 × N2O5, HONO, 
HNO3, HNO4, PAN, and lumped organic nitrates (NTR, called ONIT in Zaveri and 
Peters, [1999]). 
Figure 48 shows a vertical cross section of NOy export fluxes at the east coast 
of the United States averaged from 6 hour fields over July 2007. The fluxes shown 
are normalized by the area of the grid box. First, we analyze the fluxes from the 
simulation with no LNOx source (Figure 48a). The exports reach a maximum between 
40°N and 43°N, downwind of the highly populated region between Washington, D.C. 
and Boston, Massachusetts. Although a large amount of NOy is exported below 2.5 
km (0.11 Gmol d−1), most of it (0.24 Gmol d−1) is vented out of the boundary layer 
and exported through the east boundary in the free troposphere (see Table 6). 
If we assume that NOy entering at the west coast is transported directly across 
the region and exported eastward through the east wall (with no deposition) as is 
often assumed in the literature [e.g., Park et al., 2004b], the net export flux of NOy, 
considering the entire depth of troposphere, is 0.29 Gmol d–1 (the flux of 0.35 Gmol 
d−1 across the eastern boundary decreased by the flux of 0.06 Gmol d–1 across the 
western boundary). Our emission into the CONUS boundary layer is 1.25 Gmol d–1. 
This indicates that 23% of the emission from the boundary layer is exported. If we 
assume that all NOy entering at the west coast is deposited within the United States, 
 
 
 
124 
the NOy export is 28% of the boundary layer emission. This range of 23%–28% is 
likely overestimated due to the fact that the lifetime of NTR in the model is 
overestimated resulting in higher amounts of NOy [Saylor and Stein, 2012]. 
Decreasing the lifetime of NTR would lead to a small increase of HNO3 deposition, 
resulting in lower NOy exports through the eastern boundary. In the current 
simulation, the export of NTR contributes about 14% to NOy export (0.05 Gmol d−1 
from 0.35 Gmol d−1). 
Lightning NOx greatly enhances NOy exports through the eastern boundary 
(Figure 48b) because most of the LNOx is injected in the upper troposphere (above 8 
km) where wet deposition rates are smaller than in the boundary layer. NOy exports 
are increased by about 42% to 0.60 Gmol d−1 when the LNOx source (0.35 Gmol d–1) 
is included. For a simulation with low LNOx source, NOy exports increased by about 
24% to 0.46 Gmol d−1 due to lightning. Fang et al. [2010], using a different model 
but similar emissions, reported an increase of 24%–43% of the total United States 
NOy export due to lightning. A similar increase due to lightning was seen in the 
UMD-CTM (section 3.3.4). We estimate that 38% (0.35 Gmol d−1 from 1.6 Gmol d−1) 
of the total CONUS emissions including LNOx are exported. For the simulation with 
low LNOx source, this percentage is reduced to 26% (net export of 0.37 Gmol d–1 
divided by emission of 1.42 Gmol d−1). 
To summarize, the NOy export of 23%−28% of the boundary layer emission 
and 26%–38% of the total NOx emission over the CONUS is similar to literature 
estimates of 25%–35% obtained from using different CTMs in the EPA Report [EPA-
SAB-11-013].

4.5  Summary and Conclusions 
This study investigates the radiative effects of ozone perturbations in the 
upper troposphere. We have conducted several sensitivity simulations of July 2007 
with the regional scale, fully coupled WRF-Chem driven by meteorological fields 
from NASA’s MERRA reanalysis. The initial and boundary conditions for trace gases 
are interpolated from NASA’s global chemical transport model GMI, which includes 
combined tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry. 
The WRF-Chem model, most commonly configured with the RRTM radiation 
scheme, assumes one climatological profile of ozone for all latitudes in the longwave 
radiation scheme, which is the average of standard midlatitude summer and winter 
ozone profiles. The mean model tropopause is located at higher altitudes than the 
assumed climatology, so there is much less model ozone between 350 and 200 hPa 
than in the assumed climatology. Comparisons with ozonesonde measurements 
confirm that WRF-Chem well captures the ozone concentrations near the tropopause. 
In July 2007, the NLDN detected the largest flash rates over the southeastern 
United States with a clear peak over Florida. This lightning signal over Florida 
detected by the NLDN network is not as clearly seen in the satellite-retrieved NO2 
columns (DOMINO v2 product). When comparing the model flash rates, this peak 
was better captured by the new lightning parameterization, which uses mixed phase 
depth as a flash rate predictor in addition to the standard approach of using convective 
precipitation. However, the impact of using mixed phase depth on day-to-day 
variations between model and observed flash rate is small overall, and therefore, there 
 
 
 
127 
does not appear to be a benefit to using mixed phase depth as an additional predictor 
for interactive ozone simulations. 
We explore the radiative effects of model ozone by incorporating it into the 
longwave radiation scheme, thus allowing heating rates from ozone to affect the 
simulated meteorological and chemical quantities. The mean predicted outgoing 
longwave radiation (OLR) agrees well with satellite observations. When the 
climatological ozone profile is used in the longwave radiation scheme, the predicted 
OLR is 7.1 W m−2 lower than the mean satellite-observed OLR (247 W m−2) over the 
eastern two thirds of the United States. The predicted OLR is 3.1 W m−2 closer to 
satellite observations when the model ozone is incorporated into the longwave 
radiation scheme due to high bias in climatological ozone profile. The fully coupled 
interactive ozone framework of the WRF model allows to quantify the OLR changes 
due to ozone perturbations. The standard simulation with production of 500 NO mol 
flash−1 resulted in a 22 ppbv ozone enhancement in the upper troposphere. Due to this 
lightning enhancement, the OLR amounts are reduced by 0.25 W m−2 for all sky and 
0.37 W m−2 for clear sky conditions. The interactive ozone framework allows ozone 
heating rates to affect the simulated meteorological and chemical quantities. The 
impact of the interactive O3 on upper tropospheric temperatures is small (0.15°C 
averaged over ten 4-day simulations). The monthly mean impact of ozone from LNOx 
on temperature is even smaller. 
Our WRF-Chem results have been used to estimate the export fluxes of 
reactive nitrogen at the eastern coast of the United States. We estimate the export of 
 
 
 
128 
reactive nitrogen to be 23%−28% of the boundary layer emissions and 26%−38% of 
the total emissions including LNOx.

5  Summary and Future Work 
5.1  Summary of Global Modeling With the UMD-CTM 
We have conducted several simulations of summers 2002 and 2004 with the 
global chemistry transport model UMD-CTM driven by meteorological fields from 
the GEOS-4 CERES reanalysis. 
Week-to-week variations of lightning flash rates had a much larger impact on 
ozone tropospheric columns over North America and downwind relative to the large 
emission reductions that took place between 2002 and 2004 (the NOx SIP Call). Over 
the North Atlantic, changes in the ozone column between early summer 2002 and 
2004 due to changes in lightning and meteorology exceeded the change due to 
emission reductions by a factor of 7. Late summer changes in lightning were smaller 
and had a much smaller impact on ozone columns. Unlike North American 
anthropogenic emissions, which continue to show a downward trend over recent 
years, there is no clear trend in lightning flash rate. Therefore this factor of 7 cannot 
be generalized to other time periods and is derived primarily to demonstrate that the 
effect of week-to-week lightning variability can be large compared to emission 
reductions. In the second half of the summer, we see a large impact from lightning 
after the onset of the North American Monsoon reinforced by the upper level 
anticyclone centered over Mexico. 
In summer 2004, instantaneous radiative forcing (RF) due to ozone produced 
from anthropogenic emissions ranged from 0.15 to 0.30 W m−2 across the North 
Atlantic, while that due to ozone produced from lightning NO emissions ranged from 
 
 
 
130 
0.20 to 0.50 W m−2. A 50% increase in flash rate between early summer 2002 and 
2004  over the United States corresponds to a 30% increase in RF due to LNOx. The 
mean normalized RF per unit of added O3 column, over the areas with enhancements 
exceeding 5 DU, was 0.027 W m−2 DU−1 due to North American anthropogenic 
enhancements and 0.047 W m−2 DU−1 due to lightning enhancements. This is because 
of the larger radiative efficiency of upper tropospheric ozone perturbations. 
5.2  Summary of Regional Modeling With the WRF-Chem 
We have conducted several month long simulations (each comprised of ten 4-
day simulations) of July 2007 with the regional model WRF-Chem driven by 
meteorological fields from the MERRA reanalysis. 
We have tested a new lightning parameterization developed by Hansen 
[2012]. This scheme uses mixed phase depth as a flash rate predictor in addition to 
the standard approach of using convective precipitation, but for our specific time 
period it does not significantly improve the model flash rate compared to the standard 
approach. 
Interactive ozone in radiation schemes allows quantifying the changes in 
outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) due to ozone perturbations. Interactive ozone in 
WRF-Chem brings the predicted outgoing longwave radiation closer to satellite 
observations. The mean OLR bias of 7.1 W m−2 over the eastern two thirds of the 
United States is reduced by 3.1 W m−2. The mean OLR reduction due to ozone 
produced from LNOx (22 ppbv) over the same region is 0.25 W m−2 for all sky and 
0.37 W m−2 for clear sky conditions. 
 
 
 
131 
The impact of using interactive ozone versus climatological ozone on upper 
tropospheric temperatures is 0.15°C (determined as an average of ten 4-day 
simulations). The impact of ozone due to LNOx is small on a monthly mean basis. 
5.3  Future Work 
The research discussed in this dissertation has left several unanswered 
questions, which are worth examining in the future. These include the following: 
5.3.1  Offline Calculations of Radiative Forcing 
In the first part of the dissertation, we showed that ozone enhancements 
produced from LNOx are radiatively more efficient (per 1 Dobson unit ozone 
increment) than ozone enhancements due to ANOx. These calculations were done 
offline and for clear skies, where all meteorological parameters were held constant 
except for ozone. Therefore no temperature and water vapor feedbacks were allowed 
thus isolating the forcing due only to ozone enhancement. 
 The ozone distributions were calculated from two UMD-CTM simulations: 
one that included LNOx source and one with LNOx source turned off. These ozone 
distributions were used as input for the radiative forcing calculation using the 
Goddard radiative transfer model [Chou et al., 2001]. Future work could include 
performing an offline calculation of radiative forcing using the ozone distributions 
calculated by WRF-Chem and the same radiative transfer model. In addition, the 
radiative forcing could be calculated offline using the RRTM [Mlawer et al., 1997] to 
provide another estimate of radiative forcing thus accounting for some of the 
 
 
 
132 
uncertainty associated with radiative transfer calculations. Results from the online 
calculations, which also included temperature and water vapor feedbacks were 
discussed in sections 4.4.4 and 4.4.5. 
5.3.2  Short Term Impacts of Interactive Ozone 
Using an ensemble of ten simulations, we have shown that the importance of 
interactive ozone on the UT temperature at the national scale is cooling on the order 
of 0.2°C with standard deviation of 0.3°C with some increases in cloud cover. As the 
simulation times were increasing, the impact of interactive ozone grew. The 
differences at individual locations did not exceed 2°C on the time scale of our 
experiments (4 days, which is a typical length of regional scale operational 
forecasting). Reduced heating rate due to less ozone in interactive versus 
noninteractive simulation is responsible for the increasing magnitude of cooling in 
time, suggesting that this cooling effect is an important consideration at climate time 
scales. 
The use of interactive ozone enables feedback mechanisms: for example from 
chemistry (additional ozone due to LNOx) through radiation (changes in heating rate) 
to dynamics (changes in atmospheric instability and storm structure) and back to 
lightning (via convective updrafts and microphysics). The differences in simulations 
with and without interactive ozone may be explained by both improving the assumed 
ozone climatology in radiation schemes (with spatial and seasonal variability) as well 
as enabling these types of feedbacks. 
 
 
 
133 
Our 4-day simulations showed that temperature changes due to the additional 
ozone from LNOx were smaller than those due to inclusion of interactive ozone. We 
have not yet tested the impact of interactive ozone in cloud resolving simulations, 
which is beyond the scope of this project. With explicit convection the feedback 
mechanisms may play larger role. 
Our ensembles demonstrated that the UT cooling resulted in a 5% increase in 
cloud cover between the two simulations, due to increases in relative humidity in the 
UT. While interesting, this increase was obtained from simulations with relatively 
coarse resolution. Confirmation of this result with an ensemble of cloud resolving 
simulations would be worth exploring since the convection would be explicit rather 
than parameterized. Results from cloud resolving simulations could then be compared 
to cloud vertical profiles from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder 
Satellite Observation (CALIPSO). 
5.3.3  Temperature Response of Ozone due to LNOx in Climate Simulations 
Our simulations showed 22 ppbv increase in UT ozone due to LNOx. On our 
time scale the temperature response was mainly seen in the UT. We have shown that 
the instantaneous radiative forcing due to LNOx is about the same as the 
instantaneous radiative forcing since preindustrial times shown by Mickley et al. 
[2004]. They conducted climate equilibrium simulations (spun-up for 25 years and 
ran for 75 years) using a coarse resolution GISS model (4° × 5° and 9 vertical levels) 
and found that ~18 ppbv increase in ozone throughout the troposphere resulted in a 
temperature increase of 0.25°C–0.30°C throughout the troposphere when averaged 
 
 
 
134 
globally. It would be worth conducting climate simulations similar to Mickley et al., 
but with a high resolution global or regional chemistry climate model, to investigate 
the long term temperature response due to ozone resulting from LNOx. Further 
analysis could explore whether the flash rate has changed since preindustrial times 
and whether it will be different as climate changes. 
5.3.4  Wind Shear Climatology and New Lightning Scheme 
The maxima in lightning flash rates over Florida that are detected by the 
NLDN network are not as clearly seen in the satellite-retrieved NO2 columns 
(DOMINO v2 product) indicating that the flashes over the southeastern United States 
may be more tropical in nature and therefore producing less NO moles than their 
midlatitude counterparts. Most tropical thunderstorms have smaller vertical wind 
shear resulting in shorter flash lengths, which may lead to smaller NO production per 
flash [Huntrieser et al., 2009]. Further studies could investigate whether there is a 
significant difference between the wind shear of the storms in Florida and parts of the 
southeastern United States compared to more continental storms. If so, a new 
lightning algorithm could include wind shear as a predictor of NO production per 
flash. This could potentially result in better agreement with NO2 columns observed 
from space. 
5.3.5  Impact of Boundary Conditions on Surface Layer 
Mean regional ozone biases at the surface, as well as in the free troposphere, 
can be increased if a high O3 bias is introduced from a global CTM to lateral 
 
 
 
135 
boundary conditions [Tang et al., 2008; Yegorova et al., 2011]. The WRF-Chem 
community usually uses the output from the MOZART model when preparing initial 
and boundary conditions for trace gases. As part of this dissertation, we have 
developed new software that prepares initial and boundary conditions from the GMI 
CTM. Trace gases from the GMI CTM have not been used to drive regional air 
quality models before. This software can serve as a useful tool to investigate the 
impact of boundary conditions on air quality model performance and regional ozone 
biases. 
In order to drive WRF-Chem simulations with GMI-CTM trace gases, the 
GMI-CTM output needs to be provided at at least a 6-hour frequency The WRF-
Chem community would benefit if the GMI-CTM output were to be archived at this 
frequency. I have run the GMI-CTM using a graphical user interface on a computing 
facility at NASA; however, this is not an option for those who do not have access to 
the NASA computing facility. Ideally, the users would be able to run the GMI-CTM 
interactively on a website employing a similar graphical user interface.

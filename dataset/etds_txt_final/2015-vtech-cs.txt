Getting Lost in Email: How and Why Users Spend More Time in
Email than Intended.
Benjamin V. Hanrahan
Email has become deeply embedded in many users’ daily lives. To investigate how email
features in users lives, particularly how users attend to email and get lost within it, I ran ﬁve
studies that probed how users determined relevancy of messages, logged interactions with
email, gathered diary entries related to individual sessions, and investigated the gratiﬁca-
tions sought from email use. For the ﬁrst study, I performed an exploratory experiment in
the laboratory to determine how participants assessed the importance of individual emails
(N=10). The next investigation I undertook involved three diﬀerent studies, which I detail
individually: a survey on email usage (N=54); a two-week study of email usage (N=20); and
ﬁnally, the application of Attentional Network Test (N=9). My ﬁnal study was to validate
my ﬁndings around the reasons for attending to email, this was done through deploying a
survey that followed the Uses and Gratiﬁcation Theory tradition (N=52)
In my studies I found that the majority of attentional eﬀort is around reading email and
participating in conversations, as opposed to email management. I also found that partic-
ipants attended to email primarily based on notiﬁcations, instead of the number of unread
messages in their inbox. I present my results through answering several research questions,
and leverage Conversation Analysis (CA), particularly conversation openings, to explicate
several problematic aspects around email use. My ﬁndings point to ineﬃciencies in email
as a communication medium, mainly, around how summons are (or are not) issued. This
results in an increased burden on email users to maintain engagement and determine (or
construct) the appropriate moment for interruption.
My ﬁndings have several implications: email triage does not seem to be problematic for the
participants in my studies, somewhat in contrast to previous research; much of the problem
around email, particularly getting lost in email is in managing the tension between promptly
responding to messages while limiting engagement with email; due to the social nature of
the problems with email, modiﬁcations to the email client are limited in their potential
eﬀectiveness to prevent getting lost and reduce email related anxiety.

Introduction
Email has become deeply embedded in many people’s daily lives. Since its inception, email
has become an evermore ubiquitous and central tool, playing a part in many work and per-
sonal activities. Email is used to communicate with friends, family, and co-workers; interact
with automated systems; and to facilitate organization, coordination, and collaboration. It
is a core application in many of our most familiar personal computing devices. As a result
of all of these factors, email has become a staple for computer users and has received a great
deal of attention from both research and industry.
Much of this research and development has focused on the problems centered around email
overload [Whittaker and Sidner, 1996; McMurtry, 2014; Reinke and Chamorro-Premuzic,
2014;Sumeckiaetal.,2011;Grevetetal.,2014], namelyaroundthetriagingandmanagement
ofmessages[Whittakeretal.,2006]. Hence, theproblemofthesheeramountofemailspeople
can receive is well known, it can take a large amount of time to simply manage the volume.
However, an interesting related question is about the draw and disruption email can have
during our daily lives. There has been comparatively less research around how email features
in users’ daily lives, particularly how email attracts attention, how users attend to email
[Whittaker et al., 2006], engage in sessions, and employ strategies to manage their email
interaction. While researchers are addressing this gap, there are still calls for qualitative
studies around the ‘lived experiences’ of email [McMurtry, 2014].
Industry publications have noted the common problems with email such as those noted
above1, 2. They also propose several strategies in dealing with them, or even calls to action
about collectively reducing email use3, 4, 5. In many senses we are all very engaged with

the problem of email and the eﬀect that it can have on our daily lives. The concerns voiced
in the media have been echoed in research communities. Whether it is the breaking down
of boundaries associated with email use [Cecchinato et al., 2014], or the amount of time
it typically takes to re-engage with the interrupted task (24 minutes) [Hemp, 2009], or the
eﬀect on our productivity and well being [Chase and Clegg, 2011], or simply its propensity
to increase burn-out [Reinke and Chamorro-Premuzic, 2014].
To investigate the draw of email, I explore several themes. These themes relate to how email
features in users’ daily lives, particularly how email attracts attention and how users decide
to attend to email. To investigate the disruption of email, I explore what happens after users
decide to attend to email and to what degree they are aware of and manage their engagement
to minimize negative eﬀects. I further isolate a particular aspect of the disruption that email
can have on its users through investigating a phenomenon that I call getting lost in email.
Getting lost in email is the process of becoming further distracted from the original intent
of an email session. This phenomenon at its most basic is the loss of agency over one’s
attention during an email session, and is similar to the distraction chains identiﬁed by Iqbal
and Horvitz [2007].
InthisdissertationIreportthisinvestigationandmyﬁndingsintohowemailfeaturesinusers’
daily lives. Through this investigation I gain insight into how users are managing their email
and how it manages them (i.e. the way its design, functioning, and status within activities
and relationships inﬂuence user behavior). I seek to give a greater depth of understanding to
several aspects of how users attend to email and what they do once they are there, through
exploring several questions as the framework for this investigation.

1.1 Motivation
Asboththeamountofinformationusersencounterandthenumberoftoolstheyuseincrease,
guarding one’s attention during computer use has become increasingly important. This need
is particularly stark when coupled by the penchant for tools to compete for user attention
through numerous notiﬁcations that compel their use. This is in contrast to the initial
visions of Bush [1945], in which computers were meant to support work and aid in directing
one’s attention to the correct place, and not for applications to compete for user attention.
Clearly, researchers must come to a better understanding of how to support the direction of
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 1. Introduction 3
users’ attention and avoid compounding this problem.
Inordertobeabletosupportthedirectionofattentionacrosstheentiretoolset,wemustﬁrst
understand how individual tools capture and divert our attention in both constructive and
destructive ways. I argue that Personal Information Management (PIM) tasks, particularly
email management, provide an especially rich area for studying how attention is directed.
First, PIM tasks are often attention intensive activities that are rarely the primary task that
a user is engaged with. Knowledge workers don’t use computers just for the sake of emailing
documents or bookmarking web pages; instead these are sub-tasks in accomplishing larger
goals (e.g. writing a proposal, preparing a presentation, researching a topic on the web, or
programming an application). This means that PIM activities are situations where there is
increased pressure on attention. Email provides a salient example of such a PIM task due
to its ubiquity and centrality to work.
In 2011 and 2012 I conducted a series of studies which highlighted our lack of understanding
of why users feel overloaded by email and how they decide to attend to email. The ﬁrst
study investigated the saliency of diﬀerent cues within the inbox [Hanrahan, 2011] and the
ﬁndings were somewhat unexpected (this study is presented and the analysis expanded in
Chapter 5). My initial hypothesis was that social proximity, the relationship between the
receiver and sender, had a strong eﬀect on how long would it take to triage the message and
determine its level of importance. This assumption was based around a more established
common ground between the two parties. Instead, my ﬁndings indicate the decision was
based primarily on the topic of the email, not the sender, where a sender that occupied
multiple facets in one’s life seemed to be make the decision increasingly diﬃcult.
My next investigation was through the building of Procrastinate [Hanrahan and P´erez-
Quinones,2012],whichwasatoolthataimedtoremovevisualanchorstoprospectivememory
from the inbox. This was accomplished by purging already triaged messages from the inbox
and returning them to the inbox at a future date. While some of our initial set of pilot users
within our lab found this useful, others simply did not. Functionality very similar to our
concept has since found its way into applications such as MailPilot and Mailbox.
During this time I was also making heavy use of project management applications, many of
which are designed around philosophies similar to the Getting Things Done (GTD) method-
ology by David Allen [Allen, 2001]. In GTD users are encouraged to use diﬀerent contexts
and projects to group their work by, with the speciﬁc intent to enable practitioners to focus
on their current task. However, these tools require a high degree of initial investment and
maintenance to become valuable. Perhaps, a similarly large investment of time in optimizing
information practices is simply required to alleviate feelings of overload and this is why users,
designers, and researchers of email have had diﬃculty in making improvements. I claim that
a better understanding of attending to email and getting lost in email will provide valuable
insight into this diﬃcult problem and suggest methods for how to resolve it.

1.2 Domains Involved in Attending to Email
The question of how users engage and get lost in email intersects several domains of research.
This dissertation focuses on three primary domains, complemented by one common perspec-
tive covered in the related work. The domain that crosscuts and deﬁnes much of the existing
research in email is PIM. Within PIM, researchers have expended a considerable amount of
eﬀort investigating how users make use of email, particularly focusing on the triage of email.
This domain serves as a backdrop for my research.
The ﬁrst way that I look at email in this dissertation is as a destructive distraction or
interruption. This analysis focuses on how users’ cognitive resources are impacted by inter-
ruptions and to what degree these concepts help to explain attending to and getting lost in
email. Within this research I measure users’ attentional resources by leveraging work done
in psychology.
The second way that I examine email is to frame the phenomena around email through
conversation analysis (CA). I focus on how emails function similarly, or in contrast to,
summons over other conversational mediums in getting attention.
The ﬁnal manner that I use to examine email is as a media of consumption. This perspective
is analyzed through the uses and gratiﬁcations approach, which was originally developed to
analyze reasons for media consumption.
Below I scope each of these perspectives in more detail.
1.2.1 Personal Information Management
PIM researchers have investigated several topics over the course of its existence, however, a
large portion of the work has concerned itself with methods to support knowledge workers
in their information tasks [Bush, 1945; Lansdale, 1988; Jones, 2007]. Particularly, PIM
researchers have investigated how knowledge workers have managed communications, which
has become increasingly important as computers have gained in both power and acceptance.
With this greater power and acceptance new problems have emerged, such as information
overload [Schick et al., 1990; Whittaker and Sidner, 1996].
Within the study of personal communications, email has been chief among the investigative
eﬀorts, as the majority of tasks performed by today’s knowledge workers occur in email
[Ducheneaut and Bellotti, 2001; Whittaker et al., 2006, 2007]. As part of this study re-
searchers have sought to understand what actions users perform during email use [Dabbish
et al., 2005; Tyler and Tang, 2003; Wainer et al., 2011]. Researchers have also constructed
tools to assist in email management [Cselle et al., 2007; Fisher et al., 2006b; Nardi et al.,
2002]. Throughout these investigations, researchers have successfully studied Personal In-
formation Management through the examination of usage logs [Fisher and Dourish, 2004;
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 1. Introduction 5
Muller et al., 2010; Whittaker et al., 2011]. These same researchers have called for more
studies that examine Personal Information Management with more than just a snapshot of
data [Whittaker et al., 2011].
However, there has been a lack of understanding of how users engage with email and what
happens to a user once they engage with the email tool that leads them to feel overloaded.
Why are users compelled to engage with email?
1.2.2 Attention and Interruptions
The study of interruptions and distraction in Human Computer Interaction (HCI) is a well
established area of inquiry [Roda, 2011], particularly the eﬀect of interruptions on primary
tasks [Mcfarlane, 1998; McFarlane and Latorella, 2002]. Within this domain researchers
have sought to understand the impact of the length of the distraction chain resulting from
the interruption on primary task resumption [Iqbal and Horvitz, 2007; Czerwinski et al.,
2004], this work serves as an inspiration for getting lost in email. As the understanding of
the interruption process has increased researchers have proposed conceptual frameworks to
assist is designing more usable notiﬁcation systems, such as the IRC (interruption, reaction,
and comprehension) framework done by Chewar et al. [2004]. Notiﬁcations and distractions
have a clear connection with email use, therefore, these frameworks are relevant to this
research.
The study of attention is closely related to investigations within HCI on interruptions and
their eﬀect on the cognitive resources of the user. A widely accepted method for measuring
attention is the Attentional Network Test (ANT) [Fan et al., 2002].
Within this dissertation I examine two activities in regard to attention and interruption,
email notiﬁcations and the focusing of attention within the inbox. The primary reasons to
look at email as a distraction is to see whether there is some connection between personal
traits, for example as measured by ANT, and email use.
1.2.3 Conversation Analysis
As email is a medium where conversations can and do happen, I analyze the process of
attendingtoemailthroughtheuseofconversationanalysis(CA)[Sacksetal.,1992;Schegloﬀ,
2004, 1968]. CA is the analysis of social interactions through their structure and content.
I contrast aspects of email communication (i.e. how email grabs attention and how email
use plays out as sequences of interactions) with conversations from other media and outline
why certain similarities and diﬀerences contribute to and explain particular phenomena and
diﬃculties I observed. The contrast between mediums lends insight into how the use of
features of email have mixed consequences, or are simply unhelpful, for its users, and I
discuss how they might be changed.
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 1. Introduction 6
I explain decisions to attend to email through the discussion of email messages and their
presentation to users as both summonses and requests [Sacks et al., 1992; Schegloﬀ, 1968]. I
highlight decisions and strategies to attend to email to show that the nature of thought that
goes into email work appears variable, and outline how emails sometimes have features of a
summons to conversations or a request for attention.
1.2.4 Uses and Gratiﬁcations
Uses and Gratiﬁcations Theory (UGT) has been developed to explain various types of media
consumption. The roots of the theory can be tracked back to the work of Herzog [1944],
where she analyzed why housewives listened to radio soap operas. UGT has since been used
to analyze many types of media including, television, telephone, and print communication.
More recently it has been applied to Twitter [Chen, 2011], internet usage [Papacharissi and
Rubin, 2000], and social networking sites like Facebook [Park et al., 2009].
Relating this research to email, I apply this method to determine what the anticipated
gratiﬁcations of my participants are. Are they simply wanting to use email for functional
business purposes or are there other reasons? I answer questions as to whether or not users
project their professionalism. As well as, whether or not email use is only done to serve a
purpose or if it is also used in response to boredom or passing time.
1.3 Research Questions and Approach
In this dissertation I investigate two aspects of email use.
1. The decision to attend to email.
2. The activities performed while engaged with email.
Within the topic of deciding to attend to email, I investigate speciﬁc reasons for attending
to email within individual sessions, which gratiﬁcations are expected as a result of general
email use, and how features of email play in the decision to attend to email. In regard to
activities undertaken, I investigate what activities or attributes correlate with both session
length and the frequency of getting lost in email and why my participants were susceptible
to becoming lost.
ThissectionoutlinesthegeneralapproachIusedforthisinvestigation, theresearchquestions
I investigated, and my initial hypotheses around each research question.
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 1. Introduction 7
1.3.1 General Approach
Investigating email usage is problematic and investigating a speciﬁc phenomenon such as
attendingtoemailorgetting lost isevenmoreso. KellyandTeevan[2007]acknowledgethese
common problems to PIM research when they outline the diﬃculties in the uniqueness of
both personal information and practices, as well as the amount of change in these collections
from minute to minute. For this reason, I made use of a mixed method approach, with which
I was able to isolate the decision to attend to email, what activities occurred in email, when
participants became lost, and gain insight into why users make use of email. First, I surveyed
the participants about their email usage, perception, and demographic information. Within
this survey I recruited participants into the main part of the investigation, a two-week study
of their email usage. This study of email usage logged changes to the email corpus every
three minutes to determine which email actions, if any, the participant has performed. When
certain conditions had been met, a diary entry was dispatched via SMS. This diary entry
askedtheparticipantwhytheyinitiatedthesession, whetherornottheyhadgottenlost, and
what they did during the session. Lastly, I deployed an additional survey that determined
the gratiﬁcations expected to be gained from email use.
Generally, in my analysis I look at several sets of features and how they impact a speciﬁc
research question. These roughly group into three sets of features:
• predispositions, which includes aspects measured by the Attentional Networks tests
(Alerting, Orienting, and Executive Control), as well as, situational aspects (how many
projects the participant is involved in, upcoming deadlines, etc.);
• preconditions, including aspects such as number of unread messages, number of
messages replied to, diversity of senders, reasons for initiating the session, or if this
was an interruption.
• mitigating behaviors, including reading habits, ﬁling habits, or strategies.
1.3.2 RQ 1: When and how are users deciding to attend to email;
speciﬁcally, is it the result of user predisposition, precondi-
tions of email, mitigating behaviors, or social obligations?
There is high level of noise in the email channel and many emails are simply not important.
Are users having trouble distinguishing the noise in the email channel from the important
emails within the channel? Is there a measurable impact of user predisposition or precon-
ditions of email on the frequency of attending to email? Previous research established that
users of email are conscious of others’ projected response rhythms [Tyler and Tang, 2003],
this implies an amount of social obligation in email use. Are users attending to email because
the feel an obligation to respond to emails? Is the frequency of email use more a function of
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 1. Introduction 8
the user, the email load, or strategies that they employ to help manage email? Surely the
frequency with which users check email is a function of personal characteristics and the level
of email load.
The investigation of this research question gives insight into how haphazard or premeditated
the decision to attend to email is and how diﬃcult this process is.
Hypothesis
Users engage with email for several reasons, such as receiving a notiﬁcation, having a high
unread count, or engaging in routine sessions.
Ihypothesizethatthereisacomplexmixturebetweensituationswhereusersmakedeliberate,
premeditated decisions to engage with email and other situations, where they have been
pulledintotheapplicationinalessdeliberate,moresituationalmanner. Ifurtherhypothesize
that the activities of these diﬀerent types of sessions are noticeably diﬀerent in discernible
ways. I believe the situation around email is complex and nuanced, relating not only to
several features of the email content (and to an extent the technology itself), but also shaped
by a wider context of on-going relationships and activities.
Users are being distracted by spurious email notiﬁcations.
Even though I believe attending to email is a complex decision, notiﬁcations about even
unimportant emails develop an urge to check the email. Activity like this causes more
engagement with email that the user would prefer and brings them into email more, as
engagement with email begets further engagement.
Users have trouble ﬁltering through messages to ﬁnd the ones that must be read or replied to.
I hypothesize that as users have more unread emails in their inbox it becomes harder for
them to locate the important emails and the sessions become longer as a result.
Attentional network scores have a measurable impact on how often users check email and
become lost.
I hypothesize that we will see an eﬀect from the diﬀerent attentional network scores, partic-
ularly around the direction and mediation of attention in regard to getting lost.
1.3.3 RQ 2: What is the level of engagement that users are main-
taining with email when not actively using email and how
does this feature in their decision to attend to email?
How much are users of email thinking about email when they are not using email? How
does this feature in their decision to attend to email? Previous studies have shown that
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 1. Introduction 9
individuals that check email more often suﬀer less anxiety about email [Dabbish and Kraut,
2006], what about email use is causing this anxiety?
Hypothesis
Users of email maintain a background engagement with email throughout the day.
Due to the importance of email to our work, I hypothesize that users are required to have a
background awareness of email throughout their day. This background awareness is mostly
concerned with obligations to others, particularly superiors and important emails about
upcoming deadlines.
Users are aware of the time since they last checked email, and longer periods of inactivity
cause anxiety.
The unknown is what causes this anxiety, and the anxiety will be greater if there is some
amount of expectation.
1.3.4 RQ 3: Once users have decided to attend to email, what are
the activities, predispositions, or preconditions that corre-
late with longer sessions and how do these relate to getting
lost?
Once a user initiates an email session are there a particular set of activities that are more
likelytoresultinlongersessionsorgettinglostinemail? Arediﬀerentusersmorepredisposed
(as measured by the ANT or the gratiﬁcations that they expect) to getting lost? To what
extent does the initial state of the email client impact session length and getting lost in
email, is it simply a matter of the number of unread messages? Are there any behaviors that
can be identiﬁed that relate to a propensity to getting lost or longer sessions.
Hypothesis
The email state will have the most eﬀect on both the frequency and duration of use.
Ihypothesizethatthestrongestsignalswillcomefromthefeaturesoftheemailstate. Simply
because if there is less incoming email there is less reason to interact with email.
Users with more responsibilities will check email more often.
Even though the email state should be where the strongest signals originate from, users
with increased numbers of projects and responsibilities should spend more time checking
and interacting with email.
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 1. Introduction 10
Number of important unread messages trumps sheer number of unread messages on session
length and getting lost.
I hypothesize that the sheer number of unread messages will be a surprisingly poor signal for
the duration of an email session. Primarily because the amount of time that is required to
delete ten obviously unimportant emails, is presumably much smaller than the time required
to read one important email. I hypothesize that some activities, reading important mail, are
more conducive to getting lost than deleting spam.
User traits have an impact on whether or not users will get lost in any given email session.
Once users begin an email session, which earlier I hypothesized would be more inﬂuenced by
the email state, the likelihood that they will get lost will be mostly due to their individual
traits. How many projects that they are involved in, whether or not they have pending
deadlines, and their attentional characteristics.
Within these user traits I speciﬁcally hypothesize that the alerting network will be an impor-
tant signal. This is because the alerting network is associated with continuous performance
and vigilance tasks, as such, the interaction between the alerting network and the frequency
of getting lost will be due to both the number of times that they check email and their
propensity to notice more emails once in the email program.
Furthermore I hypothesize the orienting network will not have a signiﬁcant eﬀect, primarily
because of the similarity of the stimuli, in that emails are located in the same area of the
interface and are mostly similar in appearance.
A higher value for the executive control network will experience getting lost in email more
frequently. Primarily because these users will ﬁnd it easier to switch rule sets for which
emails are important during triage. This easier context switching will reduce the inertial
eﬀect of context switching Wickens and Hollands [1999a] and makes the handling of conﬂic-
tive evidence easier [Fan et al., 2002], which enables participants to consider more emails
important thus increasing the likelihood of getting lost. Participants that have more trouble
switching contexts and rule sets will be more likely to stay within the current context of
their work, reducing the likelihood of getting lost.
1.3.5 RQ 4: Are the gratiﬁcations that users expect out of their
email use related to personal or professional reasons and
how do these help to predict email use?
What are the reasons that users are making use of email? Is it only for professional use?
What gratiﬁcations are they expecting to receive from email and how do these expectations
correlate with email use?
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 1. Introduction 11
Hypothesis
Email use is driven by the need to communicate about work tasks.
I hypothesize that people are not using email as a primary method to keep in touch with
relatives and friends, that coordination has migrated to a diﬀerent medium. However, col-
laborating and communicating about work is still handled primarily through email and this
will be a main driver. Furthermore, this will be evidenced through the reported gratiﬁcations
and their power in explaining email use.
Email use is driven by the desire to project a professional appearance.
As email is a medium of communication and I hypothesize that it is used primarily for
professional purposes, face-work and the projection of responsiveness will be important and
powerful in explaining email use. We know that users are aware of others’ level of responsive-
ness [Tyler and Tang, 2003], it logically follows that they are mindful about their projection
of responsiveness as well.
1.4 Goals and Key Contributions

of that engagement.
1.4.1 Contributions to Research
This study utilized a novel method for studying email and capturing diﬃcult phenomena.
The study of PIM is diﬃcult for several reasons [Kelly and Teevan, 2007], in that it is heavily
situated in one’s personal information and practices. Any attempt at studying a phenomena
must take this in to account. In my work I was able to pinpoint several interesting moments
duringtheuseofemailwithminimalimpacttomyparticipants. Thismethodofinvestigating
email, discussed in Section 3, can be used to identify additional phenomena in the future.
In my work I also take (or refresh) the perspective of email as a conversational medium.
Based on my research, conversations, and both participating in them and identifying them,
are clearly the activity that takes the most time and causes the most anxiety. Framing email
in this way also gives more insight into how email features in the lives of its users.
An additional contribution of my work is in extending the phenomena of distraction chains
[Iqbal and Horvitz, 2007] and identifying the phenomena of getting lost in email. Aside from
identifying this phenomena I have substantiated that it exists and occurs rather frequently.
As well as, identifying several causes for becoming lost in email.
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 1. Introduction 12
1.4.2 Contributions to Practice
The contribution of this work to practitioners is primarily in terms of insight into the design
of email, and secondarily in the design of conversational mediums.
In terms of the design of email, I have identiﬁed in what ways features of email are problem-
atic to its users and suggested features that may help to alleviate this. One of these features
has a direct line drawn from our initial paper to a developed product.
In terms of designing new conversational mediums, great care will need to be taken that it
satisﬁes the diﬀerent needs of conversations established here. The easy identiﬁcation of and
participation in a conversation, is clearly needed.
1.5 A Guide to this Dissertation
My ﬁndings around these questions are that there is a complex mixture between situations
where users make deliberate, premeditated decisions to engage with email and other situa-
tions, where they have been pulled into the application in a less deliberate, more situational
manner. In Chapter 4, I discuss my analysis of the reasons to check email as reported by my
participants; these primarily include receiving a notiﬁcation, expecting a communication,
or engaging in routine sessions. In my analysis of these reasons, Section 4.8, I outline how
the potential for distraction in email communication has similarities and stark diﬀerences
from other communication channels (e.g. over the phone), and how the design of email either
mitigates or contributes to these diﬀerences.
I further discuss in what ways email lends itself to getting lost and spend more time in email
than initially intended in Chapter 6. In Chapter 7, I theorize that email has this potential
because it is fundamentally diﬀerent from more primary, focused interfaces like document
based applications (Word, Excel, etc.), in that email is relevant to all of the user’s current
contexts. This means that email is a meta-contextual tool, in that all of a user’s contexts are
interleaved throughout the interface, in contrast to a tool like Word which typically involves
working on a document that belongs to a single context.
These various results evidence that the situation around email is complex and nuanced,
relating not only to several features of the email content (and to an extent the technology
itself), but also shaped by a wider context of on-going relationships and activities.
As the phenomenon of email use is complex and involves several diﬀerent interesting mo-
ments, I utilize several perspectives to investigate particular moments in the process. I
discuss each of them individually before addressing them in their entirety to construct a
more complete picture of how users engage with email than previously understood. First,
in Chapter 4, I report the analysis of my primary study as to why users are choosing to
engage with email and the distraction or interruption and draw it can have. In Chapter 5,
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 1. Introduction 13
I report the results of a pilot study designed to determine how users determine an email is
important. In Chapter 6, I analyze the same study through investigating the activities that
participants engage in during an email session, with a focus on how participants become lost
in email during certain sessions. In Section 4.7, I look at email as a media from the uses
and gratiﬁcation perspective and explore for what reasons users are using email. Finally, in
Chapter 7, I tie these studies together to construct a coherent view of the process of engaging
with email and becoming lost.

Literature Review
2.1 Personal Information Management
In the mid twentieth century, even as computing technology was in its infancy, researchers
wereinvestigatinghowthesenewdevicescouldassistusersinorganizingtheinformationthey
encountered throughout the day. In ‘As We May Think’ Bush [1945] introduced the Memex,
which was an exploration of how a personal computer could capture the trails of information
that knowledge workers left as they performed their research and work. Englebart [1962]
furtheredthedevelopmentofthisconceptwhenhepostulatedthattheupcomingtechnologies
wouldenablefurtheraugmentationstoourintellect. Hisvisionofassistingworkersindealing
with the various bits of information that we both encounter and use to interact with others,
led to developing some of the ﬁrst personal computers.
As technology pushed forward, researchers recognized the need for further, more focused
investigations into how knowledge workers organized their information. One of the ﬁrst of
these investigations was done by Malone [1983], when he studied how knowledge workers
organized their desks. The ﬁndings in this research lead to the ﬁrst usage of the phrase
Personal Information Management in 1988, when Lansdale [1988] coined the term.
Since its inception, the Personal Information Management ﬁeld of research has investigated
several topics ranging from music organization to note taking. Within these investigations,
Personal Information Management researchers have been particularly concerned with meth-
ods to support knowledge workers in their information tasks [Bush, 1945; Lansdale, 1988;
Jones, 2007]. One particular area in this body of research explores how knowledge work-
ers manage their communications, an increasingly important problem as computers have
gained in both power and acceptance. Coupled with this increase in power and acceptance
users have experienced a drastic increase in the number of communications that they receive
each day, causing new problems to emerge, e.g. information overload [Schick et al., 1990;
Whittaker and Sidner, 1996].

Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 2. Literature Review 15
Within the study of personal communications, email has been chief among the investigative
eﬀorts, as the majority of tasks performed by today’s knowledge workers either occur on or
pass through email [Ducheneaut and Bellotti, 2001; Whittaker et al., 2006, 2007]. As part of
this study researchers have sought to understand what actions users perform during email
use [Dabbish et al., 2005; Tyler and Tang, 2003; Wainer et al., 2011]. Researchers have also
constructed various tools to assist in email management [Cselle et al., 2007; Fisher et al.,
2006b;Nardietal.,2002]. Throughouttheseinvestigations,anincreasinglypopularapproach
for researchers studying Personal Information Management, particularly in studying email,
is the examination of usage logs [Fisher and Dourish, 2004; Muller et al., 2010; Whittaker
et al., 2011]. Some researchers have even called for even more studies to utilize more than
just a snapshot of data [Whittaker et al., 2011].
However, eventhoughtherehasbeenalargeamountofresearchintocommunicationthrough
email, there is still a marked lack of understanding in the process of attending to email: why
do users choose to check email; what happens to a user once they engage with email; and do
these factors contribute to them feeling overloaded? As these questions are investigated and
unpacked we should be able to answer many similar questions. For example, do diﬀerent
users feel more overloaded by similar amounts of email and what factors of the incoming
email impact the feeling of overload?
2.1.1 Deﬁnition of Personal Information Management
The term Personal Information Management has been deﬁned and used in various ways,
spurring some debate as to what exactly constitutes Personal Information Management
research. This ambiguity is due in part to the relatively wide swath that the ﬁeld cuts across
various research topics in Human-Computer Interaction and beyond. The phrase ‘Personal
Information Management’ ﬁrst appeared when Lansdale [1988] deﬁned it in a very general
sense:
[...] personal information not necessarily in the sense that it is private, but
that we have it for our own use. We own it, and would feel deprived if it were
taken away.
In the introduction from the book ‘Personal Information Management’ Jones and Teevan
provide the following deﬁnition:
Personal information management or Personal Information Management is
both the practice and study of the activities people perform to acquire, organize,
maintain, retrieve, use, and control the distribution of information items such
as documents (paper-based and digital), Web pages, and email messages for
everyday use to complete tasks (work-related and not) and to fulﬁll a person’s
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 2. Literature Review 16
various roles (as parent, employee, friend, member of community, etc.). [Jones
and Teevan, 2007]
Bellotti et al. [2002] provided another narrower deﬁnition of Personal Information Manage-
ment in the context of reﬁnding things:
[T]he ordering of information through categorization, placement, or embel-
lishment in a manner that makes it easier to retrieve when it is needed.
Jones et al. [2008] also developed a broad categorization of information to be considered
Personal Information Management, including, information controlled by, about, directed
toward, sent by, experienced by, and relevant to the user. The debate about what is PIM
and what is not PIM is ongoing and not likely to be resolved. However, as far as this
dissertation is concerned, there is a clear consensus that email is certainly PIM, and is
central to understanding PIM.
2.1.2 Importance of Studying Personal Information Management
As a ﬁeld of inquiry, Personal Information Management is becoming increasingly important
as we encounter more information. As time has progressed computers have gained a level
of ubiquitous acceptance that has contributed to an exponential growth in the amount of
information generated by users. However, as Levy [2005] noted our attentional resources
have remained essentially stagnant.
Thisincreaseofinformationcoupledwithastagnationofbothattentionalandotherresources
(e.g. time) has resulted in users experiencing information overload [Schick et al., 1990].
Information overload has particularly manifested itself in email, established by Whittaker
and Sidner [1996]. As time progressed the ubiquity and centrality of email to the work of
knowledge workers increased, resulting in an increase in the number of emails encountered
on a daily basis. This increase in emails and experience of information overload established
by Whittaker, was again replicated by Fisher et al. [2006a], where he found that the number
of emails that workers receive had increased over the last decade. Interpolating the data
provided by these two studies and extending the trend into another decade, one would
expect that information overload has only increased and its eﬀects worsened. Especially
whencoupledwith thelargenumberof newsourcesofinformationthathave beenintroduced
and adopted since 2006. Interestingly, in the midst of this increase the design of email has
remained virtually unchanged over the decades.

2.1.3 Study of Email
Email is an important tool worthy of study and has been called one of the most successful
computer applications [Whittaker and Sidner, 1996; Dabbish and Kraut, 2006; Whittaker
et al., 2007]. It is considered to be a common, if not critical, part of everyday life for many,
especially at work [Whittaker et al., 2011; Wainer et al., 2011; Mackay, 1988; Fisher et al.,
2006a; Ducheneaut and Watts, 2005; Dabbish et al., 2005]. As such it has a long history
of research in its forty years of existence and there have been many tools proposed to help
users once they are in the inbox [Freed et al., 2008; Whittaker et al., 2004; Venolia and
Neustaedter, 2003; Nardi et al., 2002; Cselle et al., 2007; Faulring et al., 2010]. While many
of these tools have centered around email triage, Vacek [2014] has recently reiterated the
call for better email triaging tools. However, Kokkalis et al. [2013] (in creating EmailValet,
where task detection was done by the crowd) questioned the utility of the better detection,
hypothesizing that it may be causing extra, unnecessary work. A slightly diﬀerent tool,
MinEMail [Rector and Hailpern, 2014], layered an additional level of notiﬁcation for more
important senders. Singh et al. [2013], posits that the problems around email are caused
by its inability to scale to the volume of emails we receive, as it was designed to mimic
paper-based workﬂows.
Email is also a place to do work. Researchers have both studied and proposed several re-
imaginings of the inbox in terms of the tasks that are contained within it. Gwizdka [2000,
2002] called for more explicit support for tasks within the email client, citing the propensity
of its users to use it in a variety of ways and in a variety of temporal aspects. Bellotti et al.
[2003] created a system that brought task management very prominently to the inbox.
Even though email is a place of work, increased engagement with email increases feelings
of overload [Sumeckia et al., 2011]. Other studies have also identiﬁed that email volume
contributes to email stress, as well as worrying about email [Jerejian et al., 2013]. Along
these lines I seek to understand what the source of worry within email is and what are the
causes for increased use.
Researchers have also proposed changes to the practices rather than tools. Chase and Clegg
[2011] proposed that users better manage sender expectations. Others have called for orga-
nizational training courses [McMurtry, 2014], or to put limits on email as a company or an
individual [Hemp, 2009]. Bradley et al. [2013] found evidence for the eﬃcacy of these types
of approaches in reducing email stress, when they found that infrequent checking is better
than frequent checking for email related stress. Although, this is somewhat in contrast to
the ﬁndings of Dabbish and Kraut [2006], where it was found that frequently checking email
reduced email related stress.
There are mixed signals emerging from the research into email use. As such, with this
study I endeavor to bring understanding to a key point of email use, how users decide to
attend to email. I link qualitative insights about the reasons participants engaged with
email with quantitative insights into what types of actions cause lengthier sessions. While
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 2. Literature Review 18
I acknowledge that not all of these sessions are necessarily destructive, I cite the literature
above to substantiate my general use of increased email usage as a concern.
Researchersintheareahavealsoproposedmultipleframeworkstoassistinunderstandingthe
topography of research activities. Ducheneaut and Watts [2005] proposed several metaphors
for email, a ﬁle cabinet, production line, or communication genre. Whittaker et al. [2007]
divide email into activities of allocating attention, deciding actions, managing tasks, and
organizing messages into folders. I ﬁnd Whittaker et al. [2007] to be particularly useful in
highlighting the lack of knowledge in how users decide when and why to attend to email. In
fact, when Whittaker et al. proposed this framework they highlighted that there has been
“relatively little systematic study of what causes people to attend to their email” [Whittaker
et al., 2007, p. 172]. This was further echoed by McMurtry [2014], who called for more
qualitative studies around the ‘lived experience’ of email. Rennecker and Derks [2013] also
call for more multi-dimensional investigations of email overload that look at more than just
email length or the number of emails.
Whittaker et al. [2007] further divide the allocation of attention into (1) the decision of when
and why to attend to email and (2) deciding which messages to attend to once the user has
entered into the email client.
When and Why Users Attend to Email
One of the more informative pieces on how users decide to attend to email was done by
Mackay [1988], where she performed extensive interviews of oﬃce workers in order to gain
a richer understanding of their email habits. Among Mackay’s ﬁndings were the strategies
that the diﬀerent participants used in attending to email. A few of the users she interviewed
strictly managed their engagement with email, citing that they read it only two times a day
allowing “mail to accumulate and read it only when convenient” [Mackay, 1988, p. 388].
However, the majority of her users reported that they read mail as soon as it arrived and
were constantly engaged with it.
Another relevant study was conducted by Czerwinski et al. [2004], where they conducted
a diary study focused around task switching and interruptions. They found that 23% of
tasks reported by their participants were email tasks. I draw inspiration from this study in
my work, but instead aim my diary studies directly at email and link the diaries to speciﬁc
usage sessions. This helps to minimize the amount of work needed by participants, in this
way I try to avoid the so-called “Heisenberg-style” challenge mentioned by Czerwinski et al.
[2004], where heavily measuring a phenomenon can change it. I also diﬀerentiate from this
study in that I prompt for diary entries as opposed to depending on participants to choose
which sessions they complete a diary entry for.
The eﬀects of constantly attending to email have been explored by several researchers. For
example, Ducheneaut and Bellotti [2001] portray email as a habitat, which is indicative of
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 2. Literature Review 19
the amount of attention that is allocated by users. As part of their work, they highlighted
the network eﬀect that results when a group of workers attend to email. As more workers
attend and use email, the need arises for the same group to attend to email in increasing
amounts. That is, email use feeds itself. Whittaker and Sidner [1996] also touch on the
topic in that they recognize users must spend a large amount of time in email due to the
sheer quantity of email they deal with. Further support for concern over users’ allocation of
attention comes from Dabbish et al. [2005] who found that university members check their
email an average of 19 times a day. Later, Dabbish and Kraut [2006] found this behavior of
frequent email checking to reduce email-related stress, somewhat in contrast to the ﬁndings
of Bradley et al. [2013]. Venolia et al. [2001] found that more than half of their participants
keep their mail client visible at least two-thirds of their work time.
A related area of research is the study of the negative eﬀects of interruptions to work. This
research has focused on areas such as interruptions from email, instant messaging appli-
cations, general notiﬁcations, and how users recover from interruptions [Mcfarlane, 1997a;
Czerwinski et al., 2000a; Cutrell et al., 2001a; Franke et al., 2002a; Adamczyk and Bailey,
2004; Mark et al., 2008; Hemp, 2009]. This research helps motivate the need for studying
why users of email choose to attend to email, even at the detriment to their productivity and
work. In addition, the various, sometimes contradicting ﬁndings of email research, points to
the diversity and variety in these phenomena.
An additional relevant area of research is the research around notiﬁcations. Work has been
done to determine how notiﬁcations should attune to the attention of the user [McCrickard
et al., 2003a], how users recover from notiﬁcations [Iqbal and Horvitz, 2007], as well as
how notiﬁcations aﬀect users [Cutrell et al., 2001a]. This area of research is helpful to my
research both from a methodological standpoint and in terms of insight from a more general
viewpoint.
How Users Decide Which Messages to Attend to
The next division of attention allocation that Whittaker et al. [2007] propose is deciding
which messages to attend to. This work is relevant to this dissertation as it gives additional
insight into how users decide which emails are important and gives some insight into the
reasons users have for using email.
The number of incoming email messages that users receive on a daily basis has been es-
tablished as a problem by the Personal Information Management community over the last
15 years. Whittaker and Sidner [1996] ﬁrst established this problem of email overload in
1996. A decade later, Fisher et al. [2006a] found incoming mail messages had nearly doubled
from a mean of 49 daily incoming messages to a mean of 87 amongst knowledge workers.
Additionally, Fisher found that email archives had grown ten fold in the same time frame,
from a mean of 2,482 total messages to a mean of 28,660 total messages per user. There
have been several eﬀorts to help alleviate the pain of email management by the Personal
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 2. Literature Review 20
Information Management and Computer Supported Cognitive Work community, however,
users of email have seen little to no improvement [Ducheneaut and Watts, 2005].
These studies point to a problem in email management. One process of concern is email
triage,theprocessbywhichuserssurveyandassessemailsanddetermineanyactionrequired.
Much of the research done to combat this area has focused either on social relationships
with the sender, ContactMap [Nardi et al., 2002] and SNARF [Neustaedter et al., 2005],
or has instead focused on the topic or subject of the email, BuzzTrack [Cselle et al., 2007].
Examining the process of email triage armed with the models and frameworks provided by
situated cognition, signal detection theory, and decision making can help us to understand
what pieces of information the recipients of an email use to make decisions about relevance.
Email triage has been recognized as a diﬃculty to users for over a decade [Whittaker and
Sidner, 1996], and there have been several attempts to alleviate this problem. There are
patterns that have been identiﬁed, such as the desire to maintain an image of responsiveness
[Tyler and Tang, 2003] that may eﬀect these decisions as well. Particularly of interest are the
eﬀorts to make users more aware of their social structures and topics that they are interested
in during email use.
One study, performed by Fisher and Dourish [2004], involved presenting social structures
constructed by information dissemination to participants. These social structures were the
representationofhowadocumentwasdisseminatedthroughanorganization. Oneexampleis
the onion structure, where the document’s distribution was represented as concentric circles
around a central source. Upon reviewing these social structures participants were able to
recall richer information about the events and provide insight into the structure. Another
project focused on leveraging social information for email triage was SNARF (the Social
NetworkandRelationshipFinder)[Neustaedteretal.,2005]. SNARFextendedFisher’swork
utilizing the deducted strength of relationships and performing a social sort. This situated
the message within the social order for the recipient. Later work utilizing SNARF found
that the social sorting functionality did little to decrease participant’s feelings of overload
[Fisher et al., 2006b].
A project focused on better situating the individual messages a participant has received
within conversations that they are involved in, focused primarily on the sequencing of the
messages [Venolia and Neustaedter, 2003]. The authors concluded that their design was not
suited for most conversations and was unable to alleviate many of the problems experienced
by users and suggested more work needs to be done.
Another path that some researchers have taken is to provide better information about the
topics, as done by Cselle et al. [2007] in their work with BuzzTrack. BuzzTrack is an email
plugin that groups messages not by subject, but by a topic that the system had determined.
Users were then given control on merging or renaming the suggested topics. However, to
this author’s knowledge no user studies have been performed as of yet using this system.
Wainer et al. [2011] found that inbox-level cues such as importance indicators as well as
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 2. Literature Review 21
curiosityhadaneﬀectonusers’decisiontoattendtomessages. Inthe“Bifrost”toolbyB¨alter
and Sidner [2002], emails were categorized based on factors like the number of recipients,
user-deﬁned importance of sender, and direct vs. cc messages in order to facilitate attending
to diﬀerent messages. Nardi et al. [2002] developed ContactMap to provide some support for
allocating attention between messages by displaying whether the user had new mail from a
contact on their contact card. Bellotti et al. [2005] also touched on allocating users’ attention
between emails, but they focused more on helping users ﬁnd incomplete tasks in their inbox.
Venolia et al. [2001] developed a user interface that indicated which messages in a complex
thread were either read or unread, which also helped users to decide which messages to
attend to. Gwizdka [2000, 2002] found that users attend to messages in diﬀerent temporal
manners, sometimes prospective, retrospective or ephemerally.
The divergent paths of research on email triage and management are an indication that this
process is not completely understood. One of the contributions of this dissertation is to
elucidate the information that recipients of email use to situate the information into their
daily lives. Speciﬁcally, I present a study that explores the role of social context in situating
an individual email message, as well as, investigating speciﬁc reasons for attending to email
as a whole.
2.2 Attention and Distraction
The relevant literature on human attention explores how humans allocate attentional re-
sources to perform tasks or events [Cutrell et al., 2000]. C.D. Wickens’ classic book on
Engineering Psychology [Wickens and Hollands, 1999b] devotes a full chapter to human at-
tention. The topic continues to be relevant in today’s digital environment, as evidenced by
a recent collection of readings on the topic [Roda, 2011].
InthissectionIﬁrstgiveanoverviewofsomeimportantconceptsthatareusedinattentional
models. Next I go over research studying interruptions and distractions in the computer en-
vironment. Following this I review mechanisms that are relevant to my research: prospective
memory, vigilance tasks, and dual tasks.
For the purposes of this research, I am taking the perspective of attention taken by the
Attentional Network Test (ANT) developed by Posner’s group [Fan et al., 2002]. In this
model attention is divided into three diﬀerent attentional networks: alerting, orienting, and
executive control. The authors deﬁne alerting as “achieving and maintaining an alert state;”
orienting as “the selection of information from sensory input;” and executive control as
“resolving conﬂict among responses.” This model is well substantiated as Posner’s group has
developed the Attentional Network Test to separately identify the traits of each participants
individual network.
An additionally relevant development is CopyCat which was developed by Hofstadter [1995].
CopyCat models attention in terms of codelets, meaning diﬀerent items request attention
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 2. Literature Review 22
based on how much it activates long term conceptual memory. ‘Unhappy’ objects are objects
that make few connections to long term conceptual memory and request more attention for
sensemaking. This could help to explain some of the ﬁndings by Wainer et al. [2011], where
they found curiosity to be a primary driver for selecting individual messages to read.
2.2.1 Working Memory
The concept of working memory is used in many attentional models, as one of its primary
features is that it is susceptible to degradation from interruptions.
Working memory is comprised of three components according to Baddeley’s model [Wick-
ens and Hollands, 1999c; Baddeley, 1995]. The three components are: the phonological
store, which holds auditory information; the spacial store, which holds visual and spatial
information; and the central executive, which controls activity and provides attention.
The phonological and spacial stores work cooperatively together, however, interference does
occur within the individual codes. That is, completing two tasks, one that is spatial in
nature and one that is auditory in nature results in minimal interference between the tasks.
However, if completing two auditory tasks simultaneously there is a degradation in perfor-
mance that can be attributed to the interference within the phonological store of working
memory [Wickens and Hollands, 1999c].
Similar to the two stores in working memory, the central executive can also experience
interference. However, this interference is a bit diﬀerent in its nature. While the central
executive is distributing working memory and attentional resources, it will be interfered
with if the task that it is delegating for execution is not automatic. Interference occurs if the
task requires more resources than required by a task that has been rehearsed to automaticity
[Wickens and Hollands, 1999c].
There are several relatively well established limitations of working memory both in duration
and capacity. The duration of working memory storage, without rehearsal, is around 20
seconds and the capacity is limited to 7±2 chunks [Wickens and Hollands, 1999c].
2.2.2 Resource Theory
The resource metaphor for attention and memory was introduced by Norman and Bobrow
[1975] and is explained in detail by Wickens and Hollands [1999b]. This metaphor is one
of the more complete ways to conceptualize how human attention works and many theories
build on top of the resource metaphor in some way.
Basically, this theory posits that while performing a task, we must devote a portion of
our limited attentional resources to the task. When performing multiple tasks, resources
are distributed unevenly among tasks (more diﬃcult tasks requiring more resources), which
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 2. Literature Review 23
helpstoexplainthedegradationinperformancewhenmultitasking. Additionally,attentional
resources are also required to switch between tasks, so more frequent task switching requires
more resources. The attention required for multitasking varies based on how similar or
dissimilar the tasks are, similarity between tasks can increase confusion and the resources
being used.
In general, an increase in the amount of required resources leads to a decrease in performance
and/or an increase in eﬀort. This relationship can be described as either a trade-oﬀ between
eﬀort and performance or task load and errors. That is, depending on the complexity of the
tasks the increased load on attentional resources may manifest itself in several ways. For
simple tasks, an increase in eﬀort is required to maintain acceptable performance across the
tasks. For complex tasks, an increase in the number of errors or time required to complete
the task will be the result of spreading attentional resources across tasks. To quote C.D.
Wickens:
The act of time-sharing itself pulls resources away from tasks above and be-
yond the resources that each task demands by itself. Thus, time-sharing, even
with no resources allocated to the other task, produces worse performance than
the single-task condition [Wickens and Hollands, 1999b, page 370].
An aspect of resource theory that is somewhat contentious, is the competing theories of at-
tentional resources being comprised of either a single-resource or multiple-resources [Wickens
and Hollands, 1999b]. Where single-resource theory refers to all of the attentional resources
being of the same type, thus capacity or available resources come from the same pool and
multiple resource theory being comprised of the three aforementioned types of resources that
provide the ability for some types of multitasking to be easier than others.
For the purposes of the research presented in this dissertation, it is not important to which
one of these two theories the reader subscribes to. This is primarily because the types of
tasks I am exploring are similar in structure and content, thus there is a large amount of
competition for resources and confusion between tasks regardless of whether the user has
one or several pools of resources. Both the primary and the secondary tasks, are done on
the computer, using the same type of perceptual sensor (reading the screen) and using the
same type of response (typing on the keyboard or moving the mouse). In summary, the tasks
that I will be studying are so similar, that I expect much conﬂict between them in either the
single or multiple-resource contexts.
2.2.3 Visual Attention
Attention, especially in the context of a computer, is often guided by visual attention [Wick-
ens and Hollands, 1999d]. In regards to email, there is often a visual indicator that seeks
to capture the attention of its users. These notiﬁcations take advantage of the manner in
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 2. Literature Review 24
which visual attention is directed. Speciﬁcally, visual attention enters a search mode when
the eyes seek out a target. There are two methods of visually acquiring the target: pursuit,
during which the eye follows a moving target; and saccadic where the target is somewhat
ﬁxed and the eye jumps to acquire it. Clearly, email notiﬁcations appeal to the later of the
two.
Human factors engineers have developed various methods for grabbing attention using visual
cues[WickensandHollands,1999d]. Oneexample,istodividethedisplayspaceintodiﬀerent
channels to grab attention for diﬀerent purposes. This is a reason why email notiﬁcations
appear in a consistent place around the screen.
However, visual attention does not always correlate with where the eye is focused, humans
are able to shift the focus of their attention on something in the periphery of their vision.
The attentional spotlight metaphor developed by Posner [1980], states that attention can be
shifted around the visual ﬁeld in the manner of a spotlight without moving the eye.
Therehasbeenadditionalworkthatfocusesonhowhumansprocessinformationbothserially
and in parallel as we scan information [Wolfe, 1994]. This is relevant in the case of email
triage in that, according to this work, we are able to process the diﬀerent cues, e.g. colors
and text, in parallel, not just serially reading each message.
2.2.4 Interruptions and Distractions
Mcfarlane [1997b] studied interruptions and the manner in which they increased the cost in
user performance in interactive systems [Mcfarlane, 1998; Franke et al., 2002b; McFarlane
and Latorella, 2002]. He found, in general, that interruptions demand the knowledge worker
make a context switch, as they shift their attention from one task to another. This context
switch increases the cognitive load of dealing with the work at the moment, which causes the
overallworkloadtoincrease. Thisincreaseinworkloadisassociatedwithahigherprobability
of errors [Franke et al., 2002b].
The research that I am reporting is similarly investigating the impact of the context switch
and the resulting increase of cognitive workload. However, and diﬀerent from the work done
by McFarlane, my research is explicitly investigating internal interruptions, that is, inter-
ruptions that initiate within the knowledge worker. I argue that this is a typical scenario for
Personal Information Management tasks, and leads to many expensive external interrup-
tions due to the diﬀerent Personal Information Management related tools (i.e. email giving
indicators of unread emails). Thus, in addition to “managing [external] interruptions” [Mc-
farlane, 1998; Franke et al., 2002b; McFarlane and Latorella, 2002] I need to understand how
internal interruptions lead to external interruptions in Personal Information Management
tools.
MaryCzerwinski, EdCutrellandEricHorvitzatMicrosofthavedoneextensivestudiesofthe
impact of interruptions in HCI environments [Cutrell et al., 2000; Czerwinski et al., 2000b;
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 2. Literature Review 25
Cutrell et al., 2001b; Czerwinski and Horvitz, 2002; Czerwinski et al., 2004, 2006; Cutrell
et al., 2000]. In one such study [Cutrell et al., 2000], they found that being interrupted
by an instant message while doing a web search task could have diﬀerent eﬀects depending
on where in the search task the interruption took place, and depending on the similarity
of the interruption to the task at hand. In their work, as in other interruption literature,
the similarity of the interruption to the task at hand has a direct impact on the cost of the
interruption. They report that if the interruption is relevant to the task at hand, the eﬀect
is less disruptive than if the interruption is irrelevant. The types of interruptions they used
in this study are all external interruptions.
Czerwinski et al. [2000b], similarly reported that interruptions have diﬀerent impacts on the
taskathanddependingonthetaskphasesthatareinterrupted. Theirworkconﬁrmsprevious
ﬁndings reported in the literature and provides support for systems that might provide
automated assistance based on rules about when to report an interruption. Czerwinski
et al. [2004] further studied task switching for information workers, acknowledging that some
interruptions observed were self-guided (internal), but their study only focused on external
interruptions.
A considerable amount of work has been done in the area of interruptions and distractions
in the form of notiﬁcations. McCrickard’s group at Virginia Tech has contributed several
advancements to this area in the form of attenuated systems [McCrickard et al., 2003a;
McCrickard and Chewar, 2003], investigating multitasking goals [McCrickard et al., 2003b],
and the IRC (interruption, reaction, and comprehension) framework [Chewar et al., 2004].
2.2.5 Prospective Memory
Another aspect of memory that is relevant to my research is prospective memory, which is
where humans hold events to be remembered in the future. More speciﬁcally, it is “remem-
bering to remember” [Roda, 2011]. I hypothesize that this memory is a primary source of
internal interruptions for knowledge workers.
Therehasbeenarelativelylargeamountofresearchinstudyingthemechanicsofprospective
memory. The four phases of the prospective memory mechanism [Roda, 2011], as related to
personal information management tasks with which I am concerned are:
• Intention formation - this is the point of realization that the user is going to have to
handle some event at a later time;
• Intention retention - this is the period between planning to handle the do the task and
actually doing the task;
• Intention initiation - when the user actually starts the task; and
• Intention execution - actually doing the task.
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 2. Literature Review 26
2.2.6 Vigilance
Vigilance tasks are relevant to email, as keeping situational awareness of one’s inbox can
be thought of as a vigilance task. Vigilance tasks are described by Wickens and Hollands
[1999e] as requiring the user to keep watch of one or more stimuli. This relates to keeping
track of incoming mail for users of email to maintain situational awareness.
There are several diﬀerent types of vigilance, free response, inspection, successive, simultane-
ous, sensory, and cognitive. In this work I am most interested in the free-response vigilance
task, when events can happen at any time. I am also interested in cognitive vigilance tasks,
for example reading an email or determining whether or not to read an email.
2.2.7 Primary and Secondary Tasks
Primary and secondary tasks are a special, limited case of multitasking. In this research I am
concerned with the primary and secondary task in that the primary task is interrupted and
the secondary task displaces the primary task. Wickens describes the situation, “When the
primary task is emphasized in a dual-task situation, the concurrent task is called a secondary
task.” [Wickens and Hollands, 1999a, page 443].
The costs of switching between the primary and secondary have been shown to be relatively
costly, especially in more stressful conditions [Wickens and Hollands, 1999a, page 445]. Due
to this cost there is an inertia eﬀect, where users avoid the cost of switching by continuing
a lower-priority task than is optimal.
2.3 Conversation Analysis
Research in the area of conversation analysis is relevant to my research as a primary use of
email is as a communication medium [Whittaker and Sidner, 1996; Ducheneaut and Watts,
2005]. That is, email is often used to have a conversation of sorts, similar to a conversation
on the phone where conversation analysis techniques have been applied [Schegloﬀ, 1968].
Conversations through email exhibit several of the non-basic settings outlined by [Clark,
1996, p. 11], e.g. they lack copresence, visibility, audibility, instantaneity, evanescence,
and recordlessness. Of course, while it is true in a basic fashion that email can be quite
conversation-like, proceeding mail-to-mail in a chatty, rapid fashion, it is important to note
thatnotallemailinteractionsormessageshavethistypeofform. Thereareanumberofways
in which email, or particular emails, diﬀer quite markedly from conversations (e.g. text can
be formal and formally arranged, exchange of messages does not occur, turns are positioned
far apart temporally), or conversation turns (e.g. some emails are more like letters, broadcast
messages, adverts or information brieﬁngs). This said, emails often form into sequences of
interaction, and these sequences of interaction are opened up, organized and closed in a
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 2. Literature Review 27
way that it is relevant and useful to look at how ﬁndings from studies of conversation may
be applied to email in order to gain analytic traction on what is going on and why. This
dissertation uses conversation analysis [Sacks et al., 1992] for this purpose and, therefore
attempts to show its usefulness for this purpose rather in the way that a similar approach
of successfully applying CA was taken to text-chat [O’Neill and Martin, 2003].
Diﬀerences withstanding, there are a number of purposes that conversations on email serve,
which are common to conversations independent of the medium or setting (e.g. face-to-face,
telephone, or text-chat). One example is Goﬀman [1967], and his deﬁnition of the job of
‘face-work’ (i.e. the work to present oneself in a particular manner), which is currently being
done over email as well. The idea of ‘face-work’ is important in conversation analysis, and
my work, as this is an activity that drives many aspects around conversation, as it is a
primary method that individuals use to construct their presentation to others.
Another concept that is used to uncover special events and breakdowns within conversations
is that of the ‘perceived normal’ developed by Garﬁnkel [1963]. That is, one can assume
that an event in everyday life is exceptional or normal through the treatment of said event
by the participants and their opinions about what is expected.
CA was developed primarily by Sacks et al. [1992] along with several colleagues in the
60’s and 70’s, however this work was not published until 1992. Sacks worked primarily
from detailed transcriptions of phone calls, and his investigations initially centered around
the conversations that occurred on a mental health hotline. During his analysis of phone
calls he developed a method for analyzing conversations. Simply put, his method was to
uncover and delineate the ways in which the participants in a conversation could be shown
to organise their conversations. For example, how did they manage turns of talk? And, how
were questions, demands, inquiries, orders and so forth produced, recognized, and oriented
to by the collocutors? Sacks was interested in the participants’ practices, methods and
understandings exhibited in unfolding sequences of talk and its local management, rather
than in using externally generated theory as a means of categorising and explaining talk. In
this way he hoped to get up-close to the real phenomenon.
Sacks’ method, CA, was a close relative of ethnomethodology (EM) [Garﬁnkel, 1967] essen-
tially applying the EM analytic orientation (to uncover the methods, practices and reasoning
of those being studied, through using naturalistic methods of study) to the specialised do-
main of conversation, presented in transcript form. Through his studies and analysis he
showed how units of conversation were deﬁned and recognised by the participants [Sacks
et al., 1992, p. 4]. He showed that units of conversation occurred in pairs and that the utter-
ance of the ﬁrst unit provides a slot for the next unit to take place, but does not guarantee
it. More speciﬁcally, the completion of the pair requires the perception and acknowledg-
ment of the ﬁrst unit through the ‘correct,’ preﬁgured response of the interlocutor, e.g. for
a question to gain the status of ‘question’ it needs to be recognized and oriented to as such.
Sacks showed that these units make up the various sequences that provide the architecture
for conversations. These diﬀerent sequences serve various purposes in a conversation, the
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 2. Literature Review 28
particular sequence that I am most interested in for this research are the exchanges that
makeup conversational openings, i.e. how the start of conversations are negotiated and set
up.
While I realize and acknowledge that there are other frameworks that can be used to analyze
conversations [Clark, 1996; Levinson, 1983; Shiﬀrin, 1987; Winograd, 1983], I focus primarily
on conversational openings as I feel this is the most applicable and explanatory for the
phenomenon that I investigated. In essence, the activities around email notiﬁcations and
attendingtoemail,wherethereisashiftfrom‘doing’somethingelseto‘doing’email,whether
this is a reﬂex reaction or a conscious decision.
2.3.1 Opening Sequences
Conversationalopeningsweredescribedinpartby[Sacksetal.,1992, p.72]inhisdescription
of accountable actions (the grounds for why we are talking, why someone was called, and
why it is appropriate), which are used by a summoner to explain how they came to make
the call or why they initiated the conversation. Schegloﬀ [1968, 1979, 2004], carried on
the investigation of conversational openings throughout his career, of particular note is the
paper ‘Sequencing in Conversational Openings’ [Schegloﬀ, 1968]. Much like Sacks, in his
investigations Schegloﬀ focused primarily on transcriptions of conversations over the phone.
Several key ideas came out of Schegloﬀ’s investigation around the particularities involved in
answering the phone. He developed the distribution rule to explain how turns in a conver-
sation function between the two parties on the phone. This rule was used to explain why
the answerer speaks ﬁrst [Schegloﬀ, 1968, p. 1076], even though the answerer does not know
who the caller is.
Another important contribution of Schegloﬀ’s work is the summons-answer sequence. Sche-
gloﬀ described a summons as an ‘attention getting device’ [Schegloﬀ, 1968, p. 1080]. For
example, in phone conversations the ringing of the telephone is the summons to the con-
versation, whereas, in face-to-face conversations there is a larger amount of variation (e.g.
“Hey, John” or whistling to get someone’s attention) [Schegloﬀ, 2004]. An important aspect
of a summons, particularly a ringing phone, is how we are beckoned to answer it as it has a
compelling nature.
The summons-answer sequence when treated together has a more complex relationship with
the conversation and is accompanied by several obligations both within the exchange and
upon its successful completion. While simply initiating a summons does not necessarily
obligate the potential answerer to answer the summons (at which point the potential conver-
sation would not occur), if they do answer the summons it becomes a non-terminal sequence
after which the summoner is obligated to speak. The summoner can choose one of several
follow-ups at this point, such as an accountable action (e.g. why I got your attention) or
the work of identifying parties. In this way summons-answer sequences are non-terminal,
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 2. Literature Review 29
while a summons can be merely an ‘attention getting mechanism’ [Schegloﬀ, 1968, p. 1080],
a summons-answer sequence is ‘speciﬁcally preliminary to something that follows’ [Schegloﬀ,
1968, p. 1080].
Iwanttomakeacleardistinctionbetweenanaspectofasummons versusasummons-answer
sequence, in that a summons is not necessarily non-terminal. More speciﬁcally, whether or
not the ringing phone is answered it still retains its identity as a summons. That said, while
a summons is an ‘attention getting device’ it is a speciﬁc kind that is intended to begin a
conversation, whether it is answered or not. This is particularly important to make clear
in regards to my later analysis of email as a conversation medium, as it has several unique
features where this and other distinctions around ‘attention getting device[s]’ necessitate
precision in their usage to get a clear view of how they map onto email, particularly in that
emails often do not require an immediate response.
Another interesting aspect, particularly in comparison with email, is Schegloﬀ’s interest in
the physical barrier between the summoner and answerer, which makes it more diﬃcult to
communicate what type of response a summons has garnered. This sometimes has the result
of, for example, the continued knocking at the door or repeated phoning of someone, this is
perceived as over-insistence and considered impolite [Schegloﬀ, 1968]. There are also things
that can be inferred from unanswered summons, particularly with phone summons like ‘they
weren’t home.’ These inferences are important in my analysis of email, where there is a
potentially greater level of ambiguity.
2.3.2 Contrasting Phone and Face-to-Face
A device that Schegloﬀ used to illuminate the particularities of summons-answer sequences is
tocontrastinstantiationsofthemacrossmediums[Schegloﬀ,2004]. Hiscomparisonsbetween
phone and face-to-face are relevant in that I am extending this comparison to email. This
particular comparison helps to explain why certain aspects of each medium are unique and
at times problematic or advantageous.
The ﬁrst part of the summons-answer sequence is the issuing of the summons, when Schegloﬀ
compared how this works between face-to-face and on the phone he uncovered several diﬀer-
ences. One relevant aspect to my work is how the interruption of the summons is mediated
and by whom. In a face-to-face setting, much of the negotiation of when to interrupt the
answerer is navigated by the summoner. In this case the summoner has many visual indica-
tors as to whether the person is engaged in a conversation or activity, it is simply considered
rude to interrupt someone mid-conversation. Therefore, they are responsible for looking at
the circumstances and determining an appropriate moment for the interruption. When we
contrast this to how the interruption of a summons is negotiated on the phone, much more
of the responsibility is shifted to the answerer. This is due in large part to the physical
barrier between the parties, as such the summoner has little responsibility in determining an
appropriate moment for the interruption, other than issuing the summons at a ‘reasonable’
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 2. Literature Review 30
hour.
Another aspect that is interesting, especially in the analysis of email, is the amount of
information that is available to both the summoner and the answerer. On the phone, at least
whenSchegloﬀdidhisinitialwork,theringofaphonewasjustthat,andtheonlyinformation
thatwasavailablewasspeculative. Thelackofinformationcreatesaninformationimbalance,
wherethesummonerknowssigniﬁcantlymorethantheanswereraboutthepartiesandtopics
to be involved in the conversation (i.e. the purpose). This is quite diﬀerent from a face-
to-face summons where the amount of information is far more balanced, there is no visual
barrier and the answerer can clearly see the summoner.
Arelatedfeatureofthesetwomediumsistheamountofinformationthatispackagedwiththe
summons itself. On the phone the granularity, or isolation of the summons is relatively stark.
The phone rings, it contains virtually no additional information than simply to summon the
person to a conversation. However, in face-to-face settings far more information can be
packaged or accompanied with a summons, the most obvious being who it is (although this
is not true on modern mobile phones). The summons could be packed into a request, e.g.
‘John, could you do this for me’, where the summons is a term of address within the request.
This term of address also allows for targeted summonses, where on the phone this targeting
was more or less targeted at a location instead of at a speciﬁc person. As a result in phone
summons-answer sequences there is quite a lot of work that goes into the identiﬁcation of the
parties, sometimes it is done solely by voice recognition and is an act of intimacy [Schegloﬀ,
1979].
This analysis of what is unique to the phone and face-to-face summonses is useful. Of course,
the concept of the summons required a bit of reconﬁguration when moving from face-to-face
tothephone, andIrequireadegreemoreinextendingittoemailcommunication. Schegloﬀ’s
work serves as a framework with which we can analyse email through contrasting similar
phenomenon with other conversation media. This work still holds mostly true now with
the advent of caller id and mobile telephony, however, the imbalance of information in
the knowledge of the identity of the caller is a bit more redressed and this has impacted
practices yet again. The impact of this change in technology has of course been investigated
by a number of researchers that I now review.
2.3.3 Impact of Mobile Phones
Two clear changes that mobile telephony have brought with it are near ubiquitous caller-
identiﬁcation and the ability to answer the phone anywhere. These phenomena have both
been studied, and both generally result in more personalized exchanges.
Weilenmann [2003], in the aptly named ‘I can’t talk now, I am in a ﬁtting room,’ investigates
how the answerer of a mobile phone summons contextualizes and negotiates their availability
in order to have a conversation. Often the exchange begins with the summoner posing the
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 2. Literature Review 31
question ‘what are you doing?’ which acts as the prompt where the answerer can explain
their availability. Often, this is done through contextualizing their availability with their
location and current activity. This helps to give the summoner information to negotiate
(with the answerer) the interruptibility of the answerer.
Moreover,sincetheimbalanceofinformationismuchlesswithcallerid,theanswersarebeing
tailored, as the summoner is generally known to the answerer and the answerer can assume
that they are the ones being summoned [Arminen and Leinonen, 2006]. Interestingly, once
the information deﬁcit begins to close and the answerer knows the identity of the summoner
the sequence of answering the phone begins to change. Instead of the opening sequence
that establishes identity, the answerer does a tailored answer to begin the conversation to
acknowledge that the identiﬁcation sequence is unneeded. However, further validation of
Schegloﬀ’s work is clearly seen when the summoner is not identiﬁed by the caller id, and the
behaviour previously attributed with answering a land line phone is reverted to.
In the comparisons between face-to-face, land-line, and mobile phone openings one can see
how the technologies impact how people perform these openings and begin a conversation,
as well as how they in turn provide and conceal information. In this work, I further this
comparison with the diﬀerences between these and email. Email, as it is a diﬀerent commu-
nicationmediumwith additionalaﬀordancesand missingotheraﬀordances(like synchronous
exchange) necessitates additional analysis to describe how it functions.
2.3.4 Conversation as Collaboration
In the book Using Language, Clark [1996] argues that people use language for collaboration,
and that conversations are an integral piece to this collaboration. Clark [1996] provides an
even more speciﬁc term for conversations in this context, calling them joint actions (p. 82).
An example that Clark gives to make the distinction of an action versus a joint action is
playing the piano alone versus playing a duet with another person.
Further evidence that something at least akin to conversations are occuring over email is the
presence of similar collaborations occuring over email, in fact many of the threads are quite
goal oriented in nature [Whittaker et al., 2007]. For this reason, it is useful and relevant to
review the qualities and manners in which conversations are collaborative and these joint
actions are accomplished. The framework that Clark and his collaborators outline, helps
to determine when an email transitions into a conversation and in what ways conversations
over email deviate from the ‘basic setting’ [Clark, 1996, p. 8].
Clark and Brennan [1991] deﬁne the ‘basic setting’ of conversations as being face-to-face,
after which they go on to deﬁne the features of face-to-face conversations that shape the
basic setting for conversations. As a conversation medium deviates from this set of features,
it becomes increasingly nonbasic and may require ‘special techniques and practices’ [Clark,
1996, p. 11] and lack the richness of the face-to-face medium. Listed below are the features
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 2. Literature Review 32
as deﬁned by [Clark and Brennan, 1991, p. 9–10].
1. Copresence — The participants share the same physical environment
2. Visibility — The participants can see each other.
3. Audibility — The participants can hear each other.
4. Instantaneity — The participants perceive each other’s actions at no perceptible delay.
5. Evanescence — The medium is evanescent — it fades quickly.
6. Recordlessness — The participants’ actions leave no record or artifact.
7. Simultaneity — The participants can produce and receive at once and simultaneously.
8. Extemporaneity — The participants formulate and execute their actions extempora-
neously, in real time.
9. Self-determination — The participants determine for themselves what actions to take
when.
10. Self-expression — The participants take actions as themselves.
Beyond these features that help to deﬁne conversation settings in relation to face-to-face,
Clark and Schaefer [1989] expanded the basic units of conversation beyond just relaying
content and proposed that they had the dual purpose of content and grounding. Where
grounding is establishing a thing “as part of common ground well enough for current pur-
poses” [Clark, 1996, p. 221]. A main point around the collaboration in conversations is
in establishing this common ground. Clark performed quite a lot of work in analyzing the
mannerinwhichcommongroundwasestablished, brokedown, andhowitwasreconstructed.
OtherworkdonebyClarkwerethestatesofunderstanding[ClarkandSchaefer,1989, p.267-
268]. These are particularly relevant to studying conversations over email, as the states of
understanding often seem more fragile. Ballas et al. [1992] further leveraged these states of
understanding in order to explicate the semantic distance between the intentions of the user
and the expressions available on the interface.
• State 0: B didn’t notice that A uttered anything
• State 1: B noticed that A uttered something (but B is not in State 2)
• State 2: B correctly heard content (but wasn’t in State 3)
• State 3: B understood what A meant with the content presentation
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 2. Literature Review 33
In terms of how the actions are actually accomplished [Clark, 1996] action ladder (p. 153),
helps to describe how actions are carried out in conversation.
• Level 4: Proposal and consideration
• Level 3: Signaling and recognition, or meaning and understanding
• Level 2: Presentation and identiﬁcation
• Level 1: Execution and attention
All of these topics relate strongly to email conversations and give insight into what makes it
more diﬃcult to collaborate when stretched over the course of time and space.
2.4 Uses and Gratiﬁcation Theory
The roots of Uses and Gratiﬁcations Theory can be traced back to the work of Herzog [1940,
1944], where she analyzed gratiﬁcations that consumers of radio expected to gain. Herzog
[1944] interviewed housewives and identiﬁed three gratiﬁcations that they expected to gain
fromtheirlisteningtoradiosoapoperas(learning, emotion, andwishfulthinking). Anearlier
analysis Herzog [1940] performed a similar analysis where she identiﬁed additional gratiﬁ-
cations for another radio program (competition, education, self-evaluation, and sporting).
Later McQuail et al. [1972] extended this theory in analyzing voter needs in regard to mass
media, speciﬁcally investigating the eﬀects of television and newspapers on British elections.
ThisearlybodyofworkestablishedabasicpremiseofUsesandGratiﬁcationsTheory,mainly
that gratiﬁcations sought and obtained from the use of a medium helps to explain the usage
of that medium (often in terms of amount of usage) [LaRose and Eastin, 2004]. The theory
was later extended to take into account the set of expected gratiﬁcations that a user has for
the usage of a medium, a slight deviation from the more strict set of gratiﬁcations sought /
gratiﬁcations obtained model held previously [Palmgreen and II, 1979; LaRose and Eastin,
2004].
An additional extension in Uses and Gratiﬁcation theory was in moving from using a single
explanatory variable for a single session of consumption, to using a set of expected gratiﬁ-
cations as explanatory for multiple sessions [Rubin, 1983]. This acknowledges the concept
that a single session of use is able to fulﬁll various, multiple expected gratiﬁcations. The
work that [Rubin, 1983] conducted in developing this method was in the context of television
viewing.
In a move to help give more grounding and insight into how the gratiﬁcations and poten-
tial gratiﬁcations are conceived for the survey, LaRose and Eastin [2004] drew from Social
Cognitive Theory [Bandura, 2001, 1989].
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 2. Literature Review 34
Uses and Gratiﬁcations theory and method have also been applied to several internet tech-
nologies. Papacharissi and Rubin [2000] applied the theory broadly to internet use, where
the authors were investigating whether they could predict internet use through gratiﬁcations
sought. They identiﬁed ﬁve gratiﬁcations in their work: Interpersonal Utility; Pass Time;
Information Seeking; Convenience; and Entertainment. The authors were also interested in
how long, in terms of years adopted, a given user had been using the internet.
Flanagin and Metzger [2001] conducted an additional study of internet use where they lever-
aged a Uses and Gratiﬁcation approach. They were interested in how, if at all, use of the new
media of the internet was changing gratiﬁcations. The authors collected their data in 1997
and 1998 from 684 individuals and treated internet use as a multidimensional technology. A
primaryinterest, andquiterelevanttothisdissertation, washowtheinternetwasfunctioning
as a conversation medium. They found that users utilized email to get information, provide
others with something, and to stay in touch. Upon constructing clusters from the survey
responses that they gathered they found that email was similarly attributed to face-to-face
and phone use for social gratiﬁcations. Meaning, by the late 90’s email was being considered
a relatively standard communication medium.
More recently Uses and Gratiﬁcation Theory has been applied to chat [Leung, 2001], social
networking sites [Langstedt, 2013], and Twitter [Chen, 2011].

System and Method
In order to isolate various stages of the process of attending to email and getting lost, I
conducted a series of studies that pinpointed diﬀerent parts of the process. For my ﬁrst
study, I performed an exploratory experiment in the laboratory to determine how partic-
ipants assessed the importance of individual emails (N=10), the details of which are in
Section 3.1. The next investigation I undertook involved three diﬀerent studies, which I
detail individually:
1. a survey on email usage (N=54), Section 3.2;
2. a two-week study of email usage (N=20), Section 3.3;
3. and ﬁnally, the application of Attentional Network Test (N=9), Section 3.3
Myﬁnalstudywastovalidatemyﬁndingsaroundthereasonsforattendingtoemail, thiswas
done through deploying a survey that followed the Uses and Gratiﬁcation Theory tradition
(N=52), the details of which are in Section 3.5
Some of these studies built on each other and involved a common subset of participants, the
sourcesthateachstudydrewitsparticipantsfromisoutlinedinFigure3.1. Newparticipants
were recruited during Studies 1, 2 and 5. The population from the laboratory study in Study
1 is a completely separate set of participants than the rest of the studies. The remainder of
the studies had a common subset of participants that took part in all of the studies. Where
Study 4 was a subset of Study 3, which was a subset of Study 2. In the ﬁnal study, a further
subset of Study 4 participated as well as sending the call for participation more widely. The
results for these studies are used in various parts of my analysis, each chapter details which
studies it draws its results from and what data it uses.
All of the studies were approved by the IRB. Study 1 was approved under IRB 09–907 and
Studies 2–5 were approved under IRB 12–664. Consult Appendix A.1) for the respective
approval letters.

pool. While studies 3 and 4 drew solely on the existing pool. Study 5 drew on both sources.
Throughout these studies I attempt to not only divide email use into a series of events,
roughly mapping to chronological usage, but also model the attributes of an email user into
three groups: precondition, which is the representations of the email corpus when they enter
into an email session (e.g. number of unread emails, number of emails sent only to the user,
etc.); predisposition, which is the set of attributes that indicate whether or not a particular
user is more susceptible to being distracted or becoming lost; and mitigating behaviors, such
as practicing Inbox Zero, or reading every incoming message.
3.1 Study 1: Lab Experiment
To determine how participants were making decisions about the importance of an individual
emails in terms of a Likert scale rating. I conducted a lab experiment where the primary
measure of diﬃculty was the amount of time it took to make the determination. To isolate
each individual decision on the messages, participants were presented with a single message
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 3. System and Method 37
at a time. While this admittedly deviates somewhat from real-world usage, this study
is speciﬁcally aimed at investigating the relative eﬀort involved in making decisions for
individual messages and not examining overall email triage strategies. In order to determine
the relative importance of the components of an email message (subject, sender, body, etc.)
I administered a post-experimental questionnaire as well as using an eye tracker to record
the amount of visual attention spent on each component.
Ten participants were recruited through a call for participation on a graduate mailing list
and no hypotheses were made based on age, profession, or gender. Three of the participants
were female and seven were male, eight of the participants were graduate students primarily
from Computer Science.
3.1.1 Task Design
The participants made determinations about email relevance for ﬁfteen emails. This task
involved inspecting the information contained in each email, verbally indicating that they
were ﬁnished, and then rating the relevance while referring to a sheet containing the rating
scale.
The equipment used in this study included an Apple computer running the Snow Leopard
operating system, an Apple Cinema Display measuring thirty-inches, and an ASL MobileEye
eye tracking system. All participants completed the set of tasks in the using the same display
and the same eye tracking system. The large display was important for deﬁning large hit
areas for the eye tracking system. In order to put boundaries on the time spent on each task
the eye tracker was used to establish when the email was ﬁrst engaged with and the verbal
indication that they were complete was used as the end of the time needed.
The aspects that were measured during each task involved the relevance of the email and the
amount of time the rating took. The relevance of each email was gathered throughout the
experiment. Participants rated each email’s relevance on a ﬁve point Likert scale, ranging
from 1 = Unimportant to 5 = Very Important. This variable was used to analyze the
correlation between diﬀerent variables and the overall relevance of an email.
The second measure was decision time, this was the amount of time between initial engage-
ment with the email and the verbal conclusion of the decision. This time was measured by
inspecting the time stamps of the diﬀerent events on the video footage on post experiment
analysis. This variable was used to determine the diﬃculty in situating the email and mak-
ing a determination of relevance. Decision time was taken as a proxy for diﬃculty, that is,
I assumed that a longer decision time was the result of a more diﬃcult determination of
relevance.
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 3. System and Method 38
3.1.2 Post Questionnaire Design
A questionnaire was administered to each participant after the experiment. The purpose
of the questionnaire was mainly around gathering information about their relationship with
each sender and the level of relevance for each of the topics referenced in the emails.
The ﬁrst question for a given email was the the importance of the sender, this was measured
usingaﬁvepointLikertscale. ThisscaleincludedthevaluesUnimportant toVery Important.
This variable was used to determine the social proximity of the sender.
The second question in regards to the sender was the amount of contact the participant had
with them, this was rated on a ﬁve point Likert-type scale as well. The scale included the
values Never to At least once a day. Where contact was deﬁned as any interaction both
within email and outside of email.
The ﬁnal question for each email was the relevance of topic, which was rated on a ﬁve point
Likert scale. This scale included the values Unimportant to Very Important. This variable
was used to determine the relevance of the topic and was primarily used in comparison with
the eﬀect of social proximity.
3.1.3 Procedure
Each participant ﬁrst sent information over email to make determinations about various
senders in their social circles and topics that they are interested in. While only subjects and
topics of emails were required, participants found it easier to simply forward the requisite
messages to the administrator of the experiment. This data was used to setup the exper-
iment. Once the experiment was prepared, the participant was introduced to the study,
calibrated with the eye tracking system, then performed the tasks, and administered the
post questionnaire.
3.2 Study 2: Survey on Email Usage
The ﬁrst stage in the main investigation of this dissertation was to deploy a survey to probe
existing strategies, practices, and the circumstances of each participant. The survey focused
onhowparticipantsarecurrentlyusingemail, withwhatfrequencytheyarebeingdistracted,

quite diﬃcult to determine from usage logs. Therefore, the data from this survey was utilized

3.3 Study 3: Email Usage, Diary, and Interview
To my knowledge, isolating and studying the natural occurrence of an email session and
relating a diary study to the speciﬁc instances of email activity, especially across devices,
has not yet been done. In order to establish the relation between the diary and a session I
utilized a mixed method approach in which I directly logged email events and gathered diary
entries. As such, the system that I built for this study is comprised of two parts: the email
logger that recorded any changes to the email corpus; and the front-end that participants
used to enroll for the study and complete diary entries.
My email logger used IMAP to log session details such as length, preconditions of the email
corpus, and activities that the participant performed during the session. Similar activity
logs have been used to study interactions with computers before [Iqbal and Horvitz, 2007].
More speciﬁcally, usage logs have been used to study diﬀerent phenomena in email, for
example, the utility of ﬁling [Whittaker et al., 2011], the distribution of information [Fisher
and Dourish, 2004], and response rhythms [Tyler and Tang, 2003].
I implemented a front-end using Django1 that participants would use to ﬁll out speciﬁc diary
entries associated with a particular session. Diary prompts were sent to users based on their
activity as measured by the email logger. More detail about the email logger and when and
why I dispatched diary prompts can be found below in their respective sections.
I recruited 20 participants from our university; 12 were female and 4 were male (4 didn’t
report). My participants ranged from the ages of 23-37, with x¯ = 25.6 and σ = 4.6. Within
my participant group 11 were graduate students, 1 was an undergraduate student, 1 was a
stay at home dad, 5 were working professionals, and 2 did not report. Participants engaged

That said, participants could use whichever Gmail account they preferred. This study was
approved by the universtity IRB (#12-664) and, as I am dealing with participants’ personal
information, whenever there was a choice between respecting my participants’ privacy or
making my data richer, I opted for privacy protection and used the absolute minimum

amount of information that I would need to answer my research questions. For enrolling in
the study, participants received a ﬁve dollar gift card, and if they ﬁlled out over half of their
diary prompts, they received an additional ﬁve dollar gift card. For any statistical analysis
I used the R statistical package, version 3.0.
3.3.1 Procedure
To initiate the logging of their email, participants ﬁrst enrolled in the study using my web
application. After the participants created an account on the system, they then granted the
application the proper privileges that are required to access their email. Since I made use of
Gmail I was able to use OAuth3 so that I did not have to collect or store the participants’
passwords. OAuth provided an additional beneﬁt to the participants, in that they were able
to shut down access to their email at any time during the study without having to ask me.
The web application also provided participants with the ability to delete any sensitive/overly
private emails from the system; however, none of the participants used this feature.
Once the participants were properly enrolled in the service the study began in earnest. The
primary driver for this study was the IMAP logger, in that it gathered quantitative data that
was used both in the analysis and to dispatch diary prompts. The IMAP logger connected
to the Gmail IMAP server every three minutes to take a snapshot of the state of the email
corpus and determine if this state diﬀered in anyway from the last snapshot.
I was able to take a snapshot of each participant’s entire email corpus every three minutes
because I did a bulk request on a subset of headers from the IMAP server. This bulk
request was done for each email folder (or tag in Gmail), this request contained the header
information (or metadata) for all of the emails in that folder. The header data for an email
is comprised of items like the address it was sent to, if it had attachments, if it has been read
or not, along with timestamps for when it was sent. I also ignored any activity in folders
that were labeled as Junk or Spam, to ensure that I were looking at the already ﬁltered email
that the participants were receiving. I determined, empirically, that three minutes was the
minimum amount of time necessary to complete the snapshot in my pilot.
Throughout the study I did not collect the body of any emails and anonymized each email
address using the md5 hash function before it was stored in the database. By using this
hash function I could tell that a participant had sent or received n number of emails to or
from a certain address, I just did not know what the actual address was. For example, if the
user received ten emails from author@inst.tld, I would see that they had received ten emails
from 25446962, the ﬁrst eight characters of the md5 hash. At the end of the study I deleted
all of the OAuth tokens granted to my application and sent an email to all participants with
instructions on how to revoke the application’s privileges.
Since I had snapshots of the entire email corpus every three minutes, I was able to keep track

of many aspects of the participants’ email activity. I group them into three main categories:
• Running Totals: I kept track of several running totals that informed the preconditions
for each session. I tracked the their total number of messages, unread messages, new
messages since the last session, messages in the inbox, unread messages in the inbox,
new messages in the inbox since last active, and number of composed / replied to
messages.
• Activity Counts: For each session I tracked what messages they had read, deleted,
composed, and replied to.
• Interactions: Ialsokepttrack oftowhom(anonymized)they were sending/reading/re-
plying.
How I determined whether a participant was in the active state, and how long they were in
that state, requires further explanation. I deﬁne the active state as one where the participant
isdoingsomesortofactionwithinemail,e.g.reading,moving,orcomposingamessage. First,
todetermineifaparticipantwasactive, Icomparedsnapshotsgatheredfrommyemaillogger
to detect when the participant modiﬁed any aspects of their email corpus. So, if they had
moved an email, read an email, composed an email, etc. I ﬂagged them as being active in
that three minute slice of time. Second, to determine an active email session’s length, I
summed these active slices of time. However, if there were a three minute inactive slice that
was straddled by two active slices, then I considered that to be a contiguous block of activity.
An inactive slice is one where no activity was detected, i.e. the participant did not move,
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 3. System and Method 42
read, or compose any messages. A few diﬀerent possibilities are illustrated in Figure 3.2. In
Figure 3.2a, two active events occurred in a relatively short time span, however, this gets
categorized as a six minute session. Contrast this with Figure 3.2b, where two active events
occur in a longer time span, however, this is also categorized as a six minute session. To
illustrate some of the smoothing I did see Figure 3.2c, where two events occurred in two time
slices that straddled an inactive slice of time, in this case I count this as one session and
it is categorized as a nine minute session. A participant was deemed inactive if there was
more than three inactive time slices. The rationale behind this policy is that the changes
detected by the changes in IMAP were not continuous and only signals of use. Therefore, if
a participant read an email for six minutes and then read another email it should be counted
as the same session even if there is a three minute slice of time where they are not ﬂagged
as active. While this method is not perfect, I feel it is a suﬃcient approach to capture most
discrete active session.
3.3.2 Collecting Diary Entries
When the email logger detected that a period of activity had ended, then it triggered a
request, in the form of a URL, to the user to ﬁll out a diary entry through SMS. This
happened at most twice a day and only during ‘typical work hours’ of the participant’s
timezone with a minimum of four hours between prompts. The diary entries were a web-
based form where the participant ﬁlled out the following information: the motivation for
initiating the email session, which task (if any) was interrupted by the email session, if they
were distracted during the email session, and information about what constituted the email
session. I opted to keep the number of text ﬁelds low, in order to decrease the amount of
work for the participants. Keeping the amount of time required to ﬁll out an individual
diary relatively low was also important for us to capture the particular moment in time, I
wanted to avoid the ‘Heisenberg’ problem Czerwinski et al. [2004].
I categorized the reported motivations for attending to email in an iterative manner where I
used the words of the participant to label each entry. Once this initial set of labels was deter-
mined, I grouped entries with essentially the same motivation and used the most descriptive
term. After several iterations of this process I maintained the terms of the participants and
arrived at a unique set of categories. The ﬁnal categories appear below:
• Anxiety - participants cited that they had not checked their email in a long time and
were concerned if they had received something unexpected.
• Compose a Message - participants cited that they needed to send a message.
• Curiosity - participants cited that they were curious if they had received anything
interesting.
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 3. System and Method 43
• Down Time - when participants did not have anything in particular to do and decided
to check their email.
• Expecting Communication -whenparticipantswereanticipatingthearrivalofaspeciﬁc
message from someone (e.g. an advisor or boss).
• Inbox - sometimes participants initiated a session because their inbox caught their
attention.
• Notiﬁcation - participants cited their phone buzzing or receiving a desktop notiﬁcation.
• Previous Awareness - participants cited that someone mentioned an important email
in conversation or they saw an email in a previous session.
• Reﬁnding - participants sometimes went into email to ﬁnd something speciﬁc, like a
meeting location or a work item.
• Routine - many participants checked email ﬁrst thing in the morning, right after lunch,
or when they ﬁrst arrived to work.
• Unread Count - participants sometimes noticed they had a few unread emails and
decided to read them.
• Not Reported - participants sometimes put ‘Nothing’ for motivation or left it blank.
3.3.3 Limitations and Advantages of Email Logging and Diary En-
try
My method has two limitations: ﬁrst, it only captures actions that change IMAP status,
therefore rereading of email is not captured; and second, rules used to automatically ﬁle
incoming messages can cause false positives. The ﬁrst limitation is unavoidable as re-opening
an email does not change any of the ﬂags or information in IMAP. However, if they did
anything within the same three minute snapshot other than reread email, then the eﬀect was
mitigated as the session was still counted as active. So the limitation is in under-counting
sessions that consist exclusively of just rereading an old email.
Thesecondlimitation, thatrulescancausefalsepositivesforactivestatus, wasmorecomplex
to avoid. As I was aware of this limitation throughout my study and pilot, I developed
heuristics based around the amount of time between when a message was received and when
it was ﬁled (or tagged) into a diﬀerent folder. During the pilot I paid careful attention to
the number of false positives and found that the above method was suﬃcient in reducing
this number.
While these two limitations cannot be discounted, the advantages to my method are numer-
ous. From the perspective of the participant, the advantages are as follows. Participants
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 3. System and Method 44
are not limited to a particular client or platform, they just need to use Gmail. Due to this
advantage, I was able to capture activity across all of the devices that each participant uses.
The impact on the user is not heavy, there are no plugins to install and they need to only
answer a short diary entry twice a day on weekdays.
In terms of the data gathered, the advantages are as follows. Through the combination of
OAuth and limiting the data that I request and store I am able to maintain the privacy of
the participants, while still being able to gather detailed data about them over a period of
time (a challenge endemic to studies of Personal Information Management practices). The
logs of user activity help to determine bounds around the diﬀerent email sessions and provide
further quantitative insights into the diﬀerent email activities, minimizing what they had to
enter in the diary. I was able to determine the entire writing process of emails since drafts
are often stored in IMAP folders, and their statuses updated as they are being written. The
way in which I was able to do this longer study, grabbing email data as it unfolded instead
of just a full, one-time snapshot aﬀorded greater insight into the participants’ activities than
many previous email studies.
3.4 Study 4: Attentional Network Test
To gather Attention Network Test (ANT) scores I recruited participants that had completed
the previous phases and utilized the test developed by Fan et al. [2002]. ANT uses several
diﬀerent mechanisms (cues, congruency, and time) to determine diﬀerent attentional traits of
the participant. The test consists of a two ten minute sessions during which the participant
is asked to make determinations about whether an arrow is pointing to the left or right. The
program that was used to conduct the ANT by the researchers has been made available and
there is a Java version that can be run either on an individual desktop or on a remote server.
Upon the completion of the ANT a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet is compiled with the results
of the test, these are stored on the server and coded to the participant number. Participants
will be asked to take the test during a quiet time in the day and asked to email the resulting
spreadsheet.
ANT is designed to test the three diﬀerent attentional networks during a single task. The
three networks are alerting, orienting, and executive control. The authors deﬁne alerting as
“achieving and maintaining an alert state”; orienting as “the selection of information from
sensory input”; and executive control as “resolving conﬂict among responses.” These three
diﬀerent networks will be correlated separately with the frequency of getting lost in email.
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 3. System and Method 45
3.5 Study 5: Uses and Gratiﬁcation Survey
Uses and gratiﬁcations aims to ﬁnd out what gratiﬁcations that users are expecting to gain
from a media’s use. These are grounded in diﬀerent ways and there is not a standard method
for determining the gratiﬁcations that users seek from the use of a type of media. I have
primarily grounded the gratiﬁcations sought in the diary responses that I gathered during
the email logging phase of my experiment. While other studies have studied email use among
other media [Papacharissi and Rubin, 2000; Flanagin and Metzger, 2001], grounding email
gratiﬁcations in user reported reasons in the diary entries is meant not so much to compare
with other types of media but to determine the breadth of diﬀerent motivations between
participants in the diary study and with a larger group.
I feel that this grounding is more apt than previous methods. This is because I was able to
draw the questions from the diary responses written by users. I also draw some questions
from previous work in internet use [Papacharissi and Rubin, 2000].
See Appendix B.3 for the full contents of the survey.
3.6 Summary
In this chapter I have outlined the ﬁve studies that I have conducted as part of this research.
Each of these studies isolated various phases and aspects of email usage. In the remainder
of this dissertation these studies will be discussed in the following order.
• Chapter 4 discusses the process of attending to email and draws primarily from Studies
2 (Section 3.2) and 3 (Section 3.3), while drawing from Studies 4 (Section 3.4) and 5
(Section 3.5) as well.
• Chapter5discusseshowparticipantsratedtherelevancyofindividualemailsanddraws

• Chapter 6 discusses how users of email become lost in email and draws primarily from
Study 3 (Section 3.3). While drawing from Studies 2 (Section 3.2) and 4 (Section 3.4)
as well.
Chapter 4
Attending to Email
This chapter presents an analysis of both the quantitative and qualitative data that I col-
lected. The focus of my analysis is on addressing the research questions outlined in Sec-
tion 1.3. This analysis provides insight into the process the participants undertook when
they attended to email.
This chapter consists of several parts. First, addressing the question of what is drawing
users into email. As part of this investigation, I present an examination of how the partici-
pants’ reasons (as reported in their diary entries) relate to conversations that occur on other
mediums, e.g. face-to-face and phone. Second, I present evidence gathered from diary en-
tries indicating that participants maintain a relatively high level of engagement with email.
Thirdly, I leverage usage logs to determine what types of activities the participants engaged
in while attending to email and which activities correlate with longer sessions. Using the
length of sessions and feedback from the diary entries, I present the evidence around the
negative consequences that the participants experienced for attending to email. Finally, I
evidence the participants’ awareness of these issues by presenting the various strategies that
arose from their survey responses, diaries, and interviews.
4.1 Studies Utilized
This chapter draws from the results of:
• Study2–Resultsfromthesurveyareusedtoframetheindividualreasonsforbeginning
a session in the broader context of what participants believe successful email use is and
the strategies they form around to ensure it.
• Study 3 – The diary entries and IMAP logs are used to determine why participants
began their email sessions and what activities lead to longer sessions.

iﬁcations sought from the previous studies, as well as to compare with other traditional
forms of media.

Figure 4.1: Total number of diary entries was 215, each slice of the pie has the number of
occurrences in parenthesis.
My investigation into what draws users into email was primarily accomplished through ex-
amining diary entries. A main ﬁnding of this investigation is that my participants often
decide to attend to email because of a fairly speciﬁc prompt. That is, instead of responding
to a large unread count they instead cite notiﬁcations about an important message, or of-
ten even the expectation of an important message as primary factors in their decision, time
and time again. The diﬀerent reasons cited by users and their frequency are presented in
Figure 4.1.
One unexpected result of this analysis is the relative absence of mentions of the unread
count as a reason to attend to email within the diary entries. In fact, only four diary entries
mentioned this, compared to roughly a third of the diary entries citing notiﬁcations as the
reason for attending to email. This is interesting in that the unread count does not seem to
be utilized by my participants. The apparent lack of utility of the unread count is especially
stark, as email clients typically give only two methods for maintaining awareness of incoming
email: ﬁrst, email clients typically give some sort of aural or visual notiﬁcation for individual
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 4. Attending to Email 48
emails; and second, they often give a rather prominent count of unread emails. I believe
the primary reason that my participants did not seem to make use of the unread count
can be found in the way they did respond to the summons quality of notiﬁcations. Among
my participants, they decided to attend to email based more on individual summonses to
conversations, and not the overall criticality of the amount of emails or general state of their
inbox. Furthermore, the absence of any type of speciﬁc, attention-getting mechanism in
regards to conversation takes the meaning and power out of the unread count as a draw to
a conversation.
In the remainder of this section I provide examples and further analysis of primary reasons
that my participants attended to email. The purpose of this analysis is to examine and
show the overarching reasons that my participants attended to email, I further group the
categories of responses from Figure 4.1 more generally below. In each of the cases I highlight
example diary entries.
4.2.1 Individual Notiﬁcations
Notiﬁcations about individual messages were a strong draw for attending to email. In my
analysis I found that notiﬁcations functioned similarly to the summons in summons-answer
sequences involved in conversational openings. Messages, particularly important messages
that required some sort of response, beckoned the participants to answer them much like
a ringing phone or person requesting their attention. For the diary entries in which this
situation was mentioned (frequency: 63/215, session length(minutes): x¯ = 7.98 σ = 20.08),
the participant usually indicated that the message was from an important collaborator or
signiﬁcant person in their lives, and that this was the reason for attending to email. I must
note, that in my analysis I treated visual and aural notiﬁcations the same, as I did not have
the granularity of data to determine which type of notiﬁcation was encountered. However,

while the details that indicate the relative importance of the email are what prompt action.
Many of these quotes hint at the ongoing relationships that email helps to serve. These

P4: Working on adding to a collaborative paper. New mail notiﬁcation Replied

P9: Heard the notiﬁcation on my phone, saw that it was from my supervisor,
and decided to see if it was important.
P12: I received a new email notiﬁcation. I responded [...].
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 4. Attending to Email 49
Roughly a third of the diary entries mentioned a speciﬁc, individual notiﬁcation. However,
manyofthe diaryentriesalsostipulatethat sincethenotiﬁcationwasfrom someoneorabout
something important to them that is the reason they responded. This evidences that not all
notiﬁcations evoke this behavior, and there are in fact notiﬁcations that, once attended to,
are subsequently ignored. The participants selectively respond to new email notiﬁcations.
4.2.2 Composing Emails
Another relatively common reason for attending email was composing an email for a collab-
oration or coordination (frequency: 21/215, session length (minutes): x¯ = 8.20 σ = 14.42)
Many of these emails were also in reference to individuals that the participants have on
ongoing relationship and possibly a work activity in common with.
P4: Emails out the tantalum collaborative paper for additional comments.
P16: Sent an image to a professor
P3: Wrote an email to a friend and deleted facebook notiﬁcations.
4.2.3 Routine Sessions
A typical behavior among the participants was the strategy of routine sessions (frequency:
65/215, session length (minutes): x¯ = 6.37σ = 6.57). These sessions were often in the
morning as the ﬁrst activity or after returning from a lunch break. During routine sessions
participants often engaged in pruning [Mackay, 1988], this behavior also occurred when
sessions were motivated by downtime or boredom. In this case, pruning typically involved
the participants archiving (when the participants said they were deleting they were almost
always archiving upon inspecting the usage logs) to clean up unimportant emails. Within
these sessions participants also responded to messages that they had left from previous
sessions.
Typically the diary entries for these sessions were short and not terribly detailed, indicative
of the unspeciﬁed nature of these tasks, because the primary goal is to clear out the queue.
P5: check email, delete email
P17: cleared out junk mail. Read important emails.
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 4. Attending to Email 50
Related to routine sessions, but more opportunistic, are sessions that are motivated by down
time (frequency: 16/215, session length(minutes): x¯ = 12.43 σ = 17.65). Where participants
were between tasks, not particularly involved in any task, or even bored. These sessions
functioned much the same as the routine sessions and were used to sift through unimportant
messages and answer any accumulated messages that required a response.
P17: deleted unwanted emails. Read one new message
Ibelievethatthereasonthesesessionsexistisprimarilytwo-fold. First,missinganimportant
email message was clearly an ongoing concern for the participants (as explicated in the
section below). Second, there is a want to ‘keep up’ with emails, it was clear from the survey
responses that the participants heavily connected their eﬃcacy (especially the projection of
it) with email responsiveness. This harkens back to some of the ‘face-work’ that Goﬀman
[1967] said served as a motivator for many conversations.
4.2.4 Attentional Networks
A signiﬁcant hypothesis in this line of research, outlined in Section subsection 1.3.2, was that
there were individual diﬀerences that had a measurable impact on the process of attending
to email. Furthermore, I hypothesized that the Attentional Network scores, as measured by
the Attentional Network Test (ANT), would be a suﬃcient measure to determine an eﬀect.
This set of hypotheses was not conﬁrmed, As seen in Figures, Figure 4.2, Figure 4.3, and
Figure 4.4, there is no clear trend emerging from this data set. The strength of the other
types of signals, primarily the status of the email corpus, is too strong for the more subtle
individual diﬀerences (especially as measured by the ANT) to be clearly identiﬁed.
4.3 Are Participants Maintaining Engagement?
Results for my study evidence a high level of engagement with email among my participants,
as well as the anxiety that can result from it. The most salient and interesting ﬁnding is
that my participants cited that they attended email because they had an expectation that
they had received an important email. The email in question was usually from someone
important to them, e.g. a supervisor or collaborator, and the entries usually implied or
mentioned some ongoing responsibility or important relationship. While these sessions were
not terribly frequent (frequency: 11/215, session length (minutes): x¯ = 12.89 σ = 15.03),
I believe they are indicative of the existence of a consistent, continuous engagement with
email that my participants were maintaining.
Sessions triggered by these feelings where the participants did not receive the expected
message (9) were very short (all but one were three minute sessions). This is presumably

because, while the participant was nervous that they may have missed an important email,
it was simply not there. In fact, none of the sessions of nine minutes or more (39) involved a
session where the participants expected to receive an email from a speciﬁc person and that
expectation was unfulﬁlled.
P13: Damage control: making sure my PI didn’t email
P15: Was looking for a particular email from my professor I work for.
P1: See if I had an email I expected from my sister
This phenomenon also cropped up in a less direct manner when participants cited a worry or
interest about receiving an unspeciﬁed email as the reason for their session. These sessions

were motivated by anxiety or curiosity (frequency: 14/215, session length (minutes): x¯ =
5.78 σ = 6.39), however, they were less speciﬁc about a particular reason that they were
anxious. The primary reasons for these sessions instead seem to be motivated by the loss of
continuous engagement with email.
P15: Checked my email. There were a ton (I had been in a meeting for a while
and couldn’t check my email) so I had a bunch waiting for me. Responses to
some, not all. Didn’t even get around to reading them all.
Sessions that are tangentially related to this category are sessions where the participant was
already aware of an important email message (frequency: 6/215, session length (minutes):

x¯ = 6.50 σ = 6.39). Within these sessions there were instances where the participant had
been told by someone outside of email or had seen the email in a previous session.
P11: My advisor wanted something to be forwarded.
Overall, 31/215 sessions can be directly attributed to reasons associated with anxiety or in-
terest in maintaining an awareness and continuous level of engagement with the participants’
email.

4.4 Which Activities are Participants Undertaking?
In this section I present the activities that the participants performed throughout my study
in their email sessions. Table 4.1 contains a summary of these activities as well as the mean
and standard deviation for the group.
The aspects that are summarized in the table are as follows:
• Sessions: the number of sessions that the participant engaged in, where a session is a
contiguous set of active three minute blocks
• Usage (mins): the number of total minutes that they were active, this is measured in
terms of adding the three minute slices where they were active
• Messages: the number of messages that they received and sent over the course of the
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 4. Attending to Email 55
study regardless of which folder they arrived in or whether they were read or not.
• Inbox: the number of messages that they received in their inbox.
• Read: the number of messages that they read.
• Moved: the number of messages that were either moved or tagged, when a message
received multiple tags this counter increments by one.
• Deleted: the number of messages that were moved to a trash folder or tag.
• Composed: the number of messages written, not including the messages that were
written in reply to another email.
• Replied: the number of messages that were written as replies to another email.
Similar to previous research, I ﬁnd quite a bit of diversity in the number of incoming emails
and the strategies that participants develop to manage them. This is evidenced by each
column having a large variance in relation to the mean.
TheselargevariancesinTable4.1makesomeofthediﬀerentstrategiesevident. Oneexample
where there is a fair amount of variance is in the portion of messages that participants read.
Some participants (1, 9, and 15) read every message that they receive, while others (2, 3,
and 20) nearly read all incoming emails. However, the majority of the participants are only
reading a small portion of their incoming emails.
When these messages are separated into distinct groups, e.g. read vs. unread or ﬁled vs.
unﬁled, I ﬁnd that many messages are never acted upon at all. Speciﬁcally, among the
participants only around half of incoming messages were read, with only a few rigorously
reading incoming mail. Also, I ﬁnd only around 15% of messages that were received were
moved or deleted, meaning 85% of messages were left in the inbox. This suggests that a
large portion of email was not terribly important or pertinent to the participants, keep in
mind that these numbers exclude any messages in Junk or Spam folders.
In summary, the participants read about half of their messages, delete very few of their
messages, and leave the vast majority of them unﬁled in the inbox. This provides insight into
why I did not see many instances of the unread count as a motivating factor in the decision
to attend to email. Mostly because, the majority of behaviors that I see run contrary to
using a raw unread count, if they are only reading half of their email, their unread count
is constantly increasing. Likely, the unread count only really stands out if you read all (or
almost all) of you messages. Secondarily, there is a large amount of variance in the practices
of the participants, illustrating the diﬃculty in developing consistently useful indicators.
These results also further evidence that diﬀerent email messages have vastly diﬀerent levels
of importance to the participants. A subset of incoming messages is read, an even smaller
subsetisactedupon, andanadditionallysmallersubsetisrepliedto. Therefore, manyemails
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 4. Attending to Email 56
do not require a reply, or are at least not taken to require one and therefore are not meant
to start conversations.

Table 4.2: Session length correlates with other user data (spearman correlation coeﬃcients)
I was speciﬁcally interested in answering two questions in regards to session length. First,
does the unread count have any quantitative bearing on how long the participants’ sessions
were? That is, just because they are not citing the unread count as a reason for attending
email, should theybeusingthistomakedecisionstoattendtoemail? Second, whatactivities
are correlates to longer sessions?
To investigate these questions I present the results of the analysis of my logs. I present
the results of a Spearman correlation by giving the correlation coeﬃcients and their level
of signiﬁcance indicated by * for p <= 0.1, ** for p <= 0.05, and *** for p <= 0.001. I
chose to use the Spearman correlation because I did not have a truly continuous measure
of time. The table of these results is found in Table 4.2. This analysis informs the utility
of the unread count and related indicators to estimate the length of the next session. The
measures I chose to include in my analysis are described below, I limited myself to this
group as I was interested in investigating two questions. First, whether or not there are
easily tracked quantitative aspects of email that correlate with session length. In essence, do
my participants have a reliable way to estimate the length (or level of disruption) of their
next session. Second, what activities correlate with session length, to give insight into what
is taking up the majority of time in email use.
The aspects of usage that I report in the table are:
• Messages: Thetotalnumberofmessagesintheirmailcorpusatthestartofthesession.
• Unread: The total number of unread messages in their mail corpus at the start of the
session.
• Inbox: The total number of messages in their inbox at the start of the session.
• Inbox Unread: The total number of unread messages in their inbox at the start of the
session (this is what the unread count is based on).
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 4. Attending to Email 57
• Inbox New: The number of new messages that have arrived in their inbox since the
previous session.
• Read: The number of messages that they read during the session.
• Moved: The number of messages that they moved or tagged during the session.
• Deleted: The number of messages that they deleted during the session.
• Composed: The number of messages that they composed excluding messages that were
in reply to another message during the session.
• Replies: The number of messages that they wrote in reply to another message during
the session.
It is worth noting that none of the above preconditions (e.g. number of unread messages or
messages only to recipient) that I measured had a strong signiﬁcant correlation with session
length. The preconditions that I measured were the set of preconditions that I thought
users of email might reasonably have access to. These results indicate that users do not
have reliable mechanisms to estimate the length of their next session, other than staying
aware and engaged with their email client and incoming messages. I illustrate this through
contrasting the two more salient results of my analysis, the apparent lack of utility of the
unread count versus the strong, signiﬁcant correlation between session length and the read
count.
4.5.1 Unread Count
My analysis points to a particular reason why the unread count was not cited as a reason
for attending to email. This is because the number of unread messages that a participant
has is not an indication of how many important email messages that they had, and certainly
not indicative of how long their next session is likely to be. In my analysis I found that
the number of unread messages in participants’ inboxes did not have a strong, signiﬁcant
correlation with session length.
When I ignore the unread count and instead look only at the Inbox New, which represents
the number of new messages received since the last session, I still only see a signiﬁcant, weak
positive correlation of 0.08. These results suggest that the number of unread messages in
your inbox, or even just the number of new messages, is not an eﬀective means of estimating
the length of the next session.
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 4. Attending to Email 58
4.5.2 Longer Sessions
A clear indicator of the misleading nature of the unread count is the signiﬁcant, strong
correlation between the number of messages that participants read during their session and
the session length (ρ = 0.60,p < 0.001). This correlation is particularly informative because
it is a clear signal from the participants about which messages they thought were important
during their session. Keep in mind that this is only capturing messages that change from
an unread to a read state, which is a subset of the unread messages. We acknowledge that
unread does not mean unlooked at, I just take it to indicate a diﬀerent level of engagement.
Correlates between session length and archiving/deleting messages are quite weak, especially
when compared to the time it takes to read a message. This is understandable, as I found
that many messages are left untouched in the inbox, meaning that participants are not
spending much time ﬁling or deleting and that the bulk of work in email is in simply reading
messages. Other strong correlates with session length were composing and responding to
emails, other indicators for important messages. All of this points to the bulk of work in
email being around reading important emails and participating in conversations.
4.6 Do Users Develop any Strategies?
In my surveys I found evidence that my participants were aware and actively managing
several of the issues that I observed. Of particular note, is the strong link between email and
the projection of eﬃcacy. When my participants were asked what they considered successful
about their email practices, the most common response (27/52) was that they responded
quickly and promptly. One response even mentioned the etiquette around email. As not all
of the respondents of this survey elected to continue as participants after this survey, I have
indicated them with an ‘R’. I continue to indicate the participants in the full study with a
‘P’.
R50: I respond in a timely manner; I know proper e-mail etiquette
R11: quick responses, readily available
R13: I read all email that I receive soon after I see them, and attempt to respond
promptly (within 8 hours).
One participant engineering a method to mitigate the chance of missing an email from
someone important (their advisor).
P7: Emails on phone; emails from academic advisor get ﬁltered into her own
folder.
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 4. Attending to Email 59
Another participant employed a similar method in a more general way, where they elevated
the summons of certain types of messages.
R52: I ﬁlter incoming mail, and if certain keywords are used, or there are certain
authors, I get a text sent to my cell phone. This helps me ﬁlter IMMEDIATELY
important information to my phone, which is a “non”-smartphone. I then go and
check emails on my computer or using my ipod touch.
Somemanagedtheirlevelofengagementeitherthroughdeﬁnedsessionsorperiodsofignoring
email.
R48: [...] I do, however, do a 24-hour email hiatus once per week.
R42: I try not to check it in ﬁrst hour of day. I check once I get engrossed in
some other work. This way, I just read through them in a hurry. / If I start my
day by reading mails then I read a lot of them and go to their links also
P13: I have a very organized system of how I read and respond to emails. I use
ﬂags and stars to denote which I need to respond to immediately. I also set aside
time, several times a day, to read and respond to emails.
These diﬀerent strategies evidence that the participants in my study are clearly aware of
several of the problematic aspects that I observed in my study. Furthermore, they are
thinking about them enough to develop speciﬁc interventions to mitigate their eﬀects. Their
strategies tend to acknowledge that they understand that engagement with email leads to
activity within email, which in turn breeds demands on them.
4.7 How Does Email Compare with Other Media?
Wheninvestigatingreasonsforemailuse,Iwasinterestedinhowitcomparedwithtraditional
media, e.g. television and radio. While there have been several studies on how the internet
as a whole compared with traditional media [Flanagin and Metzger, 2001; Papacharissi and
Rubin, 2000] (which included email as one aspect of usage), there have been no studies
speciﬁcally examining email itself.
In order to study the relationship between email usage and more traditional media, I utilized
methods and practices drawn from Uses and Gratiﬁcations Theory (UGT). The primary
method that UGT draws its results from is through the correlation between survey responses
and self reported usage. While, there is no deﬁnitive survey that one can use in UGT, there
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 4. Attending to Email 60
are similar sets of questions and common gratiﬁcations used from study to study which I
drew from. However, I was able to also draw from the gratiﬁcations sought as reported by
the users in their diaries and previous surveys. This provides an additional diﬀerentiation
between this survey and previous ones, in that my survey questions are more grounded in
qualitative data that is standard in UGT studies. Another point of diﬀerentiation is that,
for a subset of my participants, I am able to correlate the survey responses with actual usage
statistics that I gathered in the email usage logging phase of the study.
4.7.1 Uses and Gratiﬁcations Survey
I sent out a call for participation to several Virginia Tech listserves, as well as to the partici-
pants in the previous phases of my study. Through the responses it becomes even more clear,
especially when coupled with the results of the diary studies, that the primary gratiﬁcations
sought for email use are work related (Figure 4.5).
Further investigation of these responses shows agreement with many of gratiﬁcations sought
fromthediaryentries. Theseincludekeepinguptodatewithworkactivities,routinesessions,
pressure to check email, and wanting to appear professional. As expected, respondents felt
that email was important to their job. One new insight is that users enjoyed ﬁnding new
emails, while I suspected this I had no direct evidence of this in my diary entries.
While the relative uniformity in the gratiﬁcations sought as reported by my users is certainly
enlightening, it does take some of the power away from the UGT method of analysis. This is
primarilybecausewithinUGTresearch, theresponsestothevariousgratiﬁcationssoughtare
correlatedwiththeselfreportedusagestatisticsfromusers. Therefore,diﬀerentgratiﬁcations
lead to diﬀerent levels of use. However, I ﬁnd no evidence of correlations between the
gratiﬁcations sought and levels of usage.
The relative uniformity of the responses of my survey take some of the power away from the
method of analysis typically used in uses and gratiﬁcation work. Within uses and gratiﬁca-
tion, the responses to the various gratiﬁcations sought are correlated with the self reported
usage statistics from users. Therefore, diﬀerent gratiﬁcations lead to diﬀerent levels of use.
However, inmyﬁndings, Iﬁndnoevidenceofcorrelationsbetweenthediﬀerentgratiﬁcations
sought and levels of usage.
To determine the diﬀerent relationship between gratiﬁcations sought and usage, I used a
similar approach as LaRose and Eastin [2004] in grouping the expected outcomes from media
use into several sets. I deviate from the categorization of LaRose and Eastin [2004] by
removing the Monetary Outcomes and adding several questions related speciﬁcally to email
use that were drawn from my diary analysis. I have indicated each of the questions that I
have added in the list below by marking them with **. These sets are constructed as:

Table 4.3: Pearson correlation coeﬃcients for UGT survey, no correlations were signiﬁcant.
The eﬀect of the consensus among my respondents can be seen in Table 4.3, where no
signiﬁcant correlation is found. This trend continues when I restrict the set of participants
that I have real usage data for, in that no signiﬁcant correlation is found.
This speaks to a consensus of use among my respondents and diﬀerent levels of use are more
to do with external factors than gratiﬁcations sought.
4.7.2 Comparison with Other Media
UGT is a useful way to investigate several diﬀerent aspects of media use. In the absence of
signiﬁcant correlations between email usage and gratiﬁcations sought, I found a diﬀerence
between email and more traditional media. Mainly, that the gratiﬁcations sought from email
use have more or less converged around ones that are work related. This is somewhat in
contrast to the assumptions that UGT is built upon, basically that the variance in gratiﬁca-
tions sought can be used to predict media usage. As the data that I gathered did not exhibit
this trait, it is not surprising that there was no evidence of any predictive power. That said,
the results did validate the reasons/gratiﬁcations found in the diary responses for email use.
In closing, the comparison to media such as television and radio found more diﬀerences that
similarities. This provides further motivation for comparing email usage more with commu-
nication media (e.g. phone), as opposed to media that are primarily ones of consumption
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 4. Attending to Email 64
(e.g. television). This provides further evidence that the external factors, or the precondi-
tions of the email corpus are the most signiﬁcant factor in email usage. This makes sense in
comparison to the phone, if one does not receive or make any calls they are not very likely
to use the phone very much (for talking at least).
4.8 Discussion
When discussing how users are attending to email, I feel that it is important to look at
email primarily as a communication medium. This is because the most important activi-
ties that occur in email are centered around communication and conversation-like threads.
This is made clear by the amount of time that I found the participants engaging in these
activities, as well as their reasons for checking email which were centered around these types
of interactions. In examining emails as a conversation medium, the decisions to attend to
emailareinﬂuencedbysimilarfactorsasconversationalopenings, particularlyconversational
openings on the phone. Contrasting the manner in which aspects of conversational openings
(especially the process of receiving a summons) function over face-to-face, phone, and email
gives insight into some of the roots of the issues that I found in my study.
4.8.1 Email Messages as Summons
First, let me clearly explain what aspect of email usage I consider a summons. Schegloﬀ
[1968] called summons ‘attention getting mechanisms’ and I ﬁnd that the manner in which
notiﬁcations appear, ring, or whichever ﬂavor they take are clearly similar to a ringing
phone or a person requesting their attention. Therefore, I consider receiving a notiﬁcation
about an email a summons. While, Schegloﬀ originally meant for summons to be speciﬁcally
for conversational openings, I feel that the nature of email necessitates some ﬂexibility in
this aspect of its deﬁnition. This is because of the indiscriminate way that email clients
issue notiﬁcations for email messages and the amount of noise that is typical of the email
channel. Therefore,inthecommunicationmediumofemailthereexiststhenearlyguaranteed
possibility of receiving a false summons.
To be more explicit about what I do not consider a summons, and how some conversations
may lack it, let us explain some instances that are similar to a summons. I do not consider
the unread count a summons, it is an indicator of the number of unread messages and does
not contain the same draw or speciﬁcity that is required for a summons. The unread count is
a ﬁgure against a background, if one is used to a high unread mail count it is not indicative in
any precise way. However, I imagine if the user notices a shift in the unread count it becomes
more distinct against the background. This, in part, is precisely what inbox management
techniques like ‘Inbox Zero’ seek to do, make any shift in the unread count distinct against
the background of email. Contrast this with a ringing phone, that may lack information
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 4. Attending to Email 65
about the summoner, it is still speciﬁcally from someone requesting to begin a conversation
with the answerer. Furthermore, I do not consider a single unread message in one’s inbox
a summons to a conversation, while it certainly shares some aspects with a summons, it
simply does not satisfy the condition of being an ‘attention getting mechanism.’ The only
thing that I consider a summons within the email channel is the notiﬁcation that you have
received an email from a speciﬁc person.
The fact that an email conversation can occur without a summons, is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence
frominitiatingaconversationface-to-faceoroverthephone. Whentheindiscriminatenature
of issuing a summons within the email client is coupled with the large amount of noise that
I found in the email channel, a reason for my participants’ anxiety around missing an email
and their reasons for maintaining engagement with email becomes quite evident. There is no
guarantee that a summons will be issued for a conversation in email, or that you will receive
a summons if it is issued.
4.8.2 Emails as Requests for Attention
Toexpandontheconceptofemailsassummons,Iseeeachemailasarequestforsomeamount
of attention, no matter how little attention or how remote the possibility of receiving the
attention. Only asubsetoftheserequestsreceiveasummons fromtheinterfaceandafurther
subset of those requests are true summons to a conversation. Part of the diﬃculty in using
email is distinguishing summons or requests for a conversation, from relevant informational
email, and spam email. As each email is a request for attention, I propose that there are
roughly four groups of emails based on the level of attention that they necessitate.
• Ignore: Many messages that are ignored have no realistic expectation that the recipi-
ents will properly read the email, let alone respond to them. Some of these messages
even explicitly say to not respond to them, other examples include spam mail and
mass advertisements. In my study 45% of emails went unread (speciﬁcally 4352/9578
messages went unread).
• Accountable Non-answer: An accountable non-answer response is when the recipient
is expected to engage with the email, but not reply to it. An example is a newsletter
that is emailed to a list, where the sender expects receivers to attend to the message
and keep abreast of certain topics, but not reply to the message. This is evidenced in
my study by the large amount of read mail that was not replied to. More speciﬁcally
of the 5226 messages read only 619 were responded to, meaning that the majority of
read messages do not require a response.
• Postponed Reply: Some emails require a reply, but do not require an immediate reply.
The responses to these emails can wait till a later session. I saw evidence of this in
routine sessions, where users replied to already read messages. In the messages that
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 4. Attending to Email 66
I captured both the receiving and replying (491 messages) 145 were postponed by 30
minutes or more. Of these 145 messages, 39 were postponed for more than 12 hours,
and no messages were postponed for more than 24 hours.
• Immediate Reply: Some messages arrive beckoning an immediate response. I found
evidenceofthisinthediariesandlogswhentheparticipantsreportseeinganotiﬁcation
and replying to it right away. I also found evidence in the logs when participants read
the message and immediately replied. Of the 491 messages that I captured both the
receipt and reply, 346 of them were replied to within 30 minutes, and 207 were replied
to in 3 minutes or less.
4.8.3 Answering an Email Summons
What I consider to be an answer to a summons over email is not obvious and requires some
additionalexplanationaswell. InordertocompletelyexplainwhatIcategorizeasananswer,
I must pull apart what happens to an email that a summons has been issued for. First, the
sender composes an email that requires a reply and sends it. The next requirement for a
summons to be issued is that the sender of the email must receive and acknowledge a speciﬁc
notiﬁcation about the email. The answer to the summons happens when the receiver directs
their attention to the notiﬁcation. However, a particularity of email is that the completion of
this sequence (or whether it ever happens) is completely opaque and unknown to the sender
of the email. The sender of an email does not know if a summons has been issued.
However, this sequence (the issuing and answering of the summons) by deﬁnition is non-
terminal, and upon attending to the email an obligation is placed on the receiver to respond
to this message. We see direct acknowledgement of this responsibility (and the opaqueness
to the sender) in the anxiety over ‘missing’ an important email in our diary entries. The
sender of the email only knows that their message has been seen and acknowledged after
they receive the response to the email. The physical barrier between the summoner and
answerer in the conversation is now even wider and contains a temporal element to it. Due
to the physical and temporal barrier that is a result of the asynchronous nature of email,
the single exchange of a message and its response has a number of opening sequences packed
into it. This is diﬀerent from the cases of phone and face-to-face, where sequences are more
atomic because, as the communication is synchronous, they do not necessitate interleaving
sequences.
4.8.4 Cumbersome Conversations
Another aspect of email as a conversation medium that I gain insight into through lever-
aging the summons-answer concept is their sometimes cumbersome nature. Each turn in a
conversation over email requires the directing of attention to the conversation when another
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 4. Attending to Email 67
turn has been completed by the participant. This may or may not be a summons on the
interface, however, with each turn the request for attention is re-initiated and several actions
must be remembered, or re-established by each participant. This is why the functionality of
email threads is so useful. At each turn accountable actions must at least be recalled by the
participant beginning their part of the turn. The re-initiation of an email conversation at
each turn, coupled with the requisite interleaving of sequences, can make email conversations
cumbersome and diﬃcult.
4.8.5 Determining Interruptibility
The manner in which a summons is dispatched and answered within email points to an
interesting contrast between the diﬀerent mediums of face-to-face, phone, and email. This
contrast is in the transition of the responsibility in determining interruptibility shifting from
the summoner to the answerer. In face-to-face conversations Schegloﬀ [2004] notes that a
great deal of the decision on the interruptibility of the answerer is done by the summoner.
It is simply rude to interrupt people in the middle of a conversation or activity. This is
less true when issuing a summons over the phone, in that the only real decision is what
time is reasonable to make a call. However, it is not beyond expectation (especially before
answering machines and caller id) that you will have to call the person back later. Move
to email and nearly all of the decisions for interruptibility transfer to the answerer. It is
completely acceptable to email someone at 3AM (contrary to Schegloﬀ’s phone example).
Instead it is considered far more socially unacceptable (as evidenced in my survey results
and diary entries) to take time to respond to an email. In this way the receiver, or answerer,
of the summons is now almost entirely responsible for determining (or constructing) the
appropriate moment for the interruption, as well as maintaining engagement with email as
to not miss any conversations.
4.9 Conclusion
My ﬁndings suggest that email is disruptive to users’ work and lives, even when they are not
directly engaged with it. Email usage has many of its users in a state of anticipation that
can cause anxiety or at least pique curiosity. The lack of proper notiﬁcations or signals to
make informed decisions to attend to email adds to this problem. While some of my ﬁndings
uphold intuition and commonly held beliefs, my principled investigation into these matters
has increased the depth of understanding of these phenomena. My contribution to this ﬁeld
of research is in bringing focus to email as a conversation medium and situating common
problems within CA.
Through the lens of CA, I am able to explain in what manner many of the commonly known
problems with email are in fact problematic. Take for example the unread count, through
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 4. Attending to Email 68
my analysis I have established that this mechanism is not being used by my participants
and, situated within CA, am able to cite their lack of summons as a root. Other studies have
established the anxiety around email [Wainer et al., 2011;Chase and Clegg,2011; Reinke and
Chamorro-Premuzic, 2014], my analysis has found that much of this anxiety is rooted in the
lack of a reliable mechanism to receive summons and the worry that a user has ‘missed’ an
important email. Furthermore, I found that this was an important worry as the projection
of ones eﬃcacy is highly linked to the promptness with which they respond to important
messages.
In contrast to the large concern with email triage [Freed et al., 2008; Whittaker et al., 2004;
Venolia and Neustaedter, 2003; Nardi et al., 2002; Cselle et al., 2007; Faulring et al., 2010;
Vacek, 2014], I found that my participants were well suited to locating important messages
(or the lack thereof). I found this through the explicit linking of diary entries with usage
sessions, where I found that when users were expecting an important message the sessions
were quite short, suggesting that they did not spend very long looking for this message. I
also found that ‘pruning’ sessions were also quite short, suggesting that the rating of non-
important messages was quite eﬃcient.
Additionally, as a result of my study I am able to give insight into my original questions.
What aspects of email grab user attention and draw them in? The pressure, whether real or
imagined, involved around promptly responding to emails that are part of a conversation is
a key factor in drawing users into email. Couple this with the non-deterministic nature of
how summons are issued within the email client and it is easy to see the reasons for routine
sessions, anxiety over missing email, and the draw of the notiﬁcations.
What level of engagement with email do users maintain while not using the application? I
ﬁnd evidence for a relatively high level of engagement with email. This is evidenced by the
anxiety over missing an important email and the simple requirement imposed on users by
the interface lacking mechanisms to assist in maintaining engagement with email.
What activities are they doing and what takes longer? As one might expect reading, com-
posing, and replying to messages is what leads to longer sessions. Interestingly, pruning
messages (deleting or archiving) is not associated with longer sessions. My participants
seem rather well suited to ﬁnding the messages that mattered to them. Perhaps the focus
aroundtriagingmessages[Freedetal.,2008;Whittakeretal.,2004;VenoliaandNeustaedter,
2003; Nardi et al., 2002; Cselle et al., 2007; Faulring et al., 2010; Vacek, 2014] is more about
making it more obvious that you have received an important message.
What are the consequences of attending to email? Users became further distracted than
they originally intended in 23% of my diary entries. I call this getting lost in email. This in
turn could have more negative implications in the cost of resuming their work [Mcfarlane,
1997a; Czerwinski et al., 2000a; Cutrell et al., 2001a; Franke et al., 2002a; Adamczyk and
Bailey, 2004; Mark et al., 2008; Hemp, 2009]. It seems to me (and my participants through
their strategies) that engagement with email leads to additional email activity, which leads
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 4. Attending to Email 69
to additional demands on users time.
Do users develop diﬀerent strategies that indicate awareness of these diﬀerent factors? I saw
that users employ a number of strategies, similarly to previous research and their recom-
mendations [Chase and Clegg, 2011; Hemp, 2009; Bradley et al., 2013]. From as basic to
just saying they respond promptly, to having routine sessions, and to even turning oﬀ the
notiﬁcations on their phone. The combination of the strategies that I saw my users develop,
I feel, is a clear indicator of awareness and concern for the very issues that I encountered in
my study. Moreover, as the majority of these strategies (with the exception of projecting an
image of responsiveness [Tyler and Tang, 2003]) are around the limiting of attention paid
to email, I see this as evidence to the destructive draw of email and somewhat contrary to
several functional directions of email (e.g. always-on access and push notiﬁcations).
I do not address the eﬃcacy of one strategy over the other, however, I hypothesize that
(similarly to previous PIM studies [Jones, 2007; Teevan et al., 2007]), there are various
strategies that users employ and prefer for themselves.
4.10 Recommendations
My study points to a broad need to remember and refocus on email as a communication
medium and functionality that assists email users in communicating and maintaining their
relationships. Many activities occur in email (work, task management, etc.), this is perfectly
reasonable as one place that communication occurs is in email. Put more simply anything
that I am doing, I can communicate about that activity through email, as it is a rich commu-
nication medium. While much research has focused on the individual activities that occur
in email, researchers and designers must keep in mind that these activities are accomplished
through communication. Supporting this communication and the conversations that support
them is vital to making email less stressful for its users. Perhaps the current trend of adding
functionality to email clients, which often has the eﬀect of increasing the complexity and
number of decisions involved in triage, should be reexamined, and the intuitions behind them
aﬃrmed. My ﬁndings, coupled with other recent research (i.e. Whittaker et al. [2011] showed
that the advantages of ﬁling may not be exactly as assumed), suggest new functionality is
not representative of where the bulk of time in email is spent.
There is of course functionality being proposed and research being done along these lines.
MinEMail [Rector and Hailpern, 2014], for example is trying to elevate important notiﬁca-
tions to an SMS message. However, I suggest that functionality to limit the notiﬁcations
that are issued for non-conversational emails be investigated as well. Also, based on my CA
of email, I believe that putting tools for determining urgency, escalation, etc. in the hands of
the sender is problematic. As CA informs us, these decisions are a matter for the two parties
to determine and the acceptance of the status by the recipient is crucial. If these decisions
were solely in the hands of the senders, then the result is recipients to treat them much like
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 4. Attending to Email 70
the ‘boy who cried wolf.’
Expecting an email. The anxiety that my participants felt around email points clearly at
two things: ﬁrst, that email, or at least the expectations around it, is being moved from
an asynchronous to a synchronous communication medium; second, that email has several
deﬁcienciesinthisregardthatcanbemitigatedwithafewchanges. Thismove, ofemailfrom
asynchronous to synchronous, and the expectations around it, are evidenced in a number
of my ﬁndings, but most starkly in the number of emails that were immediately replied to
(207/491), as well as in the amount of anxiety and import that my participants placed on
sending prompt responses to emails.
Another recommendation that I have is to remove the ephemeral nature around summons,
by reducing the indiscriminate nature that notiﬁcations are issued by and receiving notiﬁ-
cations for conversation based emails. One aspect that could also reduce the anxiety of my
participants around the expectation of an email, is to provide functionality to elevate the
notiﬁcation, or summons, to a particular sender that they are anticipating. This set of func-
tionality could help to remove the ephemeral, indiscriminate, and non-deterministic nature
of the summons, which is one of the primary sources of anxiety among my participants. Note
that this is diﬀerent from establishing an entirely new inbox for important people, similar
to Apple’s VIP inbox1.
Channels of communication. As there are clearly emails that have diﬀerent levels of im-
portance, I feel that they should be more clearly distinguished within the email channel.
A recent example of functionality that is moving towards this direction is Gmail’s tabbed
inbox2, which groups messages into Primary, Social, Promotions, Updates, and Forums.
Further study is required to see if further modiﬁcations to the unread count in the new
Gmail interface would have an impact on attention to email.
Simply put, email tools must do a better job of letting users manage the relationships and
conversations within their email, instead of it requiring them to maintain ever vigilant to
any change.

Chapter 5
Attending to Messages
This chapter presents the results of a laboratory experiment that investigates the process
of determining the relevance of diﬀerent email messages. Presumably, the more relevant
a message is, the more likely the participant would be to read the message, which in the
previouschapterwasfoundtobeastrongcorrelatewithsessionlength. Inthiswaythestudy
helps to ﬁll in another piece of the process of attending to email. Speciﬁcally, this study
examines the ﬁrst part of the email triage process, by considering that recipients ﬁrst need
to understand what the email is about, situate this information in regards to themselves,
and ﬁnally determine the relevance of the email for processing. In the previous chapter,
I found that much of the work involved in email is around reading and writing messages.
This often involved an ongoing relationship, in which the responsibilities associated with
managing the relationship were cited as a cause of stress. Following this line of thought, this
research focuses on the eﬀect of the strength of this relationship on the diﬃculty associated
with determining the relevance of an individual email message.
To measure the relationship to the sender, I used a Likert scale ranging from Unimportant
to Very Important. Presumably, more important relationships are built on an established
common ground, which makes determining the relevance of an email from an important
person easier. I also prompt participants for the amount of contact that they have with the
person, ranging from Never to At least once a day. To measure the diﬃculty of determining
relevancy I use the amount of time it takes to make the determination.
As such, there are two primary goals for this research, ﬁrst, quantifying the eﬀect of the
relationship between the recipient and sender on the diﬃculty of determining relevance; and
second, to better understand which information the recipients use to make determinations
about the relevance of an email.
Secondarily, this study informs the relationship between the diﬀerent components of each
email (e.g. sender and topic) and its overall importance. This study also informs the general
eﬀect of the relevancy of a message and how diﬃcult, in terms of the length of time, it
71
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 5. Attending to Messages 72
is to make a determination about the importance of diﬀerent categories of email. More
speciﬁcally, it answers the question of whether it is quicker (and perhaps therefore easier) to
decide an email is irrelevant or relevant.
The results of the study help to provide a better understanding of how the relationship be-
tweentherecipientandthesendereﬀectstheabilityofanindividualtomakeadetermination
about an email message’s relevance.
The operating hypothesis of the study is that participants would be able to decide very
quickly on the relevancy of an email sent by individuals on the extremes of the scale. That is,
emailssentbyVeryImportant individualsandUnimportant individualswouldbethequickest
decisions. Thiswouldbebecausesomeonethatisveryimportanttotherecipientwouldlikely
sendveryimportantemails,andsomeonethatisnotveryimportantwouldnot. Furthermore,
the most diﬃcult determinations about relevance would be emails sent by individuals in the
middle, as this represents the largest amount of ambiguity. My presumption is that users
would need to fully engage with an email from a sender that they are acquainted with,
because they would not be sure either from simply reading the sender email address and
they would have a reduced amount of common ground that would preclude the ability to
skim the subject and body. Some exceptions to this may be someone that occupies multiple
facets to the sender (e.g. someone that is both a coworker and friend).
The contents of this chapter are as follows. First, I address the question of how the rela-
tionship as measured by the post-questionnaire eﬀected the length of determining relevance.
Following this, I look at the relationship between the relevance of the components of the
email and its overall relevance. I then revisit the log data to validate and compare these
laboratory ﬁndings with the session details. Finally, I discuss my interpretation of these
ﬁndings and discuss their implications.
5.1 Studies Utilized
This chapter draws from the results of:
• Study 1 – The primary source of data in this chapter is drawn from the laboratory
study, these results are used to interrogate how decisions about relevancy are made on
individual emails.
• Study 3 – The IMAP logs are used to verify and compare some of the ﬁndings in usage
data.

5.2 Relationship Strength and Decision Length
The primary question that this study is interrogating is the eﬀect of the relationship between
thesenderondecisionlength. Totestmyhypothesisofacquaintancesbeingthemostdiﬃcult
to make determinations for I performed several analyses on the gathered data.
AnalysisusingaShapiro-Wilktestshowedthatthevariableswereofnon-normaldistribution.
Therefore, a Spearman correlation matrix was used to determine any correlations of interest.
The average time that it took for participants to make a determination on relevance was
6.37 (σ = 6.15).
A negligible correlation was found between the sender relationship and decision time (ρ =
0.25,p = 0.0017). The smoothness plot of these points is relatively ﬂat, suggesting that there
is no eﬀect of sender relationship, in terms of the participants’ rating of importance, on the
amount of time that it takes to determine the relevance of an email message Figure 5.1.
A follow up question to this, is that even if a sender was not deemed important by a partic-
ipant, perhaps they had a large amount of contact with the sender. One would think that
the more contact a person has with a sender, the easier it would be to make a determination
about the relevance of their emails. However, I ﬁnd no evidence to support this hypothesis
(ρ = 0.01,p = 0.89). The smoothness plot of this data also reveals a ﬂat trend, Figure 5.2,
suggesting that the amount of contact with a person does not have an eﬀect on the amount
of time that it takes to determine the relevance of an email message.
Much the same trend is found when looking at the relevance of the topic itself (ρ = 0.25,p =
0.0019). However, there is a signiﬁcant, weak positive correlation between the overall rele-
vance of the email and reponse time (ρ = 0.33,p < 0.0001). Suggesting that there is a slight
increase in the amount of time it takes to determine the relevance for an relevant email
versus an irrelevant email, Figure 5.3.
Overall, these ﬁndings suggest that neither the sender nor the topic has any relationship
with response time in making a determination about email. The overall relevancy of an
email seems to have very little eﬀect on the amount of time it takes to determine relevancy.
5.3 Overall Relevance of Email
Given that I found no evidence of a relationship between the relevance of an email and the
relationship between the sender and recipient of an email, a following question is how the
relationship between the sender and recipient impacts the overall relevance of an individual
email.
I again used a Spearman correlation to interrogate this question. As expected, there is
a relationship between the relevance of the sender and the overall relevance of an email
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 5. Attending to Messages 74
(ρ = 0.405,p < 0.0001), Figure 5.4. However, there was no evidence for a strong relationship
between the amount of contact with a sender and the overall relevance of an email (ρ =
0.282,p < 0.001), Figure 5.5. Going further, the relevance of the topic of an email shows
the strongest correlation with the overall relevance of the email (ρ = 0.612,p < 0.0001),
Figure 5.6.
This all seems to make intuitive sense, the content of an email is centered most around the
topic of the email. For example, I may get a joke from a close family member that I may not
consider relevant, while I may get a job oﬀer or a call for participation from someone that I
am unacquainted with. Generally, one gets more emails about a relevant topic from relevant
people, this is after all most likely why they are relevant people. Finally, just because you
see someone a lot does not necessarily mean that you ﬁnd them relevant, it may just be a
question of circumstance.
5.4 Comparing Laboratory Findings with Usage Data
Given the data that I gathered in my usage study, I am able to explore the nature of
relationships in email to some degree.
One aspect that I can provide insight for is the number of unique senders (as deﬁned by their
email address) that participants read emails from. This data is provided in Table 4.1. There
isahighstandarddeviationinrelationtothemean, showingtheamountofvariationbetween
the diﬀerent senders. Participant 16 read 239 emails from unique senders, reading by far
the largest diversity of senders. While, participant 20 read emails from only 5 individuals.
When I compare this with the overall activities from Table 4.1, participant 16 is one of the
heaviest users of email and participant 20 one of the lightest. This suggests the number of
relationships that one participates in over email impacts the usage of email and conﬁrms
intuition.
A second aspect that the usage logs can give insight into is the distribution of read emails
among the unique senders. For my participants in the usage study, the number of emails
read by participants drops steeply after the top few senders. This is illustrated by Figure 5.7,
where the number of emails received from each sender is represented in logarithmic scale and
each participant is represented by a diﬀerent line. In this graph the steep drop-oﬀ is quite
evident, where the participants have only read one or two emails from the majority of unique
senders.
5.5 Discussion
The results of this study did not support the initial hypothesis. In fact, no strong correlation
was found between any of the measures and the decision time. However, there were some

signiﬁcant correlations found between several of the variables and overall relevance, e.g. the
topic of the email and the sender of the email.
That said, there are several limitations of this study that may impact these ﬁndings. First,
important variables were not examined during this study require further investigation. An
example of such a variable is the length of the email. Secondly, temporal context (e.g.
an email about a current project or an email that was received during a speciﬁc time in
the day) may play an important role in determining the relevance of an email. Lastly,
since participants had already made determinations about the email and handled them an
additional time for experiment preparation, their familiarity with the email was artiﬁcially
high. If this were true they would be using more retrospective recollection then prospective,
which could skew the results.
Even given these limitations, it seems that there is not a great discrepancy between the
amount of time it takes to determine the relevance of an email. The results suggest that,
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 5. Attending to Messages 76
generally speaking, what is taking up the decision time is simply consuming the information.
There are likely emails that do take more time, some of these can be seen in the graph as
outliers, butforthemostpartacursoryengagementwiththecontentoftheemailissuﬃcient
for making a determination of relevance.
So it seems that the determination of relevance is fairly constant amongst emails and takes
roughly the same amount of time to contextualize the email in working memory. Perhaps the
determining factors of decision time are simply how distributed the information is amongst
the diﬀerent ﬁelds of the email, i.e. the topic refers to the sender and the date, and the
amount of information contained within the email, i.e. number of topics and detail. The
results that suggest this is that upon inspection of the emails that took much longer (around
an order of magnitude longer in fact) were all of considerable length and contained multiple
references to topics in them. This seems to lead to the direction that the most important
determining factor in decision time is the amount of information that needs to be situated
by the recipient.
One unexpected result of this study was the correlation found between topic relevance and
overallrelevance. Uponfurtherreﬂection,however,thismakesintuitivesense. Theoverriding
heuristic that recipients of emails use in making a determination about email is not if the
email is important to someone else, but instead, if this email is important to them. For
instance, if someone receives and email with a job oﬀer from a relatively unknown individual,
the email is still very relevant to the recipient. On the other hand, if someone receives a joke
that has been forwarded from a close member in his or her social circle, the email is still
unimportant.
Even when taking into consideration the eﬀect on relationships on amount of time it takes to
decide how relevant an email is, relationships clearly matter in email use. That the number
of senders participants read varies widely and indicates diﬀerent levels of usage is one aspect
of this. That there are few relationships that the participantexchanged a great deal of emails
with indicates that there are some functionality enhancements that may be possible, with
relatively little eﬀort.

Chapter 6
Getting Lost in Email Sessions
In this chapter I add to the body of research around email through my investigation into how
email has the ability to draw its users down a path of interaction, almost against their will. I
isolate a particular aspect of this disruption, which is a phenomenon that I call getting lost in
email. This is the process of becoming further distracted from the original intent of an email
session, or a loss of agency over attention during an email session. This concept is similar to
chains of diversion [Iqbal and Horvitz, 2007] and work on interruptions [Czerwinski et al.,
2004]. However, my work is more focused on email, and how it leads to chains of diversion.
That is, what is the speciﬁc pull that the email medium has on its users attention. My belief
is that getting lost in email is a contributing factor to the feeling of being overloaded by
email, simply because if a user is unable to predict the amount of potential work that awaits
them in their email client, then it can become a source of tension (as seen in Chapter 4).
My hypothesis into how participants become lost in email is by encountering a series of
emails that require (or at least are thought to require) some form of immediacy in their
response, this takes email users down a path of interactions that is diﬃcult to resist. This
path leads users, unexpectedly, into more work than they had anticipated. Meaning that
users are pulled into email in a less deliberate, more situational manner.
To investigate these hypotheses I look at how the diﬀerent factors that I measured through-
out my study inﬂuence the frequency of getting lost. This gives insight into whether and how
users are getting lost in email. In order to isolate the diﬀerent factors that may be impact-
ing getting lost in email, I categorize them in three groups Predispositions, Preconditions,
and Mitigating Behaviors. Predispositions refers to the variability that may exist between
participants in their response to similar conditions, e.g. some participants may become lost
with the same number of unread emails and others may not. Preconditions refers to the
state of the email corpus at the moment before the session began, as well as the state of the
individual (e.g. upcoming deadlines). Lastly, Mitigating Behaviors are strategies that the
user has developed to manage email.
84
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 6. Getting Lost in Email Sessions 85
My investigation yields several ﬁndings. First, I establish that users are in fact getting lost
in email with fair frequency. Second, I ﬁnd that there are no reliable indicators given to
users to predict how long their next email session will be. Instead, they become lost by
encountering a series of emails that require (or at least are thought to require) immediacy
in their response. This takes email users down a path of interactions that is diﬃcult to
resist. This path causes users, unexpectedly, to enter into a longer session than they had
anticipated. Lastly, participants developed strategies to cope with getting lost, which shows
both awareness of the problem and its nature. The diﬀerent aspects of my research, coupled
with previous ﬁndings about attending to email (Chapter 4) give insight into how users can
get lost in email and why they might be frustrated with it.
Myinitialhypothesesaroundthisphenomenaweremetwithavaryingdegreeofconﬁrmation.
First, I hypothesized that users of email were getting lost to some degree, while this was
conﬁrmed my set of participants reported a higher degree of getting lost than I anticipated.
My second hypothesis was that the email state would have the greatest eﬀect on getting
lost (as well as frequency and duration of use). While this hypothesis was also conﬁrmed, I
expected that the number of unread messages would have some amount of correlation with
the number of times getting lost, which was unconﬁrmed. However, I did anticipate that
there was a lot of noise within the email channel and expected that the number of relevant
unread messages in the inbox would be more indicative of getting lost than just the raw
unread count. My hypotheses around the ability of ANT to correlate or explain individual
diﬀerences were not conﬁrmed, as I found no evidence to support any relationship.
In this chapter I ﬁrst detail the methods in my analysis, I then organize my investigations
into a series of questions around the phenomenon of getting lost in email, and ﬁnally I frame
the answers to these questions in terms of Predispositions, Preconditions, and Mitigating
Behaviors.
6.1 Studies Utilized
This chapter draws from the results of:
• Study 2 – Results from the survey are used to illustrate the pressure to maintain an
image of responsiveness that participants seemed to feel.
• Study 3 – The diary entries and IMAP logs are used to determine why participants
began their email sessions, whether or not they became lost, and what activities lead
to becoming lost.
• Study 4 – The results of the ANT are discussed and do not provide any evidence for
individual diﬀerences.

6.2 Are Users of Email Getting Lost?
Of the 14 participants in my study that completed diary entries, 9 (64%) reported that they
got lost in email. Participants reported being lost in 23% (47/204) of all diary entries. This
means, that in the email sessions that participants were prompted and responded to diary
prompts, they reported getting lost 23% of the time.
Interestingly, and unexpectedly, participants reported getting lost in email during both short
and long sessions. Figure 6.1 shows the breakdown of sessions by length and the number
of sessions where they reported being lost versus not. Surprisingly, there were many cases
where participants reported being lost in short, three minute sessions. However, these cases
only comprised 21% of the total number of three minute (180 seconds) sessions. This is
in contrast to the proportion of sessions greater than or equal to 12 minutes (720 seconds),
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 6. Getting Lost in Email Sessions 87
where participants reported becoming lost in 57% of the sessions. As a session becomes quite
long, it has a higher probability to get out of hand and the user getting lost.
There were a surprising number of very short sessions where the participant became lost.
Therefore, during a more detailed analysis where I looked speciﬁcally at these entries, I
found that participants often reported being further distracted by falling into chains of
diversion [Iqbal and Horvitz, 2007]. These chains took them outside of email and thus
outside my ability to track their activity. So it is possible that the short email sessions could
in fact be part of longer chains of diversion and I was able to capture just the beginning of
it. The quotes below are accompanied by details of what occurred during the session, these
diary entries represent short sessions where participants reported getting lost.
P1: I was expecting an email to my work account that hadn’t arrived so I checked
my personal (gmail) account. It wasn’t there either so I just archived a new email
in the inbox that I didn’t care about.
Session: Participant didn’t read any email, only moved emails. There was no
unread email.
P4: Checked incoming email, saved a bunch of attachments for an event later
tonight.
Session: Participant read 19 messages.
P5: [J]ust email, paid online bill
Session: Read 1 message
P13: Thesis work, TA jobs
Session: Participant read 2 messages, composed 3 messages, and replied to 2
messages.
P14: I read a couple emails, which had links to articles so I read the articles too.
Session: Participant read a lot of messages (or at least marked them as read),
68 messages in fact.
P15: Checked my email. There were a ton (I had been in a meeting for a while
and couldn’t check my email) so I had a bunch waiting for me. Responses to
some, not all. Didn’t even get around to reading them all.
Session: Read 11 messages, responded to a few. All messages marked as read.

Table 6.1: Binary logistic regression against getting lost (* p <= 0.1, ** p <= 0.05, ***
p <= 0.001.)
6.3 How are Users Becoming Lost?
Table 6.1 shows the results of a Binary Logistic Regression [McCullagh and Nelder, 1990]
using Got Lost as the dependent variable. The model was found to ﬁt signiﬁcantly better
than the null model using the likelihood ratio test (p < 0.001) with a log likelihood of
−91.29154(df = 12), furthermore the model correctly predicted 79% of the responses. The
model shows that the most important variables, relative to the others within the model, are
whether or not a participant was Interrupted, the number of Replies written, and the number
of Composed messages written.
Examining the Odds Ratios for these three variables reveals their relationship to whether or
not participants Got Lost. If a participant began the session under the condition of being
Interrupted, they were 3.025 times more likely to Get Lost. For each message that they
replied to during their session, they were 2.54 times more likely to Get Lost (e.g. the more
a participant replied to messages the more likely that they Got Lost). In contrast, for each
message that a participant Composed, they were 0.5 times less likely to Get Lost. Perhaps,
the purposeful act of going to email to compose a message creates a more focused path of
interaction. As opposed to engaging with the list of emails and replying to them, which
tends to pull participants towards further interactions.
Surprisingly, the number of emails read, new, or otherwise was not found to have a strong
eﬀect. This can be attributed to the large amount of noise that I observed in email. That
is, of all of the email that my participants received, roughly a third (32%) of emails went
unread, Figure 6.2. Keep in mind that this is not counting any of the spam or junk emails.
Furthermore 73% of messages remain in the Inbox and were not acted upon, Figure 6.3.

6.3.1 Maintaining an Image of Responsiveness
Further insight into why participants were more likely to become lost in sessions where they
were replying to emails can be gained from the various survey responses. In the survey one
question prompted them for what is successful about their email habits. While the original
intent of this question was to probe more about their email management practices, it instead
revealedamoreinterestinginsightintotheperceptionofemailetiquette. Duringtheanalysis
of the survey answers it became clear that there is a clear pressure felt by the participants
to maintain an image of responsiveness [Tyler and Tang, 2003; Fisher and Dourish, 2004].
These responses speak to the pressures that users feel when they encounter an email that
needs a response, further showing how certain emails can function similar to a summons
(Section 4.8.1). Below are a series of example responses, the language favorably comparing
their promptness with others’ lack of it is particularly striking in these responses.

quick enough. I also have emails well-organized into archive folders.
P10: I am prompt in responding to emails, and in reading important ones.
P11: I respond to necessary emails in a timely manner.
P12: I have a folder management system which works very well for storing emails
and ﬁnding them again if necessary. I read and respond to emails everyday such
that the sender of the email never has to wait more than 24 hours for a response
(unless I am on vacation).
R24: I read all my emails, unlike most people, so I don’t miss out on anything.
P21: I ﬁle my emails in a manor that allows me to ﬁnd importnat emails again
in the future. I also read my emails in a timely manner so as not to miss any
important information.
P48: I try to keep my inbox relatively clear, and respond to emails quickly and
eﬃciently, so they don’t back up. I also ﬁle things with the labels in Gmail, which
helps me ﬁnd things later.
6.3.2 Impact of Session Initiation
Figure 6.4 shows the proportion of diaries that reported getting lost vs. not getting lost
in relation to the reason for initiating the session. This ﬁgure shows that the chance for
getting lost is relatively similar between all sessions. In fact, the majority of the reasons are
within 15 percentage points of the global average of 23% (i.e. Reﬁnding at 33%, Anxiety at
22%, Expecting Communication at 36%, Down Time at 26%, Compose a Message at 23%,
Notiﬁcation at 26% and Routine at 17%), the only real outlier is Curiosity at 8%, perhaps
this is because these sessions were less directed and more open to whatever tasks lay waiting
in their inbox.
Based on these results the reason for initiating a session does not seem to have a large impact
on the probability to become lost during the subsequent session. Note that while the reason
for initiating a session does not have an impact, the manner in which it was started does.
As previously mentioned, whether or not the session was an interruption to another activity
did have an eﬀect.

6.4 The Role and Nature of Mitigating Behaviors
The participants in my study were clearly aware of the problematic nature of email. The
majority of the email strategies they reported were around the management of time instead
of emails. Respondents go so far as to structure not only their email use to minimize their
email time, but also structure their work day around email to avoid problematic usage.
While, I reported in the previous section the clear evidence that users maintained an image
of responsiveness, in these responses we see them deﬁning success in email more as limiting
the time spent.
Some respondents mentioned how they structure their work day around email. This ﬁrst
quote mentions how they take care to structure their access to email so that they are not
tempted to spend too much time reading everything that gets sent to them
R42: I try not to check it in ﬁrst hour of day. I check once I get engrossed in
some other work. This way, I just read through them in a hurry. If I start my
day by reading mails then I read a lot of them and go to their links also
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 6. Getting Lost in Email Sessions 93
Another quote mentions how this participant sets aside time several times a day to read and
respond to email.
P13: I have a very organized system of how I read and respond to emails. I use
ﬂags and stars to denote which I need to respond to immediately. I also set aside
time, several times a day, to read and respond to emails.
Someusersstructuretheiremailuseinsuchawayastohelpmanagetheirtimeandattention
spent on email. This participant mentions how they separate facets of their identity between
email and Facebook.
P26: I think I spend an appropriate amount of time emailing. I use emails
almost only for work and use facebook messages for social messaging.
Other respondents outlined the way in which they make more important messages more
salient than others, helping them to direct their attention only to the most important mes-
sages.
R31: Keeping important reminders and “to do” emails in my inbox (but every-
thing else in subfolders) keeps my professional life much more organized and helps
keep me on task.
R22: I manage them in folder so I know which ones are important and they go
directly to the folders and the rest unread doesn’t matter to me.
P18: I’m not sure how to measure success. I would say using the gmail labels and
folder system helps me ﬁnd emails and to remember which ones need to be looked
at soon (like the ones labeled ‘scholarship’ need to get looked at sooner than some
others).
R39: I ﬂag emails that require action for later reference and act on email im-
mediately so I don’t forget to do it.
Others, structure usage of email to avoid wasting time in email and to be eﬃcient.
R35: I deal with the emails as required within a reasonable time. Usually I
only deal with a particular piece of email once. It either gets ﬁled, deleted, or
responded to. Once I’ve responded to an email, I will ﬁle it away. The reply will
then generate a new email in my inbox.

6.5 The Eﬀect of Preconditions
One of my primary hypotheses in this research is that the state of the email corpus had the
greatest eﬀect on email usage. In Section 4.5.2 I outlined that, while the unread count was
a poor indicator of session length, the number of messages read was a strong correlate with
session length. Previously in this Chapter (Section 6.3), I also outlined how the number of
messages that a user replied to was a primary indicator to whether or not the participant
had become lost during that session. Clearly based on these ﬁndings email state has a clear
eﬀect on what happens in individual sessions. An additional question is whether or not there
is a more global relationship between aspects of email use and the frequency of engaging with
email.
Whenexaminingthecorrelations, Table6.2, betweenthetotalmeasuresforparticipants over
the course of the study with both the number of times sessions that I captured and total
usage time a slightly diﬀerent pattern emerges. Again it is evident that the raw count of new
messagesthattheparticipantsreceivedthroughoutthestudyisnotacorrelateforeithertotal
time spent or number of sessions. One diﬀerence emerges in the number of email sessions, in
that participants that engage in deleting or moving emails (pruning sessions), engage with
emailmoreoftenandformoretotaltime. Thisisnotsurprising, eventhoughitrunscontrary
to the relationship to the length of individual sessions. Thus, the correlates around total
usage are around messages that have actions associated with them (read, deleted, moved,
composed, replied) and this indicates that participants spend overall more time in email.
This means that the eﬀect of email state on email use is slightly diﬀerent than I initially
imagined. That is, while it is true that email state has a large eﬀect on the duration and
frequency of use, it is not true that the simple number of new messages received seems to
have an eﬀect. This is inline from the previous ﬁnding where read messages was a predictor
of getting lost and not new or unread messages.
6.6 Evidence of Predisposition
A hypothesis that did not yield any results was that the Attentional Network Test (ANT)
would correlate in some way with email use, particularly getting lost. When tested for
correlation with diﬀerent totals of aspects of email use, they did not yield any meaning
results, Table 6.3, none of the coeﬃcients were signiﬁcant.
The lack of relationship is further seen when examining the plots of the ANT scores, for
example against the total duration of email use, Figures 6.5, 6.7, 6.6. No pattern emerges
from my data and the plots are more or less distributed in scatter shot.
Even though ANT did not yield results, I wanted to determine if there were any indica-
tions of individual diﬀerences between the participants in my study. To do this, I examined

correlations for the individual participants, Figure 6.8. When examining the individual cor-
relations with session length there is a similar pattern within some aspects (read, composed,
replied) which are all are signiﬁcant correlations for each of the participants. However, the
strength of that correlation varies widely. This seems to suggest that there are individual
diﬀerences in how our participants responded to similar situations. However, more detailed
analysis is required, as well as a diﬀerent method for detecting or categorizing the aspects
of the individual participants for this to be proven.

6.7 Conclusion
When I began this study, I imagined that it would be diﬃcult to capture sessions where
participants got lost in an email session. That I captured so many of these sessions speaks
somewhat to the eﬀectiveness of the method that I employed, but speaks in a much larger
part to the unexpectedly high frequency that participants found themselves doing more
within email than they had anticipated.
Therawcountofemail(unreadornot)wasnotfoundtoinﬂuencewhetherornotparticipants
became lost. This seems to be due to the large amount of noise the participants received.
Likewise, ﬁling and deleting messages seems to be a relatively easy thing for our participants
to do, as it was not found to cause users to become lost.

likely to result in getting lost. Likely this is representative of a similar phenomenon, where
the interruption is because of a notiﬁcation for an email that requires a response. These
ﬁndings lines up well with my previous analysis in Section 4.8, where I used Conversation
Analysis (CA) to frame emails as both summons and requests for attention. Clearly, emails
that require a reply are closer to conversations and function similarly to summons once they
are encountered (either through a notiﬁcation or viewing in the inbox). In both of these
cases it is clear that email, particularly emails that require a response, have the ability to
pull its users down a path of further interaction. Emails that required a response compelled
participants to reply to them, much like an ﬁrst-turn utterance compels a response utterance
in more conventional conversations.
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 6. Getting Lost in Email Sessions 98
I did not ﬁnd any evidence to support my primary hypothesis that the scores gathered from
ANT would help to explain the diﬀerences. However, I did ﬁnd several diﬀerences that
suggest that these diﬀerences are there. First, there was a large variation in the number of
times that participants reported being lost, and second, there was a large variance in the
correlation between common aspects (e.g. number of read or replied to emails) and session
length. More investigation into these diﬀerences is needed to determine their root causes.
The diﬀerent strategies that participants outlined show that much of the problem around
email is in managing the tension between the perceived social responsibility of promptly
responding to email (similar to the ﬁndings in Section 4.6) and limiting ones engagement
with email. Perhaps, the lengths participants went to in managing their engagement with
email belays some of the misconception of others expectations for prompt replies.

Conclusion
In this dissertation I have investigated getting lost in email. As part of this investigation I
have targeted several diﬀerent points of the process in email use, as well as exploring the
applicability of diﬀerent theories on email use. In this chapter I discuss my ﬁndings in a
holistic way.
In the ﬁrst section I outline the answers to the research questions that I set out to investigate
in this dissertation. In the second section I give an overview of the process of attending to
email and getting lost chronologically. This is followed by an overview of the themes that
I have uncovered in my research. Finally, I give my recommendations for email clients and
outline future work in the area of PIM.
7.1 Research Questions
7.1.1 RQ 1: When and how are users deciding to attend to email;
speciﬁcally, is it the result of user predisposition, precondi-
tions of email, mitigating behaviors, or social obligations?
To answer this question there were several aspects of email use that I needed to explore.
I hypothesized that users would engage with email for a complex set of reasons and that
email sometimes pulls its users down a path of interaction. My ﬁndings support that there
is a complex mixture of reasons that participants checked email, this is evidenced by the
numerous reasons cited in the diary entries, Section 4.2. However, I did not anticipate
how heavily social aspects of email use weigh on the decisions to attend to email. I initially
assumedthatemailusewouldbegreatlydrivenmechanicallybythenotiﬁcationsthatprompt
email use. While the mechanical nature of notiﬁcations certainly plays a role in attending to
email, the notiﬁcations that were mentioned in the diaries played more on social obligations
102
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 7. Conclusions and Future Work 103
to reply to a message than a simple mechanical interruption that takes participants attention
against their will, Section 4.2.1. While the mechanical interruption of a popup box or sound
may capture attention for a few seconds, they do not seem to draw users down a path of
interaction in and of themselves.
In fact, the same can be said about two of the three groups of features that I hypothesized
wouldimpactemailusage. Forinstance, inthePreconditions oftheemailcorpusIfoundthat
none of the simple, easily measurable preconditions impacted session length (Section 4.5).
That is, the raw counts like unread email, number of new emails, or even the proﬁle of the
senders had a measurable eﬀect on usage statistics. However, the length and outcome of
individual sessions were primarily impacted by the number of read emails and the number
of replies written. While it is somewhat plainly true that the more emails that a user reads,
the longer their session will be, it is striking than none of the other preconditions gives
insight into this. Suggesting that the social side of email use is complex. When looking at
Mitigating Behaviors, many of the behaviors were around the limiting of engagement with
email, Section 6.4. That is, my participants sought to limit the moments in the day that
they could encounter an email that drew them in. I had expected that there would be more,
obvious strategies like Inbox Zero, that would have an eﬀect on email use. The few such
strategies that I found had no measurable impact on session length. Finally, while I did
not ﬁnd any theory behind the Predisposition to email use, there does seem to be some
diﬀerences (Section 6.6), however, these are outweighed by the social Preconditions of the
email corpus.
An additional hypothesis that I had at the beginning of this research was that users of email
were being distracted by spurious notiﬁcations. However, I did not capture any incidents
of this happening in my diary study. However, based on the relative ease that participants
exhibitedinﬁndingrelevantemailsandhowshortpruningsessionswere(Sections4.5,5),Ido
not believe that spurious notiﬁcations lead to long sessions. The second or so of interruption
may indeed be damaging to ones cognitive ability or attention, but it does not lead to the
massive interruptions that I sought to investigate in this study. Notiﬁcations only lead to
these destructive sessions when they are about an email that is of some value to its recipient.
That is, only when it beckons to be answered. This hypothesis is therefore not conﬁrmed.
A related hypothesis or assumption, that is made by many email researchers, is that users
are having trouble ﬁltering through messages to ﬁnd the ones that are relevant to them. This
assumption has impacted the rather large amount of research around email triage and does
not seem to be true, for my participants at least. Individual decisions around email relevancy
are short, Chapter 5, and there was no evidence from my diaries or logs that ﬁnding relevant
emails is particularly diﬃcult. Likewise, this was not mentioned in the survey responses.
Perhaps, email triage is only a problem for exceptionally heavy users of email.
Lastly attentional network scores simply did not have a measurable impact on email use,
Section 6.6.

7.1.2 RQ 2: What is the level of engagement that users are main-
taining with email when not actively using email and how
does this feature in their decision to attend to email?
From my investigation it is clear that participants maintained a high level of engagement
with email when not actively using it, Section 4.3. I initially hypothesized that users of email
maintain a background engagement with email throughout the day, and this was conﬁrmed.
However, I uncovered more about the nature of this background engagement, in that it was
focused to a large degree on the anticipation of getting an email that they might miss, which
is highly linked to their want to project their eﬃcacy to others through prompt replies. I
think this anticipation serves as an explanatory factor for why some users focus on triage,
basically, a ‘clean’ inbox ampliﬁes the signal of a new email.
Another hypothesis was that users are aware of the last time they checked email and that
longer periods of inactivity can cause anxiety. In my diary study I found evidence that users
are aware of how long it has been since they last checked email, and at times this seems to be
a driving factor in checking it. The anxiety however, is more often about single emails from
a particularly important person as opposed to the inbox entering an increasingly unknown
state. The insight that I have gained from this investigation helps to outline why there
have been conﬂicting reports in the eﬀect of frequently checking email and anxiety. In one
study, Dabbish and Kraut [2006] found that more frequently checking email reduced email
related stress, while in another study, Bradley et al. [2013] found that frequently checking
email increased email related stress. I propose that these can both be true, checking email
reduces stress in the short term as it alleviates unknowns like, ‘did I receive that email yet.’
Whereas, it seems that email use begets email use, through actively controlling email use
users may discover that having to respond to an email right now is not quite as important
as they may have thought.
7.1.3 RQ 3: Once users have decided to attend to email, what are
the activities, predispositions, or preconditions that corre-
late with longer sessions and how do these relate to getting
lost?
MyhypothesesforthisquestionfollowedcloselytothatofResearchQuestionOne, Iexpected
that entering an email session would be determined by the Preconditions as determined by
email state and that getting lost would be determined by the Predisposition of the partic-
ipant. This set of hypotheses was unconﬁrmed. First, the reasons for starting an email
session were quite varied, and there were very few mentions of the email state as the reason
for starting a session, Section 4.2. Instead, the diary entries were focused on routine or a
more internal motivation like anxiety or boredom. Second, instead of the predispositions of
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 7. Conclusions and Future Work 105
the participant being the primary predictor of getting lost it was the email state that had
the most power in predicting whether or not a participant would become lost. Therefore,
it seems that checking email was often determined by some intrinsic reason for checking,
whereas what happened during the session was primarily determined by what was in the
inbox.
My additional, more speciﬁc, hypothesis around attending to email was that users with more
responsibilities would check email more often. While, I did not have direct evidence in terms
of a quantitative measure, responsibilities were mentioned in a number of the diary entries.
Therefore, this seems plausible but remains unconﬁrmed.
I also hypothesized that the Preconditions of email speciﬁcally impacted getting lost. The
primary factor that I thought would be involved in getting lost was the number of important
messages, this was in fact the primary indicator of session length (in terms of read messages
being a strong correlate with session length). However, this was not a strong indicator of
whether or not a participant would become lost, instead a subtly diﬀerent factor was a strong
indicator of becoming lost, messages that required a reply (Section 6.3).
7.1.4 RQ 4: Are the gratiﬁcations that users expect out of their
email use related to personal or professional reasons and
how do these help to predict email use?
For this question I hypothesized that email use was more around professional activities,
mostly because social activities with friends and family have migrated away from email over
the years. This hypothesis, that email is centered mostly around professional activities, is
conﬁrmed. This was evident in the UGT survey (Section 4.7), where professional activities
were cited more often that personal. This was also evident in the ﬁrst survey (Section 6.3.1),
when respondents cited projecting their eﬃcacy through prompt replies and projecting a
professional impression to others. This was again evidenced in the diary entries, where
concern over professionalism was made obvious as well.
7.2 Overview of Process
In this section I tie together all of the pieces of my research. Each study targeted diﬀerent
points of time in the process of engaging with email and becoming lost. I outline the process
in roughly the chronological order that they occur.
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 7. Conclusions and Future Work 106
7.2.1 Maintaining Engagement
Throughout their day users of email are maintaining a level of engagement with email, even
when they are not actively using email. A reason for this is the combination of the poor
indicators available to them and their want to respond promptly to important emails. This
is evidenced by participants’ diary responses.
Users of email are aware of the constant engagement that they have with email and some
try to minimize it. There is a tension in email use between users desire to be prompt in
responding to email and the need to limit their engagement in order to lessen the damage
to their attention. This is evidenced by the strategies for email that participants reported
in survey responses.
7.2.2 Attending to Email
Users are drawn into email by a combination of diﬀerent factors. These include notiﬁcations
for individual messages, expectations around receiving a message, or states like boredom.
Users also make very conscious decisions to attend to email as part their daily routine or to
compose a message to someone. These are all seen in their diary responses.
Many of the decisions to attend to email are around messages and communications with
individuals, instead of responding to a large unread count or the general status of the inbox.
Notiﬁcations for certain emails act as summons. While, many of the expectations that draw
users in are around missing a conversation, which can be attributed to the manner in which
summons function (or not) on email. A primary reason for these various phenomena is the
users’ desire to maintain an image of responsiveness. Compounding this, is that there are no
accurate predictors for session length or importance, other than determining which messages
will be read or replied to, as seen in the analysis of the usage logs.
7.2.3 Activities in the Client
Once users enter email their activities are composed of moving, deleting, reading, replying,
and composing. Triaging does not seem to take up an inordinately large amount of time, as
sessions that were comprised of deleting or moving did not take very long. This is true even
though there is quite a bit of noise in terms of email to be dealt with. There was also no
mention of trouble ﬁnding an email in the diary entries. Additionally, determining relevancy
of email in my lab study only consisted of a few seconds or less, which was constant across
diﬀerent types of emails. For these reasons, I am not conﬁdent that email triage is quite as
problematic for the majority of users as previous research assumes.
Theactivitiesthatdidtakealongtimearereading, writing, andtoalesserextentcomposing.
Reading was the strongest correlate for session length. While, replying to messages was the
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 7. Conclusions and Future Work 107
activity that most lead to getting lost.
There were clearly diﬀerent types of sessions from the activities: pruning sessions were ones
where messages were deleted or moved; composing sessions were more focused and other
activities did not occur as much; sessions that were an interruption pulled participants into
more activity; and undirected sessions (especially when there were messages that awaited
replies) pulled participants down a path.
All that said, when looking over a longer period of time (as opposed to individual sessions)
participants that received more email did spend more time in email over the course of the
study.
7.3 Themes
7.3.1 Applying Conversation Analysis to Email Use
When discussing how users are attending to email, I feel that it is important to look at
email primarily as a communication medium. This is because the most important activities
that occur in email are centered around communication and conversation-like threads. This
is evidenced by the large proportion of time that I found participants engaged in these
activities. Additionally, participants’ reasons for checking email were centered around these
conversation interactions. By framing emails as a conversation medium, it becomes apparent
that the decisions to attend to email are inﬂuenced by similar, if not the same, factors as
conversational openings (bearing a particular similarity with conversational openings on the
phone). Furthermore,bycontrastingthemannerinwhichaspectsofconversationalopenings,
particularly the process of receiving a summons function over face-to-face, phone, and email
gives insight into the roots of many issues that I encountered in my study.
First, I need to reiterate what aspect of email usage I consider to be a summons. Schegloﬀ
[1968] called summons ‘attention getting mechanisms’ and I ﬁnd that the manner in which
notiﬁcations appear, ring, or whichever ﬂavor they take are clearly similar to a ringing
phone or a person requesting their attention. Therefore, I consider receiving a notiﬁcation
about an email a summons. Of course, Schegloﬀ intended summons to be speciﬁcally for
conversational openings, which at the time of his original studies was always true of a ringing
telephone. In present phone usage, there exists the possibility of a ringing telephone to be
from an automated system, which certainly has many features of a summons in the way it
grabs attention and beckons to answer it, but lacks one key feature – it is not meant to
start a conversation. This rather rare feature of summons over the phone, is prevalent and
extremely relevant to summons over email. This prevalence is due to the large amount of
noise that exists on the email channel and the indiscriminate nature that email clients issue
notiﬁcaitons for email messages. Therefore, in the case of summons of email, there exists
the nearly guaranteed possibility of receiving what I am terming a false summons. Which
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 7. Conclusions and Future Work 108
represents one of the idiosyncrasies of email that gives rise to anxiety over missing a true
summons.
To be more explicit about what I do not consider a summons, and how some conversations
may lack it, I must outline aspects of email use that are similar to a summons but lack key
features. I do not consider the unread count a summons, it is an indicator of the number
of unread messages and does not contain the same draw or speciﬁcity that is required for a
summons. The unread count is a ﬁgure against a background, if one is used to a high unread
mail count it is not indicative in any precise way. It does not contain enough information to
draw a user into a speciﬁc conversation. However, I imagine if the user notices a shift in the
unread count it becomes more distinct against the background, and the user may be able
to reason (much like a ringing phone) about who the email might be from. This, in part,
is precisely what inbox management techniques like ‘Inbox Zero’ seek to do, make any shift
in the unread count distinct against the background of email. Contrast this with a ringing
phone, that may lack information about the summoner, it is still speciﬁcally from someone
requesting to begin a conversation with the answerer. Furthermore, I do not consider a
single unread message in one’s inbox a summons to a conversation, while it certainly shares
some aspects with a summons, it simply does not satisfy the condition of being an ‘attention
getting mechanism.’ The only thing that I consider a summons within the email channel is
thenotiﬁcationthatyouhavereceivedanemailfromaspeciﬁcpersontobeginaconversation.
The fact that an email conversation can occur without a summons, is another signiﬁcant
diﬀerence from initiating a conversation face-to-face or over the phone. When the indiscrim-
inate nature of issuing a summons within the email client is coupled with the large amount
of noise that we found in the email channel, a reason for my participants’ anxiety around
missing an email and their reasons for maintaining engagement with email becomes quite
evident. There is no guarantee that a summons will be issued for a conversation in email,
or that you will receive a summons if it is issued.
7.3.2 Predisposition, Preconditions, and Mitigating Behaviors
In my analysis I separated relevant aspects of email use into several sets of features. These
sets of features helped me to isolate and compare what factors played which roles in diﬀerent
phenomenon, and speciﬁcally how they impacted a speciﬁc research question. These roughly
group into three sets of features:
• predispositions, which includes aspects measured by the Attentional Networks tests
(Alerting, Orienting, and Executive Control), as well as, situational aspects (how many
projects the participant is involved in, upcoming deadlines, etc.);
• preconditions, including aspects such as number of unread messages, number of
messages replied to, diversity of senders, reasons for initiating the session, or if this
was an interruption.
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 7. Conclusions and Future Work 109
• mitigating behaviors, including reading habits, ﬁling habits, or strategies.
While I believe that this framework did fulﬁll my goal of isolating aspects of individuals,
their email use, and measuring their impact, for email use at least an additional facet around
social activities needs to be added. The social facet of email use had a large role, we do not
use computers in a vacuum and this has to be taken into account.
7.3.3 Email as a Metacontextual Tool
The majority of PIM tools, especially email, are fundamentally diﬀerent from more primary,
focused interfaces like document based applications (Word, Excel, etc.). PIM tools are
meta-contextual, in that they interleave multiple facets or contexts of a users life and work.
Whereas, anapplicationsuchasWordtypicallyinvolvesworkingonadocumentthatbelongs
to a single context. This adds to emails ability to pull its users down a path of unintended
interactions, and is a feature of computer applications that should make their designers
increasingly aware of aiding their users in managing their attention.
7.4 Recommendations
Over the course of this research I have come to believe that while there are certainly several
features that can be tweaked or implemented to improve email, the fundamental problems
are around the status, etiquette, and practices in email.
There are several features, some of which have recently been deployed by either Apple or
Google, that may alleviate a portion of diﬀerent problems experienced in email. Recognizing
that there are diﬀerent types of emails, as noted in my analysis of the diﬀerent requests
for attention, is certainly being done by Google right now. Their diﬀerent categories can
roughly be mapped to the diﬀerent levels of attention. Further research needs to be done
as to whether a further level of speciﬁcity can be achieved (and accepted) by email users in
terms of which emails require a reply. Another recommendation that I have is to provide
diﬀerent paths of interaction into email, Apple (among some other email clients) has also
recognized this insofar as replying to an individual message and given the ability to reply
directly in a notiﬁcation in order to avoid going into the inbox. Perhaps this could go further
into having diﬀerent modes for pruning, composing, replying, etc. There is certainly some
research and functionality being developed and deployed around making notiﬁcations for
speciﬁc emails more prominent. Rector and Hailpern [2014] developed an additional layer
of notiﬁcation for important emails, and Apple has created a VIP inbox, as well as the
ability to mark that you are expecting a reply to a message that you are sending. However,
I believe that these features will only impact email in small ways. With all of the major
changes experienced over the decades in the transition from land phones to mobile phones,
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 7. Conclusions and Future Work 110
the essential experience and practice of talking on a phone has remain mostly static, the
largest change being the removal of the identiﬁcation work in the opening sequence due to
the advent of caller id.
Email is ﬁrst and foremost a communication medium, this means that many activities hap-
pen through email. This sometime leads to the allure that because an activity happens
on email it is an email activity (or the primary email activity) and that email should be
more speciﬁcally molded to that activity. So far all of these eﬀorts have failed. Instead,
it is emails ﬂexibility, lack of focus, and simplicity that leads to its success. Email is not
restrictive in what an author can put into an email, nor should it be. Users of email use
it to communicate about any and all activities or topics, imposing restrictions onto email
will only hamper the application and frustrate its users. Instead any new features should be
around making communication easier, not restricting or focusing around a type of activity
that email contains.
When I set out to study email use, I endeavored to ﬁnd a way to assist email users to better
direct their attention within email. Certainly the way that notiﬁcations are issued is not
good enough, and this likely can be improved through analyzing usage patterns and applying
either machine learning or heuristics to message display. It will be diﬃcult to perfect the
issuing of notiﬁcations, but easy to at least improve upon them. However, email’s draw
on our attention comes more from the pressures of our relationships than it does from the
application itself. How else can you explain the engagement or anxiety with email that its
users feel even when they are away from the computer. The problem with email is us, not the
application. Therefore I tend to believe that a change in etiquette or practice is more likely
to alleviate the woes of email than changes in the application itself. The email interface, by
itself, can only moderately reduce the anxiety around feeling that one needs to immediately
respond to prompt emails to positively project their professionalism.
7.5 Implications
In this dissertation I have established that the participants in my study did in fact get lost in
email with fair frequency. They are anxious about missing email because email clients do not
properly support aspects of conversations, particularly Summons-Answer sequences. This
leads to conversations that can occur without summons, as well as becoming cumbersome
as they must be re-initiated at each turn. Furthermore assumptions around the importance
of triage and email management need to be re-examined, as my work suggests that the
problems around triage may not be as widespread as previously assumed. The implications
of my ﬁndings still need to be veriﬁed with a wider population, it very well may be that the
particular behaviors of my population were diﬀerent and this impacted my conclusions.
Benjamin V. Hanrahan Chapter 7. Conclusions and Future Work 111
7.6 Future work
There are several areas that require further research based on this work.
First, I have found some preliminary evidence of individual diﬀerences, however, as the me-
chanical aspects of notiﬁcations were not the primary mechanism for getting lost or coming
to be in a longer session of usage, ANT did not give any meaningful results. Perhaps, indi-
vidual diﬀerences in terms of the perception of the importance of email, the desire to project
professionalism, or some more social factor is more appropriate to detect the individual
diﬀerences that were suggested in my ﬁndings.
Second, while relationships certainly play a signiﬁcant role in email use, their nature is not
fully uncovered by my research. Investigation into the types of relationships that email
supports and how these translate outside of email is needed. Additionally, I would like to
investigate how emails to or from familiar versus unfamiliar people diﬀer.
Third, a better understanding of how conversations unfold through email is necessary to
determine what improvements can be made. Particularly, an analysis of how users interleave
conversation pairs [Sacks et al., 1992, p. 4] in email exchanges, each email often seems to
containmultiple‘halves’oftheseunits. Thisrepresentsapotentiallylargediﬀerencebetween
phone or face-to-face conversations and may be another source of confusion in email.
Lastly, do users also get lost in other types of social media (e.g. Twitter, Facebook). If so,
do users get lost in similar ways to email?
Furthermore, additionalresearchisneededintohowtheanxietyoverimmediatelyresponding
to an email is reciprocated by the original sender. Are email users putting an undue burden
on themselves, or is their perception correct?

Title of the Project: Effect of Social Proximity on Email Triage Decision Time
Principal Investigator:  Dr. Tonya Smith-Jackson
Co-Investigators:       Ben Hanrahan
        
I. The Purpose of this Research/Project
The purpose of conducting this study is to determine the effect and importance of situating an 
email message based on the social proximity of the sender to the recipient.  This information will 
help to provide a better understanding of how knowledge of the social context of an individual 
email message effects the ability of an individual to make judgements about email messages.  
NOTE:  This project is an evaluation of the impact of sociality on information decisions 
and not of your performance as an individual.
II. Procedures
If you choose to participate in the evaluation activities, we will ask you to sign one informed 
consent document (this document).  You will keep a copy for yourself.  
Preparatory Questionnaire:  At this stage you will be given the informed consent form to read 
over before ﬁlling out a preparatory questionnaire, the purpose of this questionnaire will be to 
gather sample data about your social map and email usage.  The completion of this questionnaire 
is assumed to be the implicit giving of informed consent.
Experiment Session: During this stage you will again be given the informed consent to read 
over and ask any questions that you may have, if you continue to give your informed consent 
then you will sign the form and the experiment will start.  The experiment will last around 20-30 
minutes and will compromise reading emails while wearing an eye tracker and being observed 
by the researcher.
Post Questionnaire: After completing the experiment a short questionnaire will be given to 
determine additional information about your email usage.
All data from this project will be analyzed and used for evaluation and to determine the effect of 
sociality on information decisions.  Our goal is to more fully understand the role of sociality in 
information decisions that may help us to develop future tools or principles.  Any information 
provided by you will be conﬁdential.
III. Risks 
Risks to you for participating in this study are minimal.   We will make every effort to avoid 
interfering with your daily schedule, and will stick to the agreed-upon time schedule.   Actual 
participation in this evaluation is not likely to cause any harm.
IV. Beneﬁts of the Project  
You will probably not gain any direct benefits as a result of your evaluation activities.  We will also 
provide information to you if you desire to be kept informed about future projects.  
V. Conﬁdentiality
We assure conﬁdentiality to all participants, and any data collected will be completely 
conﬁdential. A code number will be assigned to each participant’s questionnaires and 
observations and only this number will be associated with the data. A master list with a 
participant’s name and contact email will be kept separately from the data in a private and locked 
location.
VI. Compensation 
There is no monetary compensation for participation in the evaluation activities.  
VII. Freedom to Withdraw
Participation in the evaluation is voluntary and the decision about whether you wish to 
participate is strictly your own. You may discontinue participation at any time without penalty or 
loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. Withdrawal from the evaluation activities 
will not result in any adverse effects.

I. The Purpose of this Research/Project
This experiment is meant to provide insights into the day-to-day email practices of users.  This is 
an exploratory study that will inform both future studies and the design of future enhancements 
to email.  NOTE:  This project is an investigation of existing email practices and not an 
evaluation of your performance as an individual.
II. Procedures
If you choose to participate in the evaluation activities, we will ask you to sign one informed 
consent document (this document).  You will keep a copy for yourself.  
Pre Questionnaire: A short (~15 minutes) questionnaire will be administered over email to 
gather details about your email practices and preferences.
Observational Stage: Before this stage begins you will again be given the informed consent to 
read over and ask any questions that you may have, if you continue to give your informed 
consent then you will sign the form and the observation will start.  You will sign into our web 
application and grant us privileges to log your email activity (note: we will use the OAuth 
protocol so that we do not store your log in information and you can shut our access off at 
anytime).  The email logging will only involve the headers of the email (sender, subject, and 
metadata) not the actual content (attachments or body) and you will be able given the chance to 
delete any sensitive emails before analysis begins.
Interview Session:  You may be asked to participate in a short interview session either over 
Skype or in person.
Any information provided by you will be conﬁdential.
III. Risks 
Risks to you for participating in this study are minimal.   We will make every effort to avoid 
interfering with your daily schedule, and will stick to the agreed-upon time schedule.   Actual 
participation in this evaluation is not likely to cause any harm.  In the case that a sensitive email is 
received or sent you will have the ability to delete this email without the assistance of the 
experiment administrators.
IV. Beneﬁts of the Project  
A potential beneﬁt to you is, if you request it, is a summary of your email habits.  We will also 
provide information to you if you desire to be kept informed about future projects.
V. Conﬁdentiality
We assure conﬁdentiality to all participants, and any data collected will be completely 
conﬁdential. A code number will be assigned to each participant’s questionnaires and 
observations and only this number will be associated with the data. A master list with a 
participant’s name and contact email will be kept separately from the data in a private and locked 
location with no way to pair it back to the code for that participant’s data.
VI. Compensation 
There is no monetary compensation for participation in the evaluation activities.  
VII. Freedom to Withdraw
Participation in the evaluation is voluntary and the decision about whether you wish to 
participate is strictly your own. You may discontinue participation at any time without penalty or 
loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. Withdrawal from the evaluation activities 
will not result in any adverse effects.

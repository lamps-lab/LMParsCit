EXPLORING ANALOGIES BETWEEN GRANULAR MATERIALS AND
FLUIDS
Isabel Margarita Figueroa Amenábar, PhD
University of Pittsburgh, 2009
The direct application of fluid-system approaches to particles oftentimes leads to spectacular
failures; e.g. shaking mixes miscible fluids, while it can result in extreme segregation of par-
ticles. Nevertheless, much can be learned through analogies between these disparate systems
and here we adapt concepts from fluid behavior and explore their application in industrially-
relevant particle processes—such as mixing/segregation, heat transfer and flowability.
Adhesion is commonly found in operations involving fine powders and strongly impacts
mixing/segregation of these materials. We develop both a Particle Dynamics (PD) model
capable of simulating dry adhesive interactions as well as a characterization tool—the van
der Waals Granular Bond Number. Using these tools we predict the asymptotic state of
materials in a mixing drum and subsequently test these predictions.
Beyond predicting the asymptotic state of a system, the next natural step is to explore
controlling that state. With this purpose, we propose the addition of “helper” particles to
either promote mixing or segregation. These amphiphilic helper particles—also called Janus
particles—act as bridges between the base particles, alternatively promoting mixing in a
system that would otherwise segregate (surfactant helpers) or separating a specific kind of
particle from a mixture (extractant helpers). Again, predictions are made and then tested
against results obtained by simulation.

The presence of adhesive forces in granular materials can also affect the flowability of a
granular material. Flow aids are frequently added to dry cohesive powders to improve their
flow properties/handling, but are identified purely on an ad hoc basis industrially. Using our
PD model and characterization tools, flow aids are, instead, rationally designed.
Finally, we study heat transfer within granular materials. Specifically, we examine the
conditions necessary to achieve conduction-dominated versus convection-dominated heat
transfer. Interestingly, when conduction is the dominant mechanism, increasing the mixing
rate seems to have a positive impact on the heating rate, while under convection-dominated
conditions the opposite is often true. Dimensionless numbers are used to correlate the results
and a surprising degree of similarity is found when compared to analogous fluid correlations.
Keywords: granular materials, mixing, segregation, adhesion, flowability, heat transfer
mechanisms.

thus mixing takes place at a very low rate. In contrast, for less than half filled

1.0 INTRODUCTION
Processing and handling of granular materials is a crucial operation in a wide variety of
industries (cosmetics, powder metallurgy, abrasives, manufacture of solid rocket propellants,
solid state combustion ceramics, etc.): approximately one half of the products and more
than three quarters of the raw materials used in chemical industries are in granular form
[1]. A better understanding of the phenomena governing their behavior could dramatically
change the analysis and design of industrial operations such as packing, tableting, conveying,
crushing, granulating, separation, coating, drying, multiphase reactions, fluidization, storage
[2]. For example, mixing of powders is critical in industries such as pharmaceutical [3] and
food [4]. Moreover, operations like the calcing of minerals and the drying of fruits or grains
involve two or more simultaneous transport processes—transfer of heat within the granular
materials, mass transfer, chemical reactions, mixing [5].
Despite the fact that granular materials have been the focus of attention in the last several
decades, a fundamental understanding of their behavior has not been reached. No universal
set of equations are capable to describe them. When applicable, the continuum approach
is the simplest method of description and consists of a set of governing partial differential
equations that uses effective properties of the material instead of the absolute values (that
apply for individual components). The continuum hypothesis is applied at large scales where
the ‘control volume’ contains a large enough number of microscopic constituents for the
macroscopic properties to be continuous. Effective properties not only can enable the use of
the fundamental transport equations, but also introduces the use of dimensionless numbers—
and their correlations—to compare, scale and estimate these phenomena in different systems.
1
However, because of the fluctuations in the inter-particle force network and the nonlinear
nature of the contact interactions, the applicability of the continuum approach cannot be
assured [6].
Granular materials can be considered ‘complex systems’. A complex system is one whose
global behavior cannot be determined by studying the many units and interactions that
conform it individually; instead, they need to be studied collectively (e.g., particle self-
organization in segregating patterns [7, 8]). The fact that the intuition we have gained from
our knowledge of fluids oftentimes lead us to incorrect guesses does not prevent us from
using techniques and strategies originally developed for continuum media to study granular
materials. Perhaps the most obvious and successful example is the use of kinetic theory.
In gas-kinetic theory, molecules are assumed to move randomly at speeds that depend on
the gas temperature. The kinetic theory approach for granular materials is based on the
analogy between the molecules in a gas and the grains conforming a powder. When the flow
is fast enough, the velocity of the particles can be approximated by a continuos distribution
[9, 10]. Variations of each particles’s velocity from the average are related to the ‘granular
temperature’ [10] because they reflect the kinetic energy of the flow. This theory have been
used to estimate thermal conductivity [11, 12], viscosity [13], self-diffusivity [12], and develop
equations of state [14].
Mixing two dissimilar materials is not a trivial operation: segregation can exist when
particles differ in any physical property. Segregation is a major problem in industries that
rely on the creation of granular mixtures. In the pharmaceutical industry, for example, a
batch that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars can be rejected if the composition of as
few as five tablets do not meet the FDA requirements [15]. Moreover, investing more and
more energy in the process may have a counterintuitive result: more energy could lead to
more segregation [16, 17]. A substantial amount of the work in this field has been devoted
to find strategies to avoid segregation rather than understand its causes [18]. Reducing
or increasing the particle size, modifying the handling/operating equipment are common
practices to mitigate segregation. Adding a small amount of liquid can help by reducing the
relative movement of particles through the introduction of capillary cohesive forces between
particles. Cohesion can also exist in dry granular materials. If the particle size is relatively
2
small, van der Waals interactions may prevail and govern the granular flow. In Chapter
3, we will aim to understand and predict when a granular material of this kind mixes or
segregates. In the following chapter, we will propose a strategy to control this asymptotic
state based on adding mixing/segregating “helper” particles (Chapter 4).
The angle of repose (AOR) of a granular material is the maximum stable slope that a
pile can have before the material starts sliding. A granular material whose surface angle is
lower than the material’s AOR behave as a solid: there is no relative movement of grains
even when the gravitational force exerts a stress on its surface. Conversely, if the surface
angle of the pile is a few degrees above the angle of repose, particles on the surface start to
flow [19]. The AOR seems to determine the transition from one behavior to the other and
also indicates the degree of cohesiveness of the material. In general, a more ‘flowable’ (less
cohesive) powder will exhibit a lower surface slope and a less ‘flowable’ material, a steeper
slope. Our aim in Chapter 5 is to engineer aid particles capable of manipulating the degree
of “flowability” of the material, i.e. change its repose angle.
Industrially, powders can be mixed not only to create a granular mixture but also to favor
transport of heat or mass or to achieve faster kinetics of a multiphase chemical reaction, as is
commonly done with fluids. Heat transfer in fluidized bed [20, 21, 22, 23, 24], dryers [25, 26,
27, 28], rotary reactors and kilns [29, 30, 31], packed beds [32, 33, 34] have extensively been
studied to understand mechanisms and to obtain estimates of heat transfer coefficients. The
magnitude of the heat exchanged depends on the thermo-physical properties of the particles
and the walls, the interstitial fluid, the shape of the particles and the contact time [35], among
other variables. Depending on the process and material variables, heat transfer between
heated surfaces and particles in motion may be dominated by contact conductance. This
process constitutes one of the basic mechanisms of heat transfer in particulate systems [36].
In Chapter 6, we focus on the problem of heat transfer encountered in a rotating tumbler
when the granular material is heated from the walls. Our goal is to understand the role of
advection in the overall heating process.
The lack of a comprehensive theory has promoted the advance of numerical simulations
in the field of granular materials. A big part of the work presented in the following chapters
was carried out using a simulation methodology we call Particle Dynamics (PD). PD is a
3
Molecular Dynamics based simulation technique that (in the simplest case) considers purely
mechanical interactions between the grains that form the granular material. The motion of
each of the particles or grains is governed by Newton’s law and the key of this methodology
is the calculation of the appropriate inter-particle forces. The main drawback of PD is
that is computationally expensive: the estimated maximum number of particles that can be
simulated is 104 [37] while a typical industrial device has at least 109 particles [38]. Therefore,
the real challenge when using PD is to design meaningful sets of computational experiments
to develop useful models and predicting tools.
This dissertation is organized in the following manner. Chapter 2 lays the background on
the simulation methodology and fundamentals about mixing and segregation. Chapter 3 de-
scribes the use of scaling arguments to build phase diagrams to predict the mixed/segregated
asymptotic state of binary mixture of dry-cohesive (also called in this document, ‘adhesive’)
granular materials. The following chapter proposes a novel strategy to control this asymp-
totic state by using of mixing/segregating aids. These aids—also called ‘Janus particles’—
can act as surfactants promoting mixing of two phases that are otherwise immiscible, or as
extractants to recover one component from a mixture. In Chapter 5, we explore the use of
aid-particles to control the flowability of granular materials. In liquids, better mixing usually
means larger heat transport coefficient. Chapter 6 studies how mixing affects heating rates
in granular materials. Finally, Chapter 7 discusses the outlook of this work.

2.0 BACKGROUND
2.1 PARTICLE DYNAMICS
Particle Dynamics (PD) has emerged as a successful Discrete Element Method (DEM) sim-
ulation technique for modeling granular flows [39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50,
51, 52] giving insight to such diverse phenomena as force transmission [53], agglomerate for-
mation and breakage [54] and segregation of cohesionless materials [55]. In PD, the global
flow of the granular material is determined by the time evolution of the trajectory of each
individual particle governed by Newton’s second law of motion. The equations that describe
the particle motion are:
Linear Motion:
mp
d~vp
dt
= −mp~g + ~Fn + ~Ft (2.1)
Angular Motion:
Ip
d~ωp
dt
= ~R× ~Ft (2.2)
where mp is the particle mass, Ip is its moment of inertia, R is its radius and ~Fn and ~Ft are
the inter-particle forces—normal and tangential, respectively—acting on the particle (See
Figure 1). Modeling the contact mechanics of the particle interactions is the core of PD and
can be accomplished using two different approaches. The first uses a ‘hard sphere’ model
[56] (also known as ‘event driven’ simulation) and assumes that all collisions are binary and
take an infinitely short time. The velocities of the two colliding particles are then updated
by using a restitution coefficient. The second approach, the ‘soft particle model’ [57], is
the one that is used in this work and is capable of modeling multiple particle long-lasting
collisions. This technique is more appropriate for slow, more dense flows. Its main drawback
5
is that, as the force models can be dramatically more complex, the simulations become more
computationally expensive. While a variety of force models may be used [58, 59, 50, 51],
in this work and for adhesionless systems, the normal interactions are computed from an
elastic-plastic model [60]. For elastic contacts, or elastic-plastic contacts at early stages, the
normal force, F en is calculated as:
F en = k
e
nη
3/2, (2.3)
where η is the overlapping between particles given by η = Sij − (Ri + Rj) (Ri, Rj are the
particle i and j radii respectively. The elastic normal contact stiffness ken is related to the
mechanical properties (Young’s modulus, Ei, and Poisson ratio, νi) by [61]:

respectively. After the normal force reaches the yield point [62], plastic deformation occurs
and the plastic normal force (F pn) is calculated using:
Fn = Fy + k

n(η − ηy). (2.7)
In this expression, ηy is the overlapping at the point of yield, k
p
y is the plastic normal stiffness,
which is related to the yield force by kpn = (2/3)(Fy/ηy), and Fy is the normal force between
the particles when the yield stress is reached. If the contact unloading starts before the yield
point is reached, particles bounce back with no energy dissipation according to equation 2.4
and 2.3. Unloading after the yield limit is given by
F pn = Fnmax − ken

The tangential or frictional force is derived from Walton and Braun [51, 63]. The tan-
gential force acting at a particle-particle contact, Ft, is updated by
Ft = Ftold − kt∆δ, (2.10)
where Ftold is the tangential force at the previous time step, and ∆δ is the displacement
during the present time-step that is calculated from the component of velocity tangent to
the contact surface, vt (that is ∆δ = vt∆t where ∆t is the time-step). The frictional stiffness,
kt, depends on two history terms and is given by the non-linear expressions
kt = kto

where Ft
∗ is the tangential force value at the load reverse point. The first expression is
used when the direction of the incremental change in the tangent force would result in an
increase in the total Ft and the second corresponds to a decrease in Ft. This model is capable
of mimic energy dissipation by micro-slip at the edge of the contact and sliding friction as
described by Amoton’s rule Ft ≤ µFn. The value γ is a constant which is typically set to
(1/3) in agreement with Mindlin [64] and kto is the initial tangential stiffness and is related
to the Hertzian normal stiffness by
kto =
kn(1 − ν)
1 − ν/2 . (2.13)
2.1.1 Adhesive forces
As we mentioned before, we will be studying fine granular materials where adhesive forces
caused by electrostatic interactions are predominant. To the best of our knowledge, none
8
of the work focussed on modeling dry-adhesive interactions has aimed to study mixing and
segregation. In this section, we describe different approaches that have been taken to model
these kind of interactions in a variety of applications.
Much of the computational work focussed on dry-adhesive granular materials estimates
the particle-particle interaction as a constant value [65] or a square-well potential [66]. The
work of Alexander et al. [67] studies the avalanches of free-flow, wet-cohesive, and dry-
cohesive powders and report how the latter present a different avalanching dynamics with
respect to their wet counterparts: they present dilation, aperiodic avalanche frequencies and
variable avalanches size. Their modeling work approximates the cohesive force to a constant
value that can be tuned to agree with their experimental observations. The same approach in
a different model was used by Gilbertson and Eames [68]. Interested in studying the effect of
cohesion in fluidized beds of small particle sizes (∼ 4-6 [µ m]), they used an increased value of
stress between particles to model the effect of cohesion. Their results can reasonably predict
the dynamics of these particle flows when cohesion is weak compared to drag or friction
forces. Rhodes [69] used a similar strategy to model fluidized beds by DEM. The cohesive
forces were adjusted to pin-point the region of onset of Geldart’s [70] cohesive behavior, and
focussed on how the flow changes by varying the particle size and density.
Weber and coworkers [66] also studied cohesive fluidized bed by DEM simulations. Their
approach attempts to physically relate the square-well model with the Hamaker constant.
They observed that at lower solids fractions, the presence of cohesive forces has little impact
on the stress components. Rognon et al. [71] investigate the rheology (friction and dilation
of the bed) of adhesive material by relating the cohesive force to a granular bond number,
finding that increasing the cohesion of the material leads to its expansion. For high cohesion
values, they observed the growth of heterogeneities (large voids separating dense granular
areas), and an increase in the contact force anisotropy. Brewster et al. [72] chose a Gaussian
well to simulate cohesive forces in an inclined flow. Using this model, they conclude that
for cohesive materials the Bagnold scaling relation (the shear stress is proportional to the
square of the rate of strain tensor and that the density is constant throughout the material)
does not apply.
9
The main advantage of these formulations lies in their simplicity, in lower computational
requirements and in capability to simulate larger (3D) systems in shorter computation times,
etc; however, their parameters (for example, depth and width of the well) lack rigorous
physical meaning and cannot predict the flow behavior of these materials from first principles.
A notable exception is the work done by Severson [73] et al., who used DEM to model a
mechanical damping device based on micro or nano powder. Their model is based on the JKR
theory and it is capable of mimicking some characteristic phenomena of adhesive contact as
‘peeling failure’ and ‘stretching contacts’. In the remainder of in this section, we describe
the details of our computational model for dry-adhesive interactions. Based on the work of
Johnson et al . [74] (i.e., JKR model), it models adhesive elastic spheres and assumes that the
adhesion between particles results only in a change of surface energy over the contact areas;
therefore, the attractive forces are of infinitely short range. The contact area (determined
by the contact radius, a1) predicted by this model is larger than that predicted under the
condition of no adhesion (contact radius, a0), as is shown in Figure 2, and results in an
infinite tensile stress at the perimeter. This model leads to a finite negative load, i.e., pull-
off force, that is required to separate the surfaces, given by Fc = 3πΓR
∗, where Γ is the
surface energy of the particles.
An alternative model developed by Derjaguin et al . (DMT model) [75] instead argues
that the adhesive normal forces should have a finite range outside the contact area. This
model predicts a slightly larger pull-off force of Fc = 4πΓR
∗. Both models are complementary
and apply to different regions of the adhesive solid-solid interactions that can be determined
by a non-dimensional parameter, defined by Tabor [76],
µT =
3
√
R∗Γ2
E∗ǫ30
(2.14)
where ǫ0 is the interatomic equilibrium distance in the Lennard-Jones potential for solid-solid
interactions. The JKR model is most appropriate for large values of the Tabor parameter,
when soft materials with strong short-range adhesion are in elastic contact, while contacts
between stiff materials with weaker attraction are better described by DMT [77].
10

adhesion under a normal load equal to Fn. (b) Stress distribution in the contacting surfaces.
Distribution A is the Hertz stress for Fn = F1 and respective contact area a1. Distribution
B is the actual stress distribution for Fn. Distribution C is the Hertzian distribution for a
contact radius a = a1 (Ref. [74])
11
The JKR model does not specify which short range interaction (forces of van der Waals,
hydrogen bonding, steric forces, coulombic interactions, etc.) is the source of the surface
energy. When van der Waals force are the source of adhesion, the surface energy, also called
thermodynamic work of adhesion, can be obtained from the interaction laws for different
geometries and the conventional Hamaker constant, A. For example: for two surfaces,
Γ = A/24πD20 and for two spheres Γ = A/12D0R
∗. The value to be used as the interfacial
contact separation, D0, is not obvious; however, Israelachvili [78] estimates D0 as 0.16 [nm]
(based on an energy balance) obtaining a remarkable agreement with measured values for a
wide range of solids and liquids.
Savkoor and Briggs [79] addressed the effect of tangential forces on the size of the contact
area and the normal contact stiffness. Thornton and Yin [80] combined the work of Savkoor
and Briggs [79] and Mindlin and Deresiewicz [75] to describe the tangential behavior of
elastic adhesive particles. A model for normal adhesive plastic collisions has been provided
by Thornton and Ning [81]. In the following sections, we review how these theories are
combined to form the force models we use in our PD simulations.
2.1.1.1 Normal impact of adhesive particles Before the yield stress is reached, par-
ticles in contact undergo elastic deformation. The elastic normal stiffness is given by:

The radius of the contact spot, a, is given as:

(2.16)
where Fc is the pull-off force in the JKR model and F1 represents the effective Hertzian force
which would produce the same contact area [54] in the absence of adhesion. F1 is given by
F1 = Fn + 2Fc +
√
4FnFc + 4Fc
2 − F 2t E∗/4G∗ (2.17)
where Ft is the magnitude of the tangential contact force. It should be noted that for
non-adhesive contact (i.e., Γ = 0) equation 2.17 reduces to the elastic non-adhesive solution.
12
When the normal force increases beyond the yield point, plastic deformation occurs.
First, the initial yield state is identified by testing whether the contact radius has reached
the value associated with yield, given in the expression
σy =
2E∗ay

(2.18)
where the subscript y represents the yield point, i.e., σy is the yield stress. Then, the normal
stiffness, kpn, for the subsequent plastic deformation is calculated using the contact stiffness
at the yield point (point b in Figure 3), using
kpn =
3πR∗σy

The normal contact force, Fn, is updated using
Fn = Fnold + ∆Fn = Fnold + kn∆η, (2.20)
both before and after the onset of yield where kn is the corresponding elastic/plastic stiffness
(kn = k
e
n, if a < ay; kn = k
p
n, if a ≥ ay). Beyond the yield point, the adhesive plastic contact
force, Fn, is continuously updated using equations 2.17 to 2.20 for each time step. Although
in this stage the contact is plastic, the corresponding adhesive elastic force, F en , that would
be attained at the present level of deformation also needs to be computed since its maximum
value (point c in Figure 3) will be used in the subsequent unloading calculations. Unloading
of a contact that has not begun to plastically yield is purely elastic, so that equation 2.20
may be used (∆η now takes a negative value). Alternatively, the unloading stage beyond the
yield limit is assumed to be elastic, except that the past plastic deformation has permanently
altered the (local) radius of curvature. The new radius of curvature, R∗p, is given by
R∗p =
R∗F1max
Fmax +
√
4FcF1max − F 2t E∗/4G∗
. (2.21)
When 4FcF1max − F 2t E∗/4G∗ < 0, an exception is made such that R∗p = R
∗F1max
Fnmax
. This case
corresponds to a discontinuity (peeling completion) in the tangential response that will be
explained in the section 2.1.1.2.
13
Because of the change in apparent radius of curvature the post-yield unloading normal
stiffness is changed and is now given by

and here F1U represents the effective Hertzian force for the unloading stage
F1U = Fn + 2FcU ±
√
4FnFcU + 4FcU
2 − F 2t E∗/4G∗ (2.24)
with FcU denoting the modified pull-off force, FcU = 3πΓR
∗p. The positive sign in equation
2.24 becomes negative when the normal force reaches its lowest value, −FcU , at point e in
Figure 3. Note that in a purely normal contact the continuity of equation 2.24 is assured
since the left term becomes zero when Fn = −FcU . The case when Ft 6= 0 is discussed in the
next section. The contact breaks at αnP , where F = −59FcU (point f in Figure 3).
2.1.1.2 Tangential impact of adhesive particles Savkoor and Briggs studied tan-
gential collisions of adhesive spheres. In their analysis, which incorporates the JKR model
into tangential contact mechanics [79], the tangential force primarily affects the behavior of
colliding particles through changes in the contact radius. This effect is most apparent at
the beginning stages of a collision, which corresponds to a “peeling” mechanism. This can
be seen from the previously discussed equation 2.17. As the tangential force increases, the
contact radius is reduced up to a critical value of Ft, given by
Ftpeeling = 4

(2.28)
The subscripts L, U and R in equation 2.28 correspond to loading, unloading and reload-
ing, respectively. The negative sign in 2.27 is only used for the unloading stage. The
load reversal points F ∗t and F
∗∗
t need to be continuously updated as F
∗
t = F
∗
t + µFn and
F ∗∗t = F
∗∗
t + µFn to account for the effect of varying normal force. In the case that the
peeling criterion has not been satisfied, the contact stiffness is calculated setting θ = 1. A
detailed description can be found in Ref. [82]. Adhesion also changes the tangential failure
criterion—sliding. Beyond the peeling limit, a further increase in tangential loading should
(eventually) result in sliding. Savkoor and Briggs suggested that this transition would occur
via immediate reduction of the contact radius to the Hertzian value, a = 3
√
3R∗Fn/4E∗. In
contrast, Thornton and Yin [49] suggested that the contact radius should vary smoothly at
Ftpeeling; therefore, the sliding criteria proposed in that work and used here, ensures a smooth
transition in contact radius as the contact moves from peeling to sliding. The modified anal-
ysis proposed by Thornton yields multiple cases depending on the value of Ft necessary to
reach the ‘peeling failure’.
17
In general, the onset of the ‘peeling failure’ is determined by equation 2.25, and the
‘sliding failure’ is reached when
Ft = µ(Fn + 2Fc). (2.29)
Both criteria, however, coincide when Fn = F
∗ (See Figure 4), where F ∗ is given by
F ∗ = 2Fc
[

− 1
)
+
√
4G∗
µ2E∗

)
]
. (2.30)
This obviously leads to two separate possibilities. When the instantaneous value of Fn is
such that Fn > F
∗, the ‘peeling failure’ is reached earlier than the point where sliding would
occur; thus, beyond that point a standard (non-adhesive) friction response is expected (i.e.,
development of a slip annulus, followed by a ‘sliding failure’—equation 2.29). If Fn < F
∗,
however, the tangential force at the point when the peeling failure criterion is met is greater
than the magnitude of the force that would normally be required for sliding. Therefore, in
this case, the tangential force beyond the peeling failure immediately jumps to the lower,
sliding limit value. In order to achieve the objective of a continuous change in the contact
radius, we must modify the sliding failure criteria slightly to
Ft =



µ(Fn + 2Fc), if Fn ≥ −0.3Fc
µF1[1 − (F1 − Fn)/3F1]3/2, if Fn ≤ −0.3Fc
(2.31)
This modification is required since, for small values of Fn, the contact spot obtained by
strict observation of Eqn. 2.29 would result in a contact spot that included a tensile (as well
as compressive) region despite the fact that peeling had already completed.
18
2.1.1.3 Collision tests Several particle collisions were simulated in order to validate
the results of the adhesive contact mechanics in our code against the results found in the
literature. The model for normal adhesive contact was validated using the work of Thornton
and Ning [81] for elastic and plastic collisions. The force evolution for adhesive elastic
tangential impacts was compared to the results obtained by Thornton and Yin [80]. In
Figure 5, a normal elastic (thin line) and plastic (thick line) impact is compared for two
particles (R = 100 [µm], ρ = 2650 [kg/m3], E=70[GPa], ν = 0.3 , µ = 0.35, σy = 0.3[MPa]
and Γ=0.2[J/m2]). When particles are approaching, the adhesive forces do not come into
play until the surfaces are in contact. In this loading stage, the particles can experience both
a negative (attractive) and posteriorly positive (repulsive) normal force until the compression
work reduces the kinetic energy to zero. During the unloading stage, particles can remain
adhered because of a (negative) normal force at negative values of the approach (i.e., after
contact of a rigid sphere would have ceased). This latter effect is observed due to the fact
that the material at the contact will “stretch” slightly until the pull-off force is reached. In
some cases, the kinetic energy of the particles at the moment of the impact may not be
enough to overcome the work done by the adhesive force and the particles will not separate
during unloading.
Next, the tangential interaction is tested using the same particle properties. Here, we
simulate different collision angles for an impact velocity of ± 0.5 [m/s]. For the plastic case
without (thin line) and with (thick line) adhesion, the force evolution is shown in Figure 6
(Γ = 0.2 [J/m2] for the adhesive case). The discontinuity observed in the curve for higher
impact angles (≥ 30◦), corresponds to the occurrence of the peeling mechanism of failure.
Beyond this point, the tangential force is large enough to cause the system to slide (straight
line in the force curve). For a lower impact angle (15◦), the tangential force is not large
enough to promote angular motion of the particles because the contact never reaches the
peeling limit so the adhesive interaction absorbs all of the torque.
As mentioned, in presence of adhesion, the attractive forces can prevent the particles of
bouncing back. In the case of elastic contacts (Fmax < Fy), no energy is dissipated during a
collision. If the impact velocity of the particles is smaller that the critical “sticking velocity”
the contact force will oscillate continuously and equilibrium will never be never reached.

line) and adhesive (thick line) particles
21
In order to avoid this instability and physically mimic energy dissipation—for example, by
sound—a contact damping term is added as:
damping = c0
E∗
1 − ν2 (2.32)
where c is a constant and ν is the Poisson ratio. Figure 7 shows the normal tangential
and normal force evolution for a system with (continuos line) and without contact damping
(dotted line). The impact velocity is 0.05 [m/s], the particle properties are the same as those
in Figure 6, and the angle of impact for Figure 7b is 45◦. The magnitude of the contact
force progressively decreases with each oscillation until finally reaching equilibrium (contact
forces are equal to zero) and the particles stay stuck to each other.
2.1.2 Thermal Particle Dynamics
The Thermal Particle Dynamics (TPD) simulation technique is based upon traditional PD
but allows particles to exchange heat between each other and/or with walls. The key feature
of TPD is that by incorporating contact conductance theories many simultaneous two-body
interactions may be used to model heat transfer in a system composed of many particles.
Consider particles i and j and their temperatures ‘far from the contact point’ to be Ti and
Tj , respectively. The amount of heat transported per unit time is given by
Qij = Hc (Tj − Ti) (2.33)
where the contact conductance is calculated using Hc = 2kSa (where kS is the thermal
conductivity of the pure solid material and a is the radius of the contact area between
particles i and j). When particle i is in contact with n particles, its rate of change of the
temperature is given by
dTi

∑n
j=1Qij
ρiciVi
. (2.34)
22

(b)

23
In analogy with PD, this description requires that the time-step be chosen such that any
disturbance (in this case a change in a particle’s temperature) does not propagate further
than that particle’s immediate neighbors within one time-step. Mathematically, this criterion
can be shown to be met by choosing a time-step which satisfies
dTi
Tj − Ti
=
Hc∆t
ρiciVi
=
2kSa∆t
ρiciVi
<< 1. (2.35)
While for this work we are considering particles that are largely in lasting contact, this crite-
rion can also be satisfied in the majority of collision-dominated flows, although the amount
of heat transferred between colliding particles under these conditions can be small [83].
More details of the simulation technique can be found in Ref. [84, 85]. Extensions of
TPD to include the effect of stagnant interstitial fluids are straightforward and have also
been explored [86]. Similar approaches have been developed for flowing gas-solid systems
[87, 50, 88, 89, 90, 91].
2.1.3 Method of quaternions
Surfactants are commonly used to enhance the degree of solubility—or mixedness—of immis-
cible liquids. In Chapter 4, we propose to use amphiphilic particles as particulate analogues
of surfactants in order to control the final mixed state of granular systems. As we will show,
bi-face particles that exhibit different surface properties in each of their faces are able to
allow systems to mix when the asymptotic state of the binary system leads to segregation
and vice versa. The specific properties of each of the Janus particle’s faces can be chosen in
order to favor one kind of interaction where they can act as a bridge between two-particles
that would weakly interact otherwise.
To simulate non-symmetric particles it is necessary to know how each of these is rotating
with time. Depending on the angular position, a Janus particle could be interacting with
other beads with either of its faces. In Figure 8, the top and bottom particle collide with
their ‘red’ and ‘yellow’ hemispheres, respectively. Since the collision is not normal (that is,
the relative velocity has a component in the plane perpendicular to the normal vector), the
tangential component of the contact force is non-zero and causes the particles to spin.
24
Figure 8: Non-symmetric particle rotation during a tangential collision.
25
Quaternions have been used to follow particle rotation: Dziugys [92] used quaternions to
model the rotation of spherical and elliptical particles in DEM in processes such as rotary
kilns and graveling grates; in the work of Langston [93], quaternions are used to model
the discharge flow of frictionless particles from a hopper. Meister [94] used quaternions to
simulate the rotation of non-symmetric objects in the space.
The rotation of a rigid object can be followed by determining the relation of a coordinate
system fixed to the body with respect to a stationary coordinate system. Any vector e can be
expressed with respect to the body-fixed coordinate system (eb) or the stationary coordinate
system (es). Both vectors are related by the rotation matrix Ar as follows,
eb = Ar · es (2.36)
where Ar can be defined as
Ar =





(2.37)
where φe, θe and ψe are the Euler angles. Evans [95] proposed a quaternion to describe
the rotational motion, because a vector with three independent components can not provide
equations with no singular points. The basic simulation algorithm is described in the work
of Evans and Murad [96]. A quaternion Q is composed of four scalar quantities as
Q = (q0, q1, q2, q3). (2.38)
Often the last three terms (q1, q2, q3), are considered vector components. The quaternions
satisfy the constraint
q20 + q
2
1 + q
2
2 + q
2
3 = 1, (2.39)
26
and given the Euler angles (θe, ψe,φe) of a specific rotation, the quaternion components can
be calculated from the following set of equations:
q0 = cos

2.2 MIXING AND MIXING MEASURES
2.2.1 Mixing and segregation
Mixing is an operation where a relatively homogeneous substance is obtained from two or
more ingredients, and the required quality of the mixture, or its homogeneity, depends on the
powder mixture use. Industrially, poor mixing causes problems during handling, processing,
transporting, or unit operations where granular materials are involved. Some examples are:
fluctuation in food packages weight, discard of pharmaceutical powders because of variation
of active/inactive ingredient composition, uneven composition of fertilizers, poor mechanical
properties of compacts and abrasives, low conversion rates caused by poor reactant contact
[2, 15]. However, in particle classification, segregation can facilitate the separation of grains.
When a granular mixture of particles with the same physical properties—such as size, density,
shape—is subjected to a mixing process, it asymptotically evolves to a perfect mixture as the
process progress. However, particles composing powder mixtures commonly have different
properties and, in this case, the material may exhibit segregation.
2.2.1.1 Segregation mechanisms Roughly, there are four segregating mechanisms that
have been extensively studied: percolation/sieving, fluidization, convection, and trajectory
segregation (Figure 9), although many more have been identified in the literature [97]. Per-
colation is commonly found in granular materials where there is a difference in particle size.
When the particle mixture flows and particles can rearrange such as happens during stirring,
vibration, pouring, tumbling, the smaller ones can fall down between the large particles and
reach the bottom of the container. Trajectory segregation is based on the distance, or
‘stopping distance’, that a particle can horizontally travel before it lands when it is projected
with a velocity v in a fluid of viscosity µf , as happens at the end of a conveying belt. In the
Stokes law region, this distance is given by S = vρd
2
18µf
, where ρ and d are the particle’s density
and diameter, respectively. According to this equation, a particle twice as large can travel
four times the distance. Segregation by convection [17] corresponds to the rise of large
particles upon vibration. The convective upward movement of particles in the middle region
28
Figure 9: Segregation mechanisms.
29
of a vibrated bed causes all of the particles to rise, and segregation by size results when the
large ones are prevented from returning to the bottom through the thin downward region
close to the container walls. In a gas-fluidized bed, if the velocity is only moderately above
the minimum fluidization velocity, the bed can segregate by fluidization: the ‘flotsam
particles’ [98] (smaller and/or lighter particles) migrate to the upper part of the bed while
the ‘jetsam’ particles (larger and/or heavier) tend to move towards the bottom of the bed.
2.2.1.2 Practices to avoid segregation Much of the research work in this area is aimed
at proposing strategies to avoid or minimize segregation by either modifying the properties
of the materials or controlling the operating conditions of the units that process and handle
the material. Modifying the size distribution (by size reduction or agglomeration) may be
the most effective way to minimize segregation [99, 100, 101], but it is often complicated
and expensive [102]. For example, the mechanical properties of a compressed tablet can be
affected by a change in the primary particle size. It is also possible to find a balance between
size ratio and density difference to avoid segregation [103, 104]. However, reducing the
particle size can also affect the flowability properties of the material [102]. Another method
that can contribute to mitigate segregation is increasing the moisture content [105, 106].
Practically, the operation of industrial devices can be modified to avoid segregation by
understanding the mechanism that cause it in each case. During a filling process (of a silo or
of any storage container), granular material can segregate by trajectory, percolation and/or
fluidization [102]. The first two are related to the formation of a heap, therefore some of the
methods to avoid segregation in this kind of operation are oriented toward avoiding heap
formation, or reducing its size and/or the size of the free-fall height by using different kind
of distributors (that would form several smaller heaps) and inserts (chutes, egg-box inserts,
etc) [102, 107, 108, 109, 110]. Segregation by fluidization appears due to the presence of fine
particles or high free fall heights. The two natural methods to avoid this kind of segregation
are increasing the particle size by granulation or reducing the free fall height [15, 111]. To
discharge a silo, an efficient device is a mass flow discharge hopper [112]. In order to get a
constant flow it is important to maintain a certain amount of material in the hopper. Inserts
of different shapes can be added to avoid the formation of funnel flows [113].
30
A recent study by Shi et al. [114] showed that time modulation of the flow can be used to
limit segregation. The key is to recognize that granular materials have a ‘preferred direction’
where particles tend to segregate and that segregation takes a finite amount of time (tSEG).
The material cannot segregate as long as this ‘preferred direction’ is inverted/perturbed with
a frequency higher than t−1SEG. Practically, this can be achieved by inverting the direction of
the flow in a chute or selectively placing baffles in mixing devices.
2.2.1.3 Segregation studies Most of the practices previously mentioned are qualitative
and/or have been developed empirically. However, in the last few years fundamental research
on granular matter seems to have exploded [38] and studies from a fundamental point of
view have arisen. Khakhar et al. [55] studied radial segregation (core formation) in a
cascading flow. The results of their constitutive model (that requires one fitting parameter,
the dimensionless segregation velocity) agree with their experimental observations in the
segregation velocity and final degree of segregation. They also demonstrated competing
cases of mixing and segregation and how, if mixing occurs fast enough, at a certain ‘optimal
mixing time’ the intermediate state of the material can exhibit a higher mixing degree than
the asymptotic state. The work of Makse and coworkers [8] show how a difference in the
friction angle is enough to create a segregation pattern when the material is poured between
two vertical plates. Particles stop rolling on the heap whenever the local slope is less than the
maximum static angle of repose, then particles of different friction angles stop at different
points in the heap. Another example of self organizing structures is the work by Hill et al. [7].
The patterns observed experimentally are explained by a continuum model that incorporates
collisional diffusion and density-driven segregation. Khakhar [115] studied segregation driven
by density as well as by size in a chute flow. Their theoretical predictions for equilibrium
number density profiles agree with their computations for mixtures of equal sized particles
with different density for all solids volume fractions, and for mixtures of different sized
particles at low volume fractions.
The existence of forces other than ‘hard sphere’ repulsion and friction in a granular flow
can dramatically affect the flow behavior. This was first introduced by Hersey [116] by using
inter-particle forces to mitigate segregation by the concept of ‘ordered mixing’. This requires
31
particles that preferentially interact (by adsorption, surface tension, frictional, electrostatic,
adhesion, etc.) with dissimilar ones to create a mixture that is more homogeneous than a
random one. Practically, most inter-particle interactions are cohesive and can be classified
in two main types: wet (induced by liquid bridges) and dry (caused by inter-particle forces).
Kudrolli [117] et al. studied the effect of the moisture content in the degree of segrega-
tion of a bi-disperse mixture of powders that is poured from a hopper. For small volume
fraction of fluid, they found that segregation was mitigated by viscous and capillary forces
and, when the moisture content was increased, they reported a transition back to a segre-
gated state. Geromichalos [118] identified three different regimes—viscoelastic, gaseous and
intermediate—of the dynamic behavior of wet granular materials, depending on the effect
(enhance mixing/segregation) of incrementing the moisture content in the degree of mixing
of a jar containing glass particles of two different radius. Hsiau [119] also observed that the
degree of mixing can be increased by adding moisture in a vibrating bed. A more general
approach was adopted by Li et al. where the mixing degree of binary mixtures of particles
of different sizes, densities and hydrophobicities is predicted from the physical properties of
the powders. The model is based on dimensionless numbers, (Granular Bond Number Boij)
and their predictions have been compared with experiments.
The case of mixing and segregation of dry adhesive forces remains unexplored. An
exception is the work by Hutton and coworkers [120], they use a magnetic field to control
the inter-particle forces in a mixture of iron and a non-magnetic particles. They describe
phase diagrams as a function of the relative magnitude inter-particle force to the particle
weight and the effective particle size of the clusters formed, to determine regions of ‘increased
ability to mix’.
2.2.2 Mixing measures
The use of the powder mixture determines the quality of mixture standards. Danckwerts
[121] used the term ‘scale of scrutiny’ as the maximum size of the segregating regions that
can cause the mixture to be considered acceptable for its intended use. For a given powder,
its quality of mixture decreases as the scale of scrutiny, with the extreme case where each
32
sample contains only one particle. In this section, some measures that attempt to quantify
the degree of mixture are described, among them Intensity of Segregation (IS), which is the
mixing measure used in this work.
2.2.2.1 Intensity of Segregation The Intensity of Segregation (IS) is essentially the
standard deviation of the concentration calculated at multiple spots in the granular bed, and
is calculated using:
IS = σ =
√
∑N
i=1(C − 〈C〉)2
N − 1 (2.43)
where N is the number of concentration measurements, C is the concentration of the tracer
particles in the designated measurement location, and 〈C〉 is the average concentration of
that type of particle in the entire bed. It should be noted that large values (approaching
0.5 for a equi-volume mixture) of IS correspond to a segregated state while smaller values
denote more mixing.
2.2.2.2 Lacey mixing index The Lacey mixing index is defined as a function of the
variance (σ2) of the composition of the actual mixture, the variance σ2 of the composition
of the corresponding completely segregated mixture (σ2SEG, that is, its upper limit) and the
variance of the perfectly mixed granular material (σ2MIX , lower limit) as:
Lacey mixing index =
σ2SEG − σ2
σ2SEG − σ2MIX
(2.44)
In other words, this index represents the ratio of the degree of mixing achieved to the
maximum mixing possible. A Lacey mixing index equal to 1 corresponds to a perfectly
mixed state, and value of 0 corresponds to complete segregation.
2.2.2.3 Poole mixing index The mixing index defined by Poole is defined as:
Poole mixing index =
σ2
σ2MIX
(2.45)
A value of 1 for the Poole mixing index represents a perfect mixture, and this index increases
as the mixing quality decreases.
33
2.2.3 Poincare sections
The mixing measures described in the previous section aim to describe the mixing degree of
a powder mixture but make no attempt to examine how that mixture is achieved. As we
will examine the role of advective mixing in determining the rate of granular heat transfer in
Chapter 6, it is useful to review methods of studying this mixing mode. In a tumbler mixer,
the particles move relative to each other in the bed even in the simplest case—when the
grains are identical—because of particle advection. Advection in tumblers can be studied in
at least two different ways with the most common methods being [122]: (i) calculation of
the Poincaré sections (stroboscopic maps of the particle trajectories), or (ii) studying blob
deformation. The former method will be used in this work.
In order to isolate the advective effects of a granular we use the model developed by
Khakhar [123] that applies to mixing of non-cohesive identical grains. The utility of this
model to gain understanding about heat transfer mechanisms in granular systems is further
described in Chapter 6; but, in short, by comparing the heat redistribution in simulated
Figure 10: Schematic picture of half-filled rotating tumbler showing the shear layer (grey),
its thickness (ζ) and length (L). The free surface forms a χ angle with the horizontal.
34
rotating tumblers with the advective flow that governs mixing in the two-dimensional non-
heated model described in Ref.[123], we will determine the predominance of advection in the
overall transfer of heat.
The model describes the single phase, incompressible, continuum flow of these grains in
a two-dimensional tumbler of arbitrary shape when it rotates at constant angular velocity
(Ω) in the continuous rolling regime. In this regime, particles below the free surface move
in solid body rotation with radial velocity Ω
√
x2 + y2, while near the free surface particles
move relative to each other in a lens shaped shear region designated as the shear or flowing
layer. The following description is restricted for cases of half filled, convex rotating tumblers
which are symmetric with respect to 180◦ rotations about their centroid. In the shear layer,
particle velocities are given by
v̄x =
L̄
κ
(
1 +
ȳ
ζ̄
)
(2.46)
v̄y = −x̄
(
ȳ
ζ̄
)2
(2.47)
where the shear layer thickness is ζ̄ = ζ̄o[1 − (x̄/L̄)2].
For circular tumblers the mean velocity field is time independent. However, if the angular
velocity is a function of time and/or the tumbler is not rotationally invariant, the flow
becomes time dependent and the parameters of the shear layer need to be function of time.
In particular, the maximum length L, shear layer thickness ζ , and mean velocity u of the
flowing layer will vary as the tumbler rotates.
The variation of the dimensionless shear layer length with time for an elliptical shape is
given by
L̄(t) =
B̄√
B̄2 cos2 ϑ+ sin2 ϑ
(2.48)
with ϑ = (t̄+υ) mod 2π (where υ is the initial angle between the free surface and the major
axis of the ellipse), and B̄ = BE/AE, where AE and BE are the major and minor semi-axes
35
of the ellipse, respectively. For a rectangular shape the free surface length can be calculated
from
L̄(t) =




| cosϑ|
, if ϑ < ϑd or |π − ϑ| < ϑd or ϑ > (2π − ϑd)
B̄
| sinϑ|
, otherwise
(2.49)
with ϑb = tan
−1 B̄. Again, the rescaled parameters of the flow are the aspect ratio B̄ =
BE/AE, where AE and BE are the major and minor semi-axes of the geometry, and the
maximum mid-layer thickness ζ̄o,max = κ. The value of the parameter κ can be obtained
from experimental observations [123], and is typically 5–15 particle diameters. Also, this
experimental work had shown that the maximum mid-layer thickness is linearly dependent
on the shear layer length L, (i.e. ζ̄o/L̄ = κ). In this work we use L̄max = 1, and ζ̄o,max =
κ = 0.15. The Poincaré sections are then obtained by integration in time of the equations
describing the velocity field, both in the shear layer and the solid body rotation region. The
trajectories are computed from
dx̄
dt̄
= v̄x(x̄, ȳ, t̄), (2.50)
dȳ
dt̄
= v̄y(x̄, ȳ, t̄) (2.51)
where v̄x, v̄y is the velocity field described by Eqs. 2.46–2.47. Equations 2.46 and 2.47
represent the Lagrangian description of the convective diffusion equation, neglecting the
diffusion component.

3.0 PREDICTING MIXING AND SEGREGATION OF ADHESIVE
GRANULAR MATERIALS
When the size of particles is very small, the impact of van der Waals forces on their behavior
becomes significant. A better understanding of the impact of this force on processing of fine
particles would be useful to many industries (e.g., pharmaceutical, nuclear reactors, ceramics,
coatings). Tools for the characterization, scaling, and prediction of the behavior of adhesive
granular systems can critically change the analysis and design of industrial operations involv-
ing fine powders. Despite significant advances in the understanding of the impact of other
forms of cohesion on the mixing and segregation of granular materials [124, 118, 117, 125] the
role of adhesion due to van der Waals forces in the mixing/segregation process has not been
extensively studied. In contrast, the impact of this kind of cohesion on the behavior of col-
liding particles/surfaces has long attracted attention from researchers [126, 75, 127, 79, 80].
It is these theories that will form the basis of the simulations presented here. The objective
of this work is to examine the behavior of cohesive elastic-plastic particles and provide char-
acterization tools capable of predicting the asymptotic state of these systems—i.e., whether
than state is more mixed or more segregated than the comparable non-cohesive counterpart.
3.1 THEORY
3.1.1 Granular Bond number
We define the van der Waals Granular Bond number, Bovdw, as an extension of the Granular
Bond Number (Bog) [106, 124], to quantify the impact of adhesive binary interactions on
37
mixing. We assume that adhesiveness is caused by van der Waals interactions. The Bovdw
is calculated as the ratio of the van der Waals force (Fvdw) to other relevant forces in the
system. The latter correspond the gravitational force, and our Bovdw is a function of the
particle weight (W ) such that
Bovdwij =
Fvdw
W
=
2πΓijR
∗
4
3
πg [R3ρ]m
, (3.1)
where Γ is the surface energy of particles, and (R3ρ)m is the smaller of the two particle
masses to represent the fact that the less massive particle’s motion will be dominated by the
more massive particle (i.e., it will behave as a guest). While the choice of the value for Fvdw
in this expression could be made to follow either the JKR or DMT approach, we instead
choose to use a pre-factor of 2 in analogy to the case of cohesive (wet) granular material
studied in Ref. [124]. Note that, in the next section, our analysis will focus on ratios of
Bovdw so that the exact value of this pre-factor is insignificant.
In order to build our simple mixing theory, the values of the Bovdw for each potential
pair of particles, i and j, within the system need to be compared (i.e., for a binary system,
we need to calculate Bovdw11 , Bovdw22 , and Bovdw12 , where 2 is defined as the larger of the
particles, see Fig. 11). Alternatively, in cases where the dominant non-adhesive force has a
non-gravitational origin (e.g., in cases where the shearing forces are larger than gravitational
forces) a similar approach can be used with a different choice of force scaling (see Ref. [128]
for work focused on the shearing of wet granular mixtures).
3.1.2 Phase diagrams
The most convenient use of Bovdw as a predictive tool is to develop phase-space diagrams
so that we may visually identify regions where systems tend to mix/segregate. We find the
boundaries of each of these regions by comparing the magnitudes of the various Bovdwij of
the system. This comparison can be written in dimensionless form as:
ℜ1 =

In order to determine the mixing behavior, we can then locate the boundaries of our mix-
ing/segregation phases in the diagram by analytically identifying where in the parameter
space of size ratio (β), density ratio (α) and surface energy ratio (φ) differing hierarchies of
Bovdwij are observed. Regions in the phase diagrams where the predominant interaction is
the interaction between dissimilar particles (i.e., particles 1-2) lead to a mixed asymptotic
state. When this is not the case, we expect an asymptotic state to exhibit segregation. In
other words, systems where both ℜ1 and ℜ2 are less than one will achieve a mixed asymptotic
state and systems where either ℜ1 or ℜ2 are greater than one will result in a segregated state
(Figure 12).

Regions of the phase space where adhesive interactions enhance (E phase) or mitigate (M
phase) segregation are denoted in Figure 13 as light and dark regions, respectively. Note that
the accuracy of the phase diagram predictions is subjected to the validity of the assumptions
of our theory. These can be summarized as follows. First, only two-particle interactions
exist in our systems; that is, interactions of clustered particles with other single/clustered
particles are taken into account. This assumption may not be valid if the size difference
between particles is significant. Second, systems are “thermalized” and the frequency of
occurrence of each kind of interaction (1-1, 1-2, 2-2) is similar. This means that the flow
in the system is such that each particle can explore all possible interactions to choose its
more favorable asymptotic partners and, that each of these partners can be visited with
comparable frequency. This is most likely to be true for case where the all particles in the
system have similar sizes (β close to 1). Last, the planes where ratios ℜ1 = 1 and ℜ2 = 1
are assumed to determine the boundary between the mixing and segregating spaces. In
other words, our simple theory predicts a discontinuity at these boundaries while . As will
be seen in Section 3.2, both of these assumptions can have negative impact on our results.
Nevertheless, this approach is surprisingly effective in many instances.
3.2 TUMBLER SIMULATIONS
In this section, PD simulations of binary mixtures of particles in rotating tumblers are used
as a testbed for the results shown in Figure 13. Because the proposed theoretical arguments
suggest changes in the asymptotic mixing behavior exhibited by cohesive versus free-flowing
systems, we first examine the results of free-flowing mixing exercises. These results are
then compared to those obtained for van der Waals adhesive materials. Before beginning
a detailed comparison of theory and simulation, we should note several key assumptions of
our approach that are not necessarily consistent with the behavior of real systems. First, we
consider only interactions between two primary particles. Clearly if the cohesive interactions
are strong enough, or size discrepancies are sufficiently large, multi-particle interactions will
become significant. Second, we assume that the system is “thermalized” enough that each
43
particle will have the opportunity to choose its most favorable asymptotic partner. In the
case of each of these assumptions, the absolute magnitude of the cohesive interaction will
play a role in determining how (in)valid the approximation/prediction is; therefore, in the
following sections we vary this absolute magnitude in order to elucidate its role.
The initial conditions correspond to static tumblers with particles segregated by color
in each (left and right) half of the tumbler. These particle arrangements are obtained via a
preliminary simulation whereby particles are aligned on a perturbed hexagonal lattice and
allowed to settle under the influence of gravity. The tumbler is 28 particles in diameter and
4 particles long (and periodic) in the axial direction. The rotation rate corresponds to 5
[rpm], and the simulation is run up to 5–12 revolutions, depending on the time required
to reach its asymptotic state. As we are interested only in kinematics the particle stiffness
used is reduced in order to decrease necessary simulation time (a practice shown to have
essentially no impact on flow kinematics [129]) and the particle diameter is scaled up to 4
[mm] (with corresponding increases in the surface energy to obtain the proper Bovdw range).
The simulation parameters of the base case are as shown in Table 4. The particles of the
tumbler walls are assumed to be have the same material properties of the larger particles in
the system. In order to quantify the degree of mixing, we examine the evolution of the IS
for each system and the prediction given by the phase diagram is compared with the PD
simulation result.
We should note that each point of the phase space to be examined corresponds to a
system that has a fixed value of size ratio (β), density ratio (α) and surface energy ratio (φ).
Therefore, there is some flexibility available for us in choosing the absolute sizes, densities,
and surface energies while still examining the relevant points in phase space. As mentioned
previously, it is important that we carefully choose the degree of adhesion such that cohesive
interactions are not overwhelmed by collisional forces, yet cohesion is small enough that large
particle clusters are not persistent. As such, we will examine two distinct ranges of Bovdw
in the following sections.

3.2.1 PD simulations vs. phase diagram prediction: systems β > 0.5
We start our mixing/segregation studies by simulating cases where the size differences are
not particularly large, i.e., β > 0.5. In these simulations, our results are found to be
somewhat insensitive to cohesion degree so, in this section, we (somewhat arbitrarily) choose
our cohesive scale such that Bovdw12 ∼ 15 and consider this as the base case for adhesion in
latter studies. Table 1 summarizes the Granular Bond Number for the systems treated in
this section and includes the asymptotic value of IS reached in each case (i.e., it is an average
of the final three points in Figures 14, 15 and 16). Case b corresponds to particles with size
differences (β = 0.75), but no density difference. Because of this, the corresponding free-
flowing case segregates as indicated by an Intensity of Segregation value (ISffb) of 0.34 after
14 revolutions. The phase diagram predicts that adhesive forces will mitigate segregation as
the small-large interaction is the strongest. The evolution of the IS both for the free-flowing
and the adhesive case is presented in Figure 16 and depicts how the non-adhesive system
achieves a segregated asymptotic state, while mixing is enhanced by the presence of adhesion
(resulting in an ISb value of 0.25, which is seemingly still decreasing). Next, we examine
cases e and f which correspond to systems where both size and density differ. Specifically,
the smaller particle is also more dense so that dramatic segregation is expected in the free-
45
flowing case. For case e, cohesive interactions between the like smaller particles is dominant,
while in system f the strength of the large-large interaction is biggest. In other words,
strong segregation is expected in all cases, whether cohesive or free-flowing. As can be seen
in Figure 14, after 5 revolutions, all systems are clearly segregated as expected and indicated
by the IS values (ISe = 0.39, ISf = 0.40). Finally, in systems h and i, the smaller particles
are less dense so that segregation by size and density have competing effects. The size effect
promotes the migration of the small (light) particles toward the inner core, whereas the
density effect pushes the light (small) particles toward the periphery. These opposing effects
cancel in the free-flowing case, and the system with no adhesion is mixed after 7 revolutions
(see Figure 15b). For the adhesive cases h and i, our model predicts that their asymptotic
states will depend on the surface energy ratio of the particles. For the case h, where φ = 2.0
the system will segregate, while in case i (where Γ11 = Γ22) the system is expected to mix.
These results may be rationalized as follows. When the smaller particles have a significantly
higher surface energy compared to the other particles present in the system (as in system
h), they tend to form clusters exclusively composed of small particles. As a consequence,
these clusters of particles are large enough to overcome the tendency of individual small
particles to migrate toward the center and the density-based segregation dominates (Figure
15). However, in the case where the surface energies are equal, cluster formation of dissimilar
particles is favored, therefore the mixing tendency of the free-flowing case is not affected by
adhesion. The mixing progress as well as the IS values (after 6 revolutions, ISffhi = 0.19,
ISh = 0.39 and ISi = 0.19) confirm the predictions given by our phase diagrams.
3.2.2 Effects of adhesion in tumbler simulations: systems β = 0.5
As a further test of our predictions, we next examine systems with larger size differences (β =
0.5, highlighted with circles in Figure 13). As expected, however, this tends to emphasize
the fact that we have neglected interactions beyond binary and, as we will see, the absolute
degree of cohesion becomes more significant in these systems. The cases examined here
involve: size segregation only (a and c), which segregates strongly when free-flowing; size
and density segregation that augment each other (d), which yields dramatic segregation in

the free-flowing case; and size and density segregation that compete (g), so that the free-
flowing case is somewhat mixed. First, we examine these systems using the base adhesion
degree described in section 3.2.1. Then, we revisit these systems by running PD simulations
corresponding to the same points in the phase diagrams, now with higher surface energies
(more adhesion). The new systems have been scaled to yield Bovdwij ∼ 30 (more adhesive
case). A listing of all of the Granular Bond Numbers are in Table 2.
In the case of system a, the strongest cohesive interaction is for dissimilar particles (i.e.,
the “mixing” interaction), so we expect that adhesion will increase the extent of mixing.
In Figure 17a, it can be observed that the degree of mixing of system a is higher than the
respective free-flowing case (ISffac = 0.38, ISa = 0.33, for 6 rev.), yet the difference is
somewhat modest in the base case. In contrast, using the more adhesive case (ISma), it
is clear that a considerably larger mixing extent is reached (ISmaa = 0.18). One possible
explanation for the necessity of larger adhesive forces in this case may be the following. Since
our simulations contain equal parts by volume of both species, the larger size difference leads
to a dramatically larger number of small particles. This skews the probability of interactions
between particles such that small-small interactions happen far more frequently. Hence, our
assumption of binary interactions that essentially randomly visit all possibly combinations
becomes less realistic. Increasing the absolute degree of cohesion, however, changes the
“penalty” for choosing the more probable interaction over the more favorable so that we
eventually reach the predicted state. Case c maintains the same mechanical properties as
case a (i.e., β = 0.5 and the densities are the same), but now the smaller particles have
a larger surface energy (φ = 2.0). In this case, the small-small interaction is predominant
and the phase diagram predicts enhanced segregation (Figure 18). Interestingly, the opposite
trend is seen for the base case of adhesion and the cohesive system is significantly more mixed
than the free-flowing case. A possible explanation for this observation is that the interactions
between small particles are so strong that they are rarely present individually, but instead
form persistent clusters. These clusters are comparable in size or perhaps slightly larger
than the large primary particles. Coupling this with the fact that clusters are inherently
less dense (due to voids in the packing) means that these small particle clusters will tend to
migrate outward. In the more adhesive case, we exacerbate this tendency so that the clusters

of small particles are even larger (and still less dense) than the primary large particles so
that we begin to overshoot the somewhat mixed result and move toward a segregated result.
Case d consists of small dense particles that segregate strongly in the free-flowing case.
As with case a, cohesion is expected to increase the degree of mixing, yet the results for the
base case are only marginally different from their free-flowing counterpart (ISffd = 0.35 and
ISd = 0.33). In contrast, increasing the degree of cohesion again leads to a more substantial
difference (Figure 20), leading to IS values below 0.3 (ISmad = 0.28). Finally, in case g
(See Figure 13a and 19), segregation by density and by size lead to competing effects so that
the free-flowing system reaches a low extent of mixing (ISffg=0.19). Once again, for the
base case, we obtain the surprising result that we observe a trend opposite of that predicted.
That is, a basal level of cohesion leads to a slightly more segregated system (ISg = 0.24). As
with the case c, this can likely be explained by the fact that clusters of small particles are
present which skew the natural competition between the density and size segregation such
that density begins to “win”. Increasing the degree of cohesion causes the “penalty” for
these non-favored interactions to be larger (relative to the particle’s weight) such that the
expected increase in mixing is now evident (ISmag = 0.14). Our results suggest the following
general trend. For modest size differences, cluster formation (beyond binary interactions)
may be ignored and our simple theory captures the behavior of cohesive versus free-flowing
systems, regardless of absolute cohesive magnitude. As size differences increase (i.e., β < 0.5)
not only does cluster formation begin to become significant, our assumption that the system
is “thermalized” enough that all potential interactions have roughly the same probability
of occurring randomly begins to cause difficulty. Nevertheless, even in this region of phase
space, simply increasing the magnitude of the cohesive interactions has been effective in the
cases studied here.
3.3 CONCLUSIONS
In this work we examine the effects of adhesion in particle mixing by developing a com-
putational model capable of simulating this kind of interaction. Moreover, we introduce

a characterization tool, Bovdwij , that allows us to construct phase diagrams depicting the
particle/system parameters necessary to obtain mixed and segregated asymptotic results.
These diagrams are based solely on scaling arguments whereby we compare the variety of
potential interactions in the system. Using this model, we have shown that we can accurately
predict mixing/segregation behavior for systems with relatively modest size differences (i.e.,
size ratios larger than 0.5) in simulated tumbler mixers. However, as the size differences
become larger the absolute magnitude of the adhesive forces becomes a significant parame-
ter as the favored interactions now need to compete with multi-particle cluster formation,
as well as the relative decrease in the probability of dissimilar particle interactions. While
the work presented here focuses on tumbler mixer it is entirely possible that other industrial
equipment—such as a fluidized bed—may avoid some of this theoretical pitfalls altogether as
the system is considerably more “thermalized” and binary collisions are much more common
(a similar approach has already been shown to work for wet systems [130]). Nevertheless,
our predicted trends were recovered in all cases studied here simply by increasing the degree
of cohesion, suggesting that this approach may be somewhat robust to device geometry. An
obvious next step in this work is to focus on overcoming the stated assumptions inherent in
our analysis: namely, we need to consider multi-particle interactions, as well as incorporated
particle collision statistics.

4.0 CONTROLLING MIXING AND SEGREGATION OF ADHESIVE
GRANULAR MATERIALS
Mixing two dissimilar materials is not a trivial operation: segregation can exist when par-
ticles differ in any physical property. Segregation is a major problem in industries that
rely on the creation of granular mixtures. In the pharmaceutical industry, for example, a
batch that cost hundred of thousand of dollars can be rejected if the composition of as little
as five tablets do not meet the FDA requirements [15]. Additionally, investing more and
more energy in the process may have a counterintuitive result: more energy could lead to
more segregation [16, 17]. As the particle size decreases, intermolecular interactions start
playing a central role in the bulk behavior of granular materials [131] and can dramatically
impact the mixing/segregation behavior [132]. These kinds of powders are commonly found
in the production of pharmaceuticals, ceramics, detergents, construction, material synthesis
(amongst others) and techniques for rationally controlling their mixing/segregation behav-
ior could contribute to significant cost savings in these industries. Current strategies used
to control mixing and segregation depend on the kind of material, but the most common
practices consist of reducing or increasing the particle size, changing the particle properties
and/or modifying the handling/operating equipment [15, 101, 102, 100]. Recently, however,
manipulating cohesion has been suggested as a means of attaining this control. For instance,
adding a small amount of liquid can help to reduce the relative movement of particles by
introducing capillary cohesive forces between particles. Kudrolli [117] et al. studied the ef-
fect of the moisture content on the degree of segregation of a bidisperse mixture of powders
that is poured from a hopper. For small volume fractions of fluid, they found that segre-
gation was mitigated by viscous and capillary forces and, when the moisture content was
increased, they report a transition back to a segregated state. Geromichalos [118] identified
57
three different regimes—viscoelastic, gaseous and intermediate—of the dynamic behavior of
vibrated wet granular materials, which determine the effect of incrementing the moisture
content on the degree of mixing of a jar containing glass particles of two different radius.
A more general approach was adopted by Li et al. [106, 124] where the mixing degree of
binary mixtures of particles of different sizes, densities and hydrophobicities is predicted
from the physical properties of the powders. They predict the asymptotic state of a wet
particle system based on a dimensionless number, the Granular Bond Number (Boij), and
compare their theoretical predictions with experimental results. An analogous approach for
dry adhesive granular materials is shown in ref. [132], where bond number predictions are
compared with DEM simulated systems dominated by these kind of adhesive interactions.
The results show that as the dry adhesive forces become dominant, the predicted asymp-
totic states become clearer. In this Chapter, we propose a strategy to control mixing of
granular materials by adding “surfactant/extractant aids”. Surfactant particles will be used
to mitigate segregation, whereas extractants have the opposite purpose. Practical applica-
tions of this mixing/segregation strategy can be found, for example, in the pharmaceutical
industry. The use of micron sized particles can favor the dissolution rate of a given active
component in a tablet at the same time that the quality of mixing is critical to the efficacy
of the product. In order to control mixing and segregation, we will first analyze all possi-
ble particle-particle interactions in a given system to a priori determine (from its physical
properties) its mixing/segregation tendency and design the appropriate particles that can
transform this asymptotic state. Our predictions will be compared with Particle Dynamics
(PD) simulations of mixing tumbler containing these materials.
4.1 THEORY
4.1.1 Granular Bond Number for binary systems with Janus beads
In order to analyze systems containing these “helper particles” we need now to extend the
Granular Bond Number concept to interactions that are bridged by Janus particles–i.e.
58
Figure 21: The strength (BoiJj) of a Janus particle interaction is calculated as the weakest
interaction where the bridge can break.
ternary interactions. These interactions are of the form ‘particle i—Janus—particle j’ (iJj),
where i or j are particles of type 1 or 2. If we call A and B the Janus’s hemisphere in contact
with i and j respectively, the Granular Bond number can be expressed as:
Bovdw1J2 = Min
{
Fvdw1A
Min(W1,W2 +WJ)
,
Fvdw2B
Min(W1 +WJ ,W2)
}
. (4.1)
That is, the idea behind the min() operator is that the strength of the Janus-bridged inter-
action between i and j is determined by the weakest bond that links the interaction (See
Figure 21). Expressions for all possible interactions in the system are summarized in Table
3. In general, we expect the concentration of Janus particles to be small enough that the
probability of one Janus particle interacting with another is negligible.
4.1.2 Phase Diagrams
The predicted asymptotic behavior of the binary+Janus systems is calculated in the same
manner as in the purely binary case, that is, by comparing and scaling all existing bonding
forces. Based on the possible interactions in these systems, the strengths of those that pro-
mote mixing (Bo12, Bo1J2 and Bo2J1) are compared with the ones that enhance segregation

(Bo11, Bo22, Bo1J1 and Bo2J2). Janus particles are added either to enhance mixing in an ad-
hesive system that would otherwise tend to segregate or vice-versa. In the first case, we say
that the Janus particles act as a surfactant because they promote mixing of two (granular)
phases that would be ‘immiscible’ otherwise. The latter corresponds to extractant particles
that are used to recover a component from a mixture. More formally, we can express the
functionally of these helper particles as:

Extractant, if max(Boij) = Bo12 and
if max(Boij , BoiJj) ∈ {Bo1J1, Bo2J2}
(4.2)
Next, we aim to determine for which systems (if any) represented in the phase-space diagrams
constructed for the binary systems, it is possible to find surfactants/extractants. Let the
dimensionless properties of a Janus particle be defined analogously to those for the binary
case: αJ = ρJ/ρ2, βJ = RJ/R2, φA =
√
ΓAA/Γ22 and φB =
√
ΓBB/Γ22, corresponding
to the dimensionless size, ratio and surface energy of each of the hemispheres of the Janus
particle, respectively. It is clear that, although our simulation technique can be used to
simulate systems with a wide range physical parameters, the actual values of a particles’s
physical properties that can be found in real applications is limited. For this reason, we have
arbitrarily defined a domain for αJ , βJ , φA and φB as:
0.2 < αJ < 4.0 (4.3)
0.2 < βJ < 4.0
0.0 < φi < 10.0
that limits the availability of functional Janus particles we will use. In Figure 22, the E
region (binary systems that segregate) have been covered with open symbols if it is possible
to use Janus particles to enhance mixing, i.e. there is at least one set of Janus particle’s
properties that satisfies equation 4.3 and the surfactant conditions in equation 4.2. We refer
to this region as the Janus surfactant region. In the M region (containing those cohesive
systems that are expected to mix), closed symbols have been placed only if it is possible
61
to use Janus beads to promote segregation. Again, this means that it is possible to find
particles that are in the set defined by equation 4.3 and satisfies the extractant condition in
equation 4.2. In the same manner, we call this the Janus extractant region. According
to this, for every adhesive system predicted to mix in Figure 22, it is possible to find Janus
beads that would serve as extractant particles. In contrast, only for a reduced space in the
region where segregation of adhesive particles is predicted (E Region in 22) can Janus beads
act as surfactants.
In the section 4.2, we choose binary systems in the surfactant/extractant regions and
attempt to modify their asymtotic state by adding Janus particles.
4.1.3 Selection of Janus Beads properties
Although the dimensionless properties of particles 1 and 2 have been set for each point in
Figure 22, the Janus particle’s properties have not and they must be chosen to favor the
desired final state. For each of the selected systems, Figure 23 shows the domain of densities
and sizes of functional Janus particles (if surfaces energy are chosen appropriately). Two
more degrees of freedom remain to be covered, namely the surface energy ratios of the two
faces of the Janus particles. Once the size and density of the Janus particle have been
selected, again the values for φA and φB are set to satisfy the functional restrictions in
equation 4.2. Figure 24 displays the φA-φB feasible plane for the cases selected in Figure
23 and points out the particle properties we simulate in the next section. Note that the
helper particles with surfactant properties must, in fact, be Janus (i.e., have two different
hemispheres), since no feasible point falls on or near φA=φB. On the contrary, for the
extractant case it is possible to use regular (symmetric) helper particles because φA=φB is
included in the feasibility region.
The selection is based on three criteria:
(i) if the ratio of mixing interactions to the segregation interactions (ℜJ) is defined as:
ℜJ =
max(Bo12, Bo1J2, Bo2J1)
max(Bo11, Bo22, Bo1J1, Bo2J2)
(4.4)
Janus-surfactants are chosen to maximize ℜJ and Janus-extractants to maximize ℜ−1J

(ii) we try to avoid dramatic size differences because they promote cluster formation and
multi-particle interactions, two phenomena which are beyond the scope of our theory
(iii) we choose (when possible) low BoJJ values to avoid the formation of clusters of Janus
particles (i.e., particle “micelles”) that would reduce their activity in the bed
Figure 23 suggests that extractant particles tend to be more massive (higher αJβJ)
while surfactant particles are lighter. An explanation can be as follows. Lets consider a
system where Janus beads are used as surfactants and the interaction aJb is the dominant
interaction. We can choose a, b, A, B such as
BoaJb = min
{
FvdwaA
min(Wa,Wa +WJ)
,
FvdwbB
min(Wb +WJ ,Wb)
}
=
FvdwaA
min(Wa,Wb +WJ)
, (4.5)
in that system there is also a segregating interaction aJa for which,
BoaJa = min
{
FvdwaA
Wa
,
FvdwaB
Wa
}
≥ FvdwaA
min(Wa)
. (4.6)
In order to avoid segregation, the mixing interaction must predominate (BoaJb > BoaJa),
for which we need at least that Wb +WJ < Wa. That lead us to two cases,
if a = 1 ∧ b = 2 αβ3 + αJβ3J > 1
αJ >
1 − αβ3
β3J
if a = 2 ∧ b = 1 αβ3 + αJβ3J > 1
αJ >
αβ3 − 1
β3J
(4.7)
that correspond to the curve that seem to define a extractant/surfactant boundary. The
extractant case can be explained in an analogous manner.
Janus particles used to enhance mixing/segregation act under the same principle as sur-
factants and extractants do to increase the solubility of two immiscible liquid phases or
recover a component from a mixture, that is, using molecule groups (or in this case parti-
cle hemispheres) with different affinity to favor interactions between different components
(extractants) or to generate interactions that prevail over those that promote the mixture
(surfactant). As in the surfactant/extractant case, they can not be removed from the mix-
ture. However, in industrial powders it is common to find components that perform a

4.2 TUMBLER SIMULATIONS
Our focus now is to control mixing of dry adhesive granular material in a rotating tumbler. In
the following results, the initial condition (mixed/segregated) for our simulations is varied
in order to show the effect of the presence of the Janus particles and is chosen based on
the predicted asymptotic state of each system. In cases where the material is initially
segregated, the light (small) and dark (large) particles are located in each—left/right—half
of the tumbler. Initially mixed material is achieved by randomly placing the particles inside
the tumbler and allowing them to settle under gravity. The tumbler diameter is equal to
40 times the particle diameter and the rotation rate is 5[rpm]. We consider base particle
properties (or our base case) those in Table 4. These particle properties are varied according
to the dimensionless values indicated in the phase-space diagrams (α, β, γ) to lead to particle
systems with the required differences in size, density and surface energy.

For each of the cases to be studied, at least two cases are considered: an adhesive case
and a system with Janus particles. All particle properties in the adhesive case are identical
to those of particles 1-2 in the Janus beads system. In some cases, more than one Janus
system is presented to explore the effect of the initial conditions or the number of Janus
particles. The IS values mentioned in the next sections correspond to the average of the
last half revolution presented in the plots. The subscripts wo/J and w/J correspond to the
adhesive case without Janus beads and the system with Janus beads, respectively. MIX
and SEG stand for a initial state of the system.
4.2.1 Extractant particles
In this section, we focus on binary adhesive systems that tend to mix and explore how Janus
particles can be used in these cases to prevent these systems from mixing or to separate
systems that have been already mixed. According to Figure 22, this is the case of systems
a, b and c.
In case a (Figure 25), smaller particles are less dense (α = 0.52, β = 0.85), so that a
free-flowing system would mix (not shown). Similarly, Figure 22 predicts that an adhesive
system would also mix under these conditions, as our results confirm (ISwo/Ja = 0.2). We
attempt to then separate these materials by using Janus particles of a size and density ratio
of αJ = 0.6, βJ = 0.75. The lower density of the Janus particles tends to drive them to
the periphery of the drum. This should facilitate the predominant interaction 1J1. Here
(Figure 25) we show results for both initially segregated as well as initially mixed cases.
For the system that is initially segregated the Janus particles seem to increase the degree of
segregation very slightly; however, if we instead examine the initially mixed case, the Janus
beads appear to be unable to achieve separation. In this case, we must conclude that Janus
beads have little or no effect. This can be understood by virtue of the fact that the dominant
segregation Bond number, Bo1J1 = 18.6, is in fact comparable in magnitude to the largest
mixing Bond number Bo1J2 = Bo2J1 = 14.9, thus the bias expected due to these interactions
is negligible.

73
System b, in contrast, achieves almost a two-fold difference between mixing and segrega-
tion Bond numbers. This system consists of particles with the same densities and a size ratio
of β = 0.75. The free-flowing case again would achieve a mixed state (not shown), as does the
binary adhesive case, as predicted Figure 26. Again comparing both an initially segregated
and initially mixed Janus system yields slightly differing results. Here, the system contains
Janus particles of properties αJ = 3.8, βJ = 0.75, φA = φB = 2.5. The dominant interaction
in the Janus system is the interaction 1J1 and therefore Janus particles are expected to
agglomerate and collect the smaller particles in the inner core (where Janus also would tend
to migrate because of their significantly higher density). In the initially segregated case,
the mixing evolution shown in Figure 26 clearly demonstrates how the rapid drop in the IS
value for the binary adhesive system does not occur when Janus particles are present (i.e.,
the mixing rate is dramatically decreased). Moreover, the asymptotic state reached by the
system with Janus beads is more segregated than that of the binary case. This is confirmed
by the IS values (ISwo/J b = 0.13, ISw/JbSEG = 0.23). Interestingly, in the case of the initially
premixed system, the Janus beads are able to achieve a similar degree of separation over the
time-scale simulated here( ISw/JbMIX = 0.20, ISw/JbSEG = 0.23)
Next, we simulate a system with a size and density ratio of β = 0.5 and α = 1.92
(system c, Figure 27), respectively. All systems in this case are initially mixed. Here the
free-flowing case would result in a strongly segregated system because both segregation by
size and density drive the small particles to the core. In the adhesive case, however, the
interactions between smaller and large particles are enhanced, and segregation (as predicted)
is mitigated (ISwo/Jc = 0.26). The properties of the Janus beads used are αJ = 3.8, βJ =
1.25, φA = φB = 0.95. The dominant Bond Number is Bo1J1, and the Janus particles
are larger but conveniently much more dense than the other particles in the system. This
higher density promotes their migration to the inner core so that this system exhibits small-
Janus-small particle bridges, where these clusters segregate to the inner core (without Janus,
ISwo/J c = 0.26; with Janus, ISw/Jc = 0.29, Figure 27). Note that in this case the dominant
interaction Bo1J1 = 5.1 is again approximately twice as high as the largest mixing interaction
Bo1J2 = Bo2J1 = 2.6.
74
Finally, in an effort to gain insight into the proper number of Janus beads to be used
in an extractant effort, we consider two additional systems containing identical types of
particles but a different proportion of Janus. In the case shown in Figure 27, 19.2% of the
total occupied area corresponds to Janus particles. In Figure 28, we study the effect of a
higher (33.5%) and lower (9.1%) proportion of Janus particles. By increasing the proportion
of Janus particles from 9.1% to 19.2%, no significant difference arises in the asymptotic state
(Figure 27, (ISw/Jc ≈ ISw/Jc−− = 0.29)); however, if the Janus particle concentration is
further increased, a better degree of separation can be reached (ISw/Jc++ = 0.31) giving
a more efficient separation alternative. Nevertheless, this increased concentration of Janus
beads not only would prove more costly in materials, but also would decrease the volume
available for mixed product. Hence, we expect that a balance can be struck when choosing
an appropriate number of Janus beads to use.
4.2.2 Surfactant particles
Surfactant particles are used to enhance mixing in systems d, e and f as shown in Figure
22. The domain where the surfactant particles can be used is reduced and it is located close
to the boundaries between the M and E regions of the adhesive phase-space diagrams. This
means that the systems for which we can enhance mixing are in a limited domain and in
most cases correspond to systems that typically only mildly segregate. Moreover, we have a
smaller window of choices for the feasible Janus bead properties.
Case d corresponds to a case where the less dense particles have a slightly smaller size
(α = 0.52, β = 0.92). The free-flowing as well as the system with no Janus particles tend
to radially segregate. The feasibility domain depicted in Figure 23 and Figure 24 severely
restricts the properties of the Janus beads that can be chosen and make the selection of
Janus particles that would lead to a high BoJiJi unavoidable (i.e., the systems will essentially
always form strong particle micelles). We have simulated a system within this domain with a
predominant mixing interaction of Bo1J2 = 3.36, but, unfortunately with a correspondingly
high BoJAJA = 10.5. The Janus particles in this case tend to cluster together and are not
effective as mixing agents (not shown).

77
System e correspond to a case where the smaller particle is more dense (α = 1.92,
β = 0.92). Because of the density difference, and the fact that the smaller particle is the one
that has a higher surface energy, the adhesive case mildly segregates. In this case, we show
how an initially segregated system mixed in the presence of the Janus particles (αJ = 0.6,
βJ = 0.9, φA = 2.0, φB = 4.0). The predominant Bond number is Bo1J2, however, due to the
fact that the ratio between this and the largest segregation interaction is less than a factor
of two, not surprising, the increase in mixedness is small (without Janus, ISwo/Je = 0.22;
with Janus, ISw/Je = 0.20) over the time-scale simulated here.
Finally, in case f (α = 1.92, β = 0.75 and φ = 0.75), the smaller particles are more
dense, and both segregation by size and density drive the smaller (lighter) particles to the
inner core and the larger and more dense to the periphery. This leads to segregation in
both the free-flowing and binary adhesive cases (Fig.30, ISwo/Jf = 0.34), as predicted by
the phase-space diagram. The Janus particles selected for this case are αJ = 0.2, βJ = 0.75,
φA = 1.5, φB = 1.1. Note that the feasible density values are low (≤ 0.4), if a dramatic size
ratio must be avoided as can be seen in Figure 23. Two simulations were run (Figure 30):
one where the system was initially premixed and another that was initially segregated. Both
cases achieve a degree of mixing (ISw/JfMIX = 0.24 and ISw/JfSEG = 0.30) higher than their
adhesive binary counterpart (ISwo/Jf = 0.34) over the time-scales simulated here.
4.3 CONCLUSIONS
In this work we propose a novel strategy to control the degree of mixing of adhesive particle
systems. The systems studied are dry where adhesive forces caused by van der Waals forces
predominate. By using “helper particles” of biphasic geometry, we can modify the asymptotic
state of the system from mixing to segregation and vice-versa. We distinguish between these
two functionalities denoting them as Janus-surfactants and Janus-extractants, respectively.
In the case of surfactants, although the space where the aids can be used is limited, Janus
particles show some promise of improving the degree of mixing in an initially segregated
system and show a tendency to decrease the kinetics of segregation for systems that are
78
premixed and then subjected to flow. This concept could be applicable industrially when
the granular material is acceptably mixed at the exit of a blending unit, and segregation
occurs as the material flows in a pipe or a conveyor belt. In the case of extractants particles,
the results are even more positive. When it is possible to choose aid particles that yield
a two-fold difference between the highest mixing and segregation Bond numbers, we have
shown a clear ability to both prevent a segregated system from mixing, as well as to induce
segregation in initially mixed beds.

5.0 FLOW AIDS
The ubiquitous appearance of granular materials in the chemical industry implies the need
of making use of their flow properties at one stage or another. Moreover, in some cases
continuous processes depend on the ability of the powder to flow through different devices
and inconsistent flow can lead to expensive plant shut-downs [133].
Powder flowability—or its ability to flow—depends on particle size, density, shape, chemi-
cal composition, moisture content, etc. Because of its industrial relevance and the complexity
of the matter, numerous methods for measuring powder flowability have been developed. In
practice, many of these methods are inconsistent and/or difficult to interpret [134]. A widely
used cohesiveness measure in the pharmaceutic industry is the the Hausner [135] ratio of the
bed. That is the ratio of the ‘aerated bulk density’ (random loose packing) to the ‘tapped
bulk density’ (random close packing). This test is done by letting the dispersed powder set-
tle under the influence of gravity (aerated density) and then tapping the container, allowing
the bed to consolidate (tapped density). Dutta et. al [136] relate decreases in the Hausner
ratio to less cohesive materials. Another widely used methodology to assess the degree of
cohesion of a granular material is the measurement of its angle of repose (AOR). The angle
of repose is measured from the horizontal to the bed’s free surface and it is related to the
critical stress the material can support. The most common methods of measuring the angle
of repose are static/poured piles, discharges hoppers and rotated tumblers [2]. These last
two examples are used in this work, to quantify the flowability of materials.
Flow aids—also known as flow conditioners, free-flowing agents, anti-caking agents, gli-
dants, lubricants—are additives commonly used in the pharmaceutical [137, 138, 105, 139]
and food [140] industry to prevent material from ‘caking’ and improve its flowability. Par-
ticulate silica, silicate, talc and salts of stearic acid have all been used for this purpose [141].
80
Several mechanisms have been proposed for the operation of these aids, which include [142]:
reduction of inter-particle friction by coating the host particles and diminishing their sur-
face irregularities, reduction of adhesive inter-particle forces by imposing a physical barrier,
reduction of the static electrical charge on the host powder. The first mechanism usually
requires a dramatic size ratio between host and conditioner powders while the second and
third, both of which may be considered “adhesive screening” techniques, can work with
modest size differences. In this chapter we will use our model, together with our previously
developed characterization tools, to study how the physical properties of the aid particles
play a significant role in their ability to increase the flowability of the powders in a manner
that is most similar to the “adhesive screening methods”.
5.1 THEORY
Using the same strategy presented in both chapters 3 and 4, we first develop phase-space
diagrams to represent our theoretical predictions and then we compare them with our PD
experiments.
5.1.1 Granular Bond number
The Granular Bond Number defined in section 3.1.1 for binary systems is used in this chapter
to design aid particles that can control the degree of flowability of an adhesive material. The
host granular material is a homogeneous powder (particles 1) characterized by its granular
bond number, Bo11. In the presence of aid particles (particles a), other relevant interactions
arise, including: interactions that promote mixing between the conditioner and the host,
Bo1a, the interactions between aids, Boaa, and the interaction that represent clustering
between aids and particles, Bo1a1. The starting point for these expressions is in Table 3
and simplifications are made considering the aids particles are symmetric (not Janus). The
relevant Bond numbers for this case are summarized in Table 6.

conditioner powder).

5.1.2 Phase Diagrams
In order to identify the properties necessary to impart ‘aid’ characteristics to our helper
particles, we again turn to granular bond number calculations. As with previous cases, we
define Bo values for all relevant interactions in the system (assuming that the aid particles,
a, can bridge interactions), thus we obtain: Bo11, Bo1a1, Boaa, Bo1a.
The primary criteria to identify proper aid particles is that the interactions bridged by
aid particles is weaker than the direct interaction between host particles, that is:
ℜ3 =
Bo1a1
Bo11
< 1 (5.1)
After some manipulation, this constraint can be simplified to
ℜ3 =
2φβ
1 + β
< k2 (5.2)
where β = Ra/R1 and φ =
√
Γaa/Γ11 (analogously to chapters 3 and 4, also α = ρa/ρ1) and
a lower the value of k2 indicates better flowability of the powder. The phase-space diagram in
Figure 31 shows contour lines for different values of ℜ3. Our phase-space diagram indicates
that, in general, smaller particles are better flow aids. Also, as the size ratio decreases, the
functional values of the surface energy ratio of the aid particle becomes less restricted.
82
In addition to this criterion, it is also desirable that the aid particles “naturally” mix
with the host particles at their asymptotic state, such that
ℜ1 =
Bo11
Bo1a
< 1 and ℜ2 =
Boaa
Bo1a
< 1 (5.3)
Our second criteria is preferable, but is not actually a necessary condition; i.e., it is possible
that the aids may be pre-mixed into the host particles and that the operation of interest will
not proceed until the system actually reach its asymptotic state (since segregation needs a
finite time to take place). Therefore, we examine conditions that lead to ℜ1 and ℜ2 values
that are a variety of values, k1. In other words, we expect that the lower the value of
k1, the more predominant the mixing interaction Bo1a is with respect to the other binary
interactions in the system and a better quality of mixture is expected. This idea is depicted
in the phase diagrams as regions of different shades in Figure 31 (light grey, k1 = 1; medium
grey, k1 = 0.5; dark grey, k1 = 0.25). As the density ratio decreases (from right to left in the
diagrams) size and density segregation start to compete, the ‘driving force’ for segregation
diminishes and, therefore, the size of the mixing region for any given mixing quality value
(value of k1) is larger.
5.2 PD SIMULATIONS
5.2.1 Hopper simulations
Hoppers are commonly used devices for storage, feeding of equipment, even blending of a
wide variety of bulk powders—from non-cohesive, free-flowing to highly cohesive, poorly
flowing. In most applications, it is relevant how the granular material will empty the hopper
under the action of gravity. Roughly, two modes can be distinguished: the mass flow (where
the material exits the device in a ‘first in first out’ manner) and the funnel flow (where the
material that is in the center of the container will exit first).
A very simple method to measure the degree of cohesion or flowability of a material is
to observe the static angle of repose of the heap in a rectangular bottomed hopper after the

material has been discharged. In this section, we simulate the discharge from such hoppers
as shown in Figure 32 and compare the static angle of the remaining heap after the discharge.
The hopper width is 50 times the particle diameter and particles are initially randomly placed
in the devices, and allowed to settle. After that the hopper orifice—located in extreme right
of the device and with a width equal to 10 particle diameters—is opened and the material
starts to flow. The result of these experiments correspond to the angle that the remaining
material forms after the flow has stopped.
The aim of this section is to show how the cohesiveness of the material can be modified
by the addition of aids. In Figure 33, the angle of repose for the free-flowing, pure adhesive
host powder and two cases where the the host powder has been conditioned by two different
aids. The composition of aids is such that they occupy 25% of the total particle area.
The properties correspond to systems B and D in Table 7. The properties of the base
case material are those in Table 4. The values of ℜ3 (0.067 and 0.007) indicate that the
flowability of the combined powder is better than the pure host. Next, we take case D and
increase the composition of the flow aids in terms of occupied area from 25% to 33% (Figure
34). Although we expected the angle to further decrease, the result shows that the surface
becomes more irregular as we increase the aid content. This can be understood in terms of
the bond number: the Bo1a1 (0.62) is lower than the bond number Bo11 (3.9), however the
bond number Boaa is equal to 0.74, so that increasing the probability of an aa interaction
negatively impact the surface angle relative to the 25% mix case (but it still implies an
improvement over the pure host material).
5.2.2 Tumbler simulations
In the rolling regime, the free surface angle with the horizontal can be used as a cohesion
metric. In our second simulation setup, the dynamic angle of the free surface in a rotating
tumbler is used to measure the degree of cohesiveness of the host material. The systems
simulated are identified in Figure 31 and their respective properties are tabulated in Tables
4 and 7. The results are presented in Figure 35 where all cases correspond to the same host
powder properties. All simulations have been run for at least 2 revolutions at a rotation

rate of 5 [rpm], and in the case of flow aid conditioned material, the host powder has been
‘premixed’. That is, host and conditioner particles are randomly placed inside the tumbling
device and allowed to be settled by the action of gravity. This eliminates, at least over short
times, the requirement that the Bo1a must be dominant relative Bo11 and Boaa.
The case without glidant corresponds to the tumbler on the far left. Three different
aids corresponding to cases labeled as E, A and D are shown in the top, middle and bottom
rows, respectively. From left to right the area composition of aids increase from 0% (leftmost
column), to 25%, to 39%, to 50%. The rightmost column shown tumbler snapshots containing
only aids. The ℜ3 values decrease from top to bottom indicating better flow properties. This
is confirmed by the dynamic repose angles we measured. The system with no aids has an
angle of repose of 49 degrees, which decreases to 34–35 degrees with 25% aids. As expected
in every case, as the aid composition is increased the repose angle decreases and approaches
that of the pure aids. In the lower row, aids D are shown to be the most efficient with a ℜ3
of 0.067.
For all three aid types (E, A, D) in Figure 35 the bond number corresponding to the
interaction aa is again higher than that corresponding to the interaction 1a1. This is unavoid-
able for systems that satisfy the mixing conditions. In the case of the hopper we observed
that increasing the aid content did not further improve the powder’s flowability properties.
However, this effect is not observed in rotating tumblers. This can be understood by virtue
of the fact that, in the hopper case, aa was larger than 1a1, so increasing the content of
aid particles made the interactions aa more frequent. In contrast, the tumbler case is a
“thermalized” system where particles can choose their most favorable asymptotic partner.
Since Boaa ¡ Bo1a (satisfying mixing constraints), particles a will prefer to bond with host
particles 1 rather than other aids, and further facilitate interactions 1a1. Therefore, we can
conclude that increasing the number of aid particles can be detrimental if and only if the
system is not properly thermalized.
Next, we tested the material using aid particles that are expected to improve the flowa-
bility properties in different degrees according to their respectives values of ℜ3. In Figure
36, the snapshot on the far left corresponds to aids A (ℜ3 = 1.3) and three different sys-
tems have been studied (C1, C2 and C3 in Table 7) to explore the effect of changing the aid
89
properties giving different ℜ3 values. All four snapshots were taken after the tumblers have
completed exactly 2 revolutions and auxiliar lines have been drawn in each case to estimate
their respective AORs. As expected, the flow properties of the material deteriorate as we use
aids with higher values of ℜ3. However, it can be seen in our phase diagrams (Figure 31),
that in this particluar set the lower the value of ℜ3, the closer to the E (Enhanced segrega-
tion) phase our system are. This explains why system A on the far left (Figure 36) already
starts exhibiting segregation after two revolutions deteriorating the performance of the flow
aids in the system (irregular free surface). Our last experiment explore the importance of
satisfying the mixing constraints described in equation 5.3 in the aids performance. Figure
37 shows how the AOR of a system containing aids B increases—and its flow properties
deteriorate—as it becomes more and more segregated.

of aids increases from no-aids to pure aids.
91
Figure 36: Dynamic angle of repose for systems containing aids A, C1, C2, C3. As value of
ℜ3 increases, the flow properties of the mixture deteriorate.
Note that, in our theory, we have assumed that the particular mechanism by which
our aids work corresponds to the one that involves imposing a physical barrier between the
host particles and thus disabling adhesive interactions between them. We have somewhat
arbitrarily chosen a size ratio between aids to host particles equal to 0.5, while in indus-
trial practice it is common to find differences of one or two order of magnitudes between
the aid and host particle dimensions [141]. In our case, this is due to the computational
limitations of simulating those systems. Not only does a large size difference dramatically
increase the necessary number of particles, but also it severely hampers contact detection
routines. However, it is important to clarify that this theory would still apply to those cases
where the size ratio decreases to lower values. The limit is determined by the underlying
physical mechanism we attempt to model: when the absolute value of the aid particle size is
comparable to the range of action of the adhesive force involved. Forces of van der Waals are
short range so that two micron-sized particles separated by any distance larger than 1/10 of
the particle diameter would feel van der Waals forces that are negligible when compared to
gravity forces. In this way, an aid particle that forces a distance between host particles equal
to 1/10 (or greater) of the particle diameter would have the potential to efficiently screen
the Bo11 interaction.

nally pre-mixed) start segregating, and the aid particles become inefficient.
5.3 CONCLUSIONS
In this Chapter, we have proposed a criteria to design glidants to increase the flowability
of an adhesive granular material. Their performance can be assessed as the ratio (ℜ3) of
the strength of the host-aid-host (Bo1a1) particle interactions to the strength of the host-
host (Bo11) interaction. In the case of a flowing material (e.g. rotating tumbler), the
conditions previously developed in Chapter 3 that guarantee mixing of the material also
apply. The designed aids have been shown to improve the flowability properties of the
material commensurate with the predicted values of ℜ3. As expected, when the content
of glidants is increased, the angle of repose approaches the value of the system containing
purely aids.

6.0 MIXING AND HEATING IN GRANULAR MATERIALS
Granular materials subjected to agitation are encountered in many practical applications
of material processing. Furthermore, many of these applications also involve heat transfer
whereby solids come into contact with cooling or heating surfaces and heat is exchanged
not only between individual particles, but also between the particles and external surfaces
during the duration of the particle-particle or particle-surface contact. The magnitude of
the heat exchanged during any of these events depends on the thermo-physical properties
of the particles and the surfaces/walls, the interstitial fluid, the shape of the particles and
the contact time [35], among other variables. The flow behavior in these heating/cooling
devices not only impacts the rates of heat transfer within the bulk material, but also has
a significant impact on the overall mixing rate within these devices. In this work we will
distinguish between “particle-level” mixing, which is due primarily to the randomization
induced by inter-particle collisions, and advective or large-scale mixing which is due to the
gross motion of large groups of particles. When the shearing force is small, only minor
shifting of the particles occurs so mixing rates (both particle-level and advective) are small,
yet the particles experience multiple lasting contacts which lead to force networks or “stress
chains” [143, 144] that contribute to good particle-particle conduction [145]. As the shearing
increases, significant dilation of the structure takes place such that deformation of the bulk
material occurs along localized slipping planes [146] and the structure of the stress chains
has a random transient character[147]. These changes lead to good particle-level mixing, but
decreased particle-particle conduction rates (as the contact strength and duration decreases).
Moreover, gross motion within the particle bed is now possible so that advective (large-scale)
mixing can occur in addition to the mixing occurring solely at the particle scale. Naturally,
there is a balance that must be struck whereby inter-particle (and particle-surface) contacts
94
are sufficient to promote good conduction while at the same time agitation is high enough
that thermal gradients can be enhanced via mixing. The general problem of heat transfer
encountered in a rotating tumbler is a very common one in chemical engineering [148] and
this prototypical case serves as our testbed in the current work. Depending on the process
and material variables, heat transfer between heated surfaces and particles in motion may
be dominated by contact conductance. This process constitutes one of the basic mechanisms
of heat transfer in particulate systems [86, 36] and this specific issue has been addressed
by many authors [149, 35, 83, 36]. Recently, researchers have turned toward the thermally-
modified discrete modeling technique Thermal Particle Dynamics (TPD) [84] as a means of
studying such issues as the role of particle-wall versus particle-particle heat transfer[150],
the impact of baffles and/or cohesion [89], and the influence of interstitial gases [91], to
name a few. In this study, we specifically examine the interplay between mixing and heat
transfer in granular media composed of uniform-sized spheres undergoing slow flow in a
tumbler mixer using Thermal Particle Dynamics (TPD) [84]. We vary the mixing/heating
rate by using different cross-sectional shapes (circular, square and elliptical) as well as two
values of rotation rate for the simulated tumblers. The changing shapes are particularly of
interest as commonly used industrial mixing devices have non-circular shapes; for example,
a V-blender has an elliptical cross-section with respect to its rotation axis, or in the case of
double-cone blender, the cross-section is a polygon. At the same time, in these non-circular
drum geometries, the periodic change of the length of the shear layer promotes chaotic
advection and can dramatically improve the advective mixing rate [123] with little impact
on the particle-scale mixing or contact duration.
6.1 MIXING RATE ANALYSIS
In the context of heat transfer, the mixing process serves to equalize the temperature within
the drum and maintain as high of a thermal gradient as possible near the heated surfaces. It
has been well documented [151, 152, 153, 146, 154, 155] that axial mixing in a tumbler can be
well described by a simple diffusive relation. On the other hand, radial mixing, while much
95
faster than axial mixing, is considerably more complex—depending strongly on both drum
filling and rotation rate. Moreover, segregation, when present, is much more pronounced
in the radial direction than in the axial direction. In the systems treated here, heat from
the hot walls to the (initially) cold granular material. It is expected, therefore, that radial
mixing will have a much stronger influence on the heat transfer process than axial mixing
does. Despite its complexity, radial mixing has been extensively studied [156, 123, 157, 158]
and can be generalized in the following way: mixing occurs when circulation times vary
as a function of radial position; diffusive mixing—which causes particles to move across
streamlines—is due to collisions within the shearing, surface layer.
6.1.1 Measuring radial mixing
As mentioned above, the mixing rate is of critical importance in the present work. By
tagging a portion of the mechanically identical particles as tracers we can use the Intensity
of Segregation (IS) [121], which is a measure of the variability of the concentration of tracers
in a number of spatially disparate samples, as a means of quantifying the mixing. In all of
our cases—composed of identical particles—the value of IS will asymptotically decrease to
the perfectly mixed value, but by observing its evolution we can determine the mixing rate
of the system. As the heat is added to the system radially, from the outside in, our particles
are color-tagged according to their initial radial position: particles in the inner core—far
from the heated wall—are assigned to one color, while particles in the perispherical region
are tagged with another one. This allows us to study the mixing evolution specifically in the
direction of highest initial thermal gradient. In all cases there is an exponential decay in the
IS value that can be fitted to an equation of the form
IS = C0e
(−2πkmixt). (6.1)
The fitted curves are shown as solid lines in Figure 39. A mixing rate constant, kmix, can then
be determined by fitting these curves to equation 6.1. The values are tabulated in Table 8. In
general, the mixing rate increases with rotation rate and with decreasing the fill level of the
drum. These observations agree well with those from the literature [159, 160, 161, 152, 153].
96
Figure 38: Schematic of a rotating cylinder with heat exchange at the wall, showing the
definition of the shear layer thickness δ. The shear layer defines the region within the bed
where the main motion of the particles is taking place (heat advection region), and defines the
boundary from the region of solid-body rotation (heat conduction region). Representative
streamlines, the coordinate system and the relevant system parameters are also shown.

High rates of heat transfer and high heat transfer coefficients are expected under conditions
in which there is a rapid exchange between particles in the bulk and those close to the wall,
(i.e., higher rates of mixing). As expected, Figure 40a shows, for a half filled tumbler, that
increasing the rotation rate (thus, increasing the mixing rate; see Table 8) increases the rate
of heat transfer. However, for a filling level of 0.25—where the mixing rates are about 100
times higher than for a half-filled tumbler—the opposite trend is observed with respect to
rotation rate (See Figure 40c). In these cases, the higher mixing rates resulting from the
increased rotation rate seem to lead to a slower heating of the particles inside the tumbler.
Therefore, although rapid mixing rates typically favor faster heating rates, it is clear that
this is not the only factor determining the rate with which granular material will heat. This
observation was the primary impetus for the current work.
6.1.2 Analyzing heating mechanisms
As is true in fluids, heat can be transferred in granular materials by different mechanisms—
conduction, convection and radiation. Since the temperatures concerned in this study are
assumed to be relatively low, radiant heat transfer is neglected. Moreover, as the purpose
of this study is to examine the impact of mixing on the relative importance of conduction
and convection, the interstitial fluid is neglected (simulations are performed under vacuum
conditions). Heat conduction occurs whenever two or more particles are in contact and
the amount of energy transferred by this mechanism depends not only on the temperature
98
Figure 39: Variation of the Intensity of Segregation with different rotation rates at constant
filling degree f = 0.37 and f = 0.5. For a half filled tumbler f = 0.5, the circulation time of
the material in the bed is independent of radial position thus mixing takes place at a very
low rate. In contrast, for less than half filled drums (f → 0), the circulation time varies with
radial position and therefore mixing is more rapid [160].

within the drum varies in a logarithmic fashion, although the local temperature evolution of individual particles is highly

difference but also on the size of the contact area and the duration of the contact. In
consequence, the mechanical properties of the particle (such as the shear modulus or the
Young’s modulus) will impact the rate of conductive/diffusive transfer of heat through the
particles. On the other hand, convection of heat corresponds to the transfer of energy
associated with the movement of particles relative to one another, where particles from
hotter regions are physically moved to colder zones, and vice versa. In this work, we use the
Péclet number to determine the heat transfer mechanism that is expected to be dominant
in the overall bed heating. The Péclet number for granular systems is calculated as follows:
Pe =
{mixing rate}
{rate of thermal diffusion} =
1
tmix
αT
λ2
(6.2)
where tmix will be obtained from the slope of a log-lin IS plot, αT is the effective thermal
diffusivity of the particle bed, and λ is the characteristic length of the system. For our
rotating tumblers of different cross-sectional shapes, we have used the equivalent diameter
of the drum λ. Using this definition, a system characterized by a low Péclet number is
one where heat is predominantly transferred within the bed by inter-particle conduction,
and a high Péclet number indicates that convection, or the motion of hot particles, is the
predominant mechanism. It should be noted that, unlike the case of a fluid system, in a
granular system the rate of heat diffusion through the “material” itself is not independent of
the mixing rate as it is defined in equation 6.2 because of the change in the effective thermal
conductivity with the changing bed microstructure.
6.1.3 Apparent heat transfer coefficient
In order to quantify the impact of mixing on the overall rate of heat transfer within tumbler-
type devices, we use an apparent heat transfer coefficient, hT . This value is related to the
difference between the wall temperature and the average temperature in the granular phase,
thus it incorporates not only the transfer of the heat from the wall to the particle bed, but
also the transfer between the particles within the bed itself. Using this simple definition of
hT and performing an overall balance of heat in the granular bed, we can derive an equation
for hT as:
ρVBc
d〈T 〉
dt
= hTAT (TW − 〈T 〉) (6.3)
101
where VB is the volume of the granular bed, AT is the area in contact with the tumbler
walls, 〈T 〉 is the mean temperature in the granular bed, and TW is the wall temperature.
We then obtain the apparent heat transfer coefficient (hT ) from the slope of the heating
curve (i.e., plots of ln
(
TW−T0
TW−〈T 〉
)
versus time; see Figure 41). It should be noted that, in
previous work [150, 162], the apparent heat transfer coefficient defined in Eqn. 6.3 was shown
to vary with time (making it less useful of a discriminatory tool for our purposes). In order
to examine this tendency in the current mixing study we simulated several two-dimensional
systems composed of soft particles (E∗ = 30[MPa], ρ = 1000[Kg/m3], c = 385[J/KgK],
ν = 0.33, dp = 4[mm]) and observed how rapidly hT reached a constant value as the
heating process evolves. Low (k = 1.0[W/mK]) and high (k = 1000.0[W/mK]) thermal
conductivity systems are examined with tumblers whose diameter is 40 times the particle
diameter. To cover the range of parameter space to be studied in this work, we vary the
relative value of the conductance in equation 2.33 for wall—particle contacts with respect
to those values for the particle-particle contacts. In our base case, as well as in all other
cases present in the following sections, the tumbler walls are composed of particles of the
same material as the particles inside the drum, so the resistance is comparable for both kind
of contacts (HcWP /HcPP = 1). By making the resistance at the wall significantly higher
(HcWP /HcPP = 0.01), the flow of energy to the granular bed from the walls is expected to
become the bottleneck. The opposite case is also presented, where the resistance between
the particles in the bed is dominant (HcWP /HcPP = 100). All three situations are studied at
both high and low Péclet number values by changing the base value of HcPP to correspond
to the high and low conductivity materials, respectively (recalling that Hcij = 2ksaij for
particle–particle transport, see Table 9). In almost all cases examined, hT rapidly reaches
a constant value as indicated by the slopes of the heating curves shown in Figure 41. The
hT values and the correlation coefficients for the linear regressions in Figure 41 are shown in
Table 9. The only hT value that exhibits a significant dependence on time is that of the low
value of Péclet with high wall resistance. Even then, a relatively constant value is expected
after approximately the first revolution (10 seconds). Interestingly, the apparent hT values
obtained for cases HcWP /HcPP = 0.01 and HcWP /HcPP = 1.0 are almost exactly proportional
to the prescribed HcWP /HcPP in the case of high Péclet value, but show no such dependence

in the case of low Péclet number. This suggests that the apparent value of hT can, in fact,
be used as a discriminator for the relative importance of the mixing rate. Moreover, as we
will allow the transport rate between the wall and the bed to be determined “naturally”
from the contacts been wall-based and moving particles (i.e., HcWP /HcPP = 1), we expect
that time variation of hT will not significantly impact our results.
6.1.4 Heating and mixing rate
In order to analyze the relationship between mixing and heating, several simulations were
run for two different materials: glass and aluminum. Glass and aluminum have been chosen
as the pure materials because they exhibit thermal diffusivity values differing by almost
a factor of 100 (αTAl = 7.4 × 10−5m2/s and αTGlass = 7.9 × 10−7m2/s). The differences
in mechanical properties, however, are not as dramatic, so mixing rates for both systems
are expected to be comparable. The tumbler rotation speed is varied, as is the tumbler
cross-sectional shape, leading to a range of mixing rates. For each case, the apparent heat
transfer coefficient and the mixing rate are calculated as described in the previous sections.
Schlünder [162] studied the transfer of heat in a stirred particle system by assuming that the
process occurs in two steps: first, the heat needs to be captured from the hot walls to the
granular phase; second, the heat needs to be re-dispersed within the whole bed. He noted
that each of these steps have to overcome different heat transfer resistances and either of
them could become the process bottleneck. Each of those resistances were then estimated
from a continuous penetration model introducing one empirical parameter to describe the

Two different tumbler rotation rates are shown: 5 [rpm] (◦) and 18 [rpm] (•), as are several
tumbler geometries (see symbol shape; noting that the ellipse with a vertical line has an axis
ratio of 0.7, with a horizontal line has a ratio of 0.5, and no line corresponds to a ratio of
0.6).

particle motion—the mixing number. The work of Kwapinska et al. aimed to bridge a
discrete modeling approach to this continuous model where the local resistances were chosen
to mimic an effective equivalent thermal conductivity of the granular bed. In order to
understand the results of the previous section (See Figure 40) it is useful to note that,
while increased mixing rates clearly impact this second step, they also have a non-negligible
impact on the particle-wall contact duration and perhaps even the size of the particle-wall
contact area. As evidence of this explanation first, we attempt to directly correlate the
mixing and heating rates for the glass particle simulations. Figure 42a (left) shows that no
clear relation can be drawn between the heat transfer coefficient and the mixing rate of each
system studied. This suggests that the second step is not the rate limiting step. In contrast,
Figure 42a (right), shows the relationship between the apparent heat transfer coefficient
and wall-particle collision time and we find that for a fixed rotation rate, the longer the
wall-particle collisions, the higher the heating rate.
In contrast to glass, where particle collisions need to be relatively long to allow heat
to flow between the particles, a highly conductive material (like aluminum) can effectively
transmit heat during a collision of significantly shorter time. Figure 42b shows the rela-
tionship between the heat transfer coefficient and the mixing rates and it can be seen that
in this set of simulations increasing the rate of mixing leads to faster heating. Meanwhile,
the relationship with the collision time is not clear. This suggests that the redistribution of
heated particles is the rate limiting step in the aluminum cases studied.
6.1.5 A scaling attempt
Next, in this work, we attempt to draw a correlation between the calculated Péclet number
and the rate of transfer of heat. In fluid systems, its is common to relate the rate of heat
transfer using the Nusselt number and correlations of the general form
Nu = ξ0 Pe
ξ
1 (6.4)
can often be found (with varying values of ξ0 and ξ1). While rates of thermal diffusion needed
to estimate the Péclet number are expected to be proportional to the thermal diffusivity of

the material used, when calculating these dimensionless numbers for heterogeneous systems,
the main difficulty resides in estimating the effective properties of the granular bed. Here, the
density and specific heat have been calculated as ρ = ρS(1− ε) and c ∼ cS, where ρS and cS
are the pure material density and specific heat, respectively. Analogously, the conductivity
is estimated by k = kS(1− ε). Not surprisingly, despite the system heterogeneity, the Péclet
numbers for the glass particle simulations (Pe > 1) are found to be significantly higher than
those for aluminum (< 0.5) (See Table 10).
In Figure 43, the measured Nu numbers are plotted versus Pe for the variety of systems
studied thus far. From the analysis presented here, no universal dependency encloses the
whole data set; however, for each data set the Nusselt number is linearly dependent on
the Péclet when the data is presented in a log-log plot (where the slope corresponds to b in
equation 6.4). A more accurate estimation of the effective properties of the agitated granular
materials—that considers the effect of their microstructure—could reconcile the results for
different materials.

6.2 MIXING TOPOLOGY AND HEAT TRANSFER
Similar to their continuum fluid counterparts, non-cohesive granular materials under flow can
display chaotic advection [156, 7, 123, 158]. The nature of these patterns depends on a host
of factors, including among others the filling level and geometry of the boundaries. When
chaotic advection takes place inside a rotating vessel, the mixing rate can be dramatically
enhanced with little or no impact on the particle-level mixing rate. The impact of this type
of flow on heat transfer in granular materials has not been explored.
In all of the systems studied, it is expected that the mixing patterns/topology interacts
in a nontrivial way with the heat transfer process. When the granular material is heated
from the tumbler walls, no heat is expected to be transferred into the islands by an advective
flow and increases in temperature of the particles in these regions are the result of a thermal
diffusive flux only. Therefore, in systems where the Pe is large such that the conductive
flow of heat is the limiting step in the heat transfer process, the presence of these islands
in the mixing topology should be more pronounced in the temperature profiles/contours as
the convective transport rapidly distributes heat in the chaotic regions (i.e., outside these
islands). Snapshots of the per-particle temperature profile—for a mean non-wall particle

dimensionless temperature equal to 0.1—are also shown in Figure 44 for three tumbler ge-
ometries and two materials —aluminum (left) and glass (right)—as well as the corresponding
depth-averaged temperature contour plots. Differences in the glass and aluminum cases can
be observed even for the simplest case, a circular cross-sectional tumbler. Flow lines are
symmetrical with respect to the tumbler rotation center and the glass system follows this
pattern more closely, exhibiting a temperature profile that is almost perfectly symmetric. In
contrast, in the aluminum-filled tumbler, several hot spots can be observed in the right half
of the perispherical region of the aluminum tumbler, however, in the left half the temperature
profile is more uniform. This is because the aluminum particles yield a low Pe so that any
redistribution of heat from the particle-level mixing (during a single layer pass) is quickly
diffused to neighboring particles during the course of a half-revolution (i.e., as the particle
rotate from right to left). At the same time, a larger cold core of particles can be seen
in the aluminum snapshot to compensate for the hot spots while achieving the same mean
non-wall particle temperature. In the square cross-sectional tumbler, two eye-shaped cold
cores are expected in the temperature profile based on observation of the Poincaré sections.
As expected, the shape of these regions is better defined in the temperature plots of the glass
system when compared to the aluminum case, with a characteristic “hill” in the center of the
wall span being evident. Similarly, in the elliptical tumbler there is a difference between the
systems. While in the glass simulations the two cold cores—islands—are clearly delimited
and separated by a slightly higher temperature zone, in the aluminum simulation the islands
are not easily identified from each other and the temperature seems to be almost rotationally
symmetric. As further quantitative evidence of the impact of mixing topology, Figure 45
highlights the presence or lack of rotational symmetry by showing the average particle tem-
perature along a radial arm projecting from the tumbler center at three different angles with
respect to the free surface. These angles have been chosen to determine planes that intersect
different structures in the respective—circular, square or elliptical—Poincaré sections. The
mean temperature is obtained by averaging the temperature of all particles within a distance
of one particle diameter from the planes, and it is plotted against the radial distance scaled
by the particle diameter. As in the previous figure, both the glass and aluminum results
are shown at a time that corresponds to when the mean dimensionless temperature in the
111
granular bed is approximately 0.1 and the surface of the material is parallel to one of the
axes of the cross section shape. In the case of a circular tumbler, all three radial profiles
(a, b and c) pass first through the warm shear layer and next across one central cold struc-
ture. After this cold core, the temperature increases as the planes approach the hot wall.
Due to the rotational symmetry of the circular mixer’s Poincaré section, all three planes
yield roughly the same result for both glass and aluminum (see Figure 45 (left)). Next, in
the square tumbler, the Poincaré section suggests that the three temperature profiles must
differ: profiles a and c each diagonally cross one of the two big cold cores, while profile b
passes across the well-mixed region. This is confirmed by 45 (center) where curves a and
c coincide in the size and location of these cold cores and profile b indicates the presence
of a reduced low temperature region. Finally, the elliptical case presents this same kind of
asymmetry: two of the profiles intersect the unmixed regions—and, therefore, diminished
heat transferred by convection of particles—while the third one passes only a very minor
region of cold particles due to the higher rate of mixing along that plane. As expected, the
profiles a and c are quite similar and show a much larger cold core than profile b.
6.3 CONCLUSIONS
We have shown that, depending on the limiting step in the transfer of heat through the
media, increasing mixing rates may be detrimental to the heating of the granular bed, rather
than enhance it. This is because higher mixing rates often imply shorter collision times,
which negatively impacts the transport of heat from the walls to low-conductivity particles.
Making an analogy to fluid transport, we propose a Péclet number to distinguish between
these cases. Higher values of the Péclet number are associated with already fast-mixing beds,
where the heat conduction between particles in contact is governing the rate of heating. In
these cases, decreasing the mixing rate—by operating at a lower tumbler rotation rate,
for example—could provide longer particle contacts and, therefore, faster heating. In the
opposite case, for lower Péclet numbers, the conduction times are short enough not to be
affected by the diminishing collision times associated with higher mixing rates, and enhanced

simulations. The combination symbol (open and filled) denotes a plane perpendicular to the free surface (i.e., vertical); while
the open and filled symbols, respectively, denote planes ±45◦(circle and square) or ±60◦ (ellipse) with respect to the free surface.
113
mixing (via higher rotation rate) actually leads to more rapid transfer of heat to the bed.
These conclusions seem independent of particle type, mixer geometry, and mixer rotation
rate. As a potential method of avoiding this “mixing pitfall”, we also studied the mixing
and thermal topologies obtained in chaotic/non-chaotic tumblers. The results of our TPD
simulations for different tumbler cross-sectional shapes reveal a close relationship between
patterns observed in the Poincaré section of the flow generated by a continuum model and
the observed temperature field. Regions of cold particles are present inside the unmixed
regions observed in the the Poincaré sections, and this tendency is more pronounced for high
Péclet number systems. This suggests that higher mixing rates, even in high Pe tumblers,
may be possible without the subsequent thermal penalty provided they are achieved via
advection rather than increasing solely particle-level mixing (through higher rotation rates).

7.0 SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Granular materials are ubiquitous in the chemical industry. Because of their heterogeneous
nature no universal set of equation can describe them. Furthermore, the intuition we have
built from our knowledge of continuous media frequently misleads us when we try to pre-
dict their behavior. Nevertheless, while a direct application of fluid system approaches are
often unsuccessful, much can be learned through analogies between these disparate sys-
tems. In this dissertation, we studied the behavior of granular materials and compared them
with that of fluids with the aim of exploiting analogies to established fluid-fluid processing
techniques/theory whenever possible. In Chapters 3 and 4 we focused on predicting and con-
trolling mixing/segregation of dry adhesive granular materials. Chapter 5 explored how to
control the flowability of granular materials. In Chapter 6, we studied the effects of heating
mechanisms on the overall heat transfer rate in a granular bed.
Most of the work presented in this dissertation was carried out using a DEM simulation
technique: Particle Dynamics (PD). PD is based on following each particle’s position, ve-
locities, angular velocities, orientation and temperature and updating them each time step
according to (particle-particle or wall-particle) interactions. The essence of PD is dependent
on the nature and accuracy of these interactions. Our PD is capable of computing dry-
adhesive forces (JKR theory), following non-symmetric particle orientation (quaternions)
and modeling exchange of heat.
In this Chapter, we summarize our contributions in each of the topics approached in
this dissertation and outline possible directions for future work in these areas—mixing &
segregation, heat transfer and flowability of powders.
115
7.1 MIXING & SEGREGATION
Many of the industries that handle granular material rely on the preparation of good mixtures
along their production lines. Segregation can cause product rejection, quality/effectiveness
loss, operational problems, etc. In Chapter 3, we have focussed on granular materials where
dry adhesive forces are predominant such as fine powders commonly used in the pharma-
ceutical industry. We developed a characterization tool, the Granular Bond Number( Boij)
to predict the relative strength of inter-particle interactions. This tool is used to build
phase-space diagrams where regions of mixing/segregation—miscible/immiscible—regions
are present as a function of the physical properties of the system. The mixing/segregation
criteria is based on comparing the relative magnitudes of the Boijs in the system (e.g. for
binary case: Bo11, Bo22, Bo12) and arguing that whenever the interaction between dissimilar
particles is the predominant interaction, the system will mix. When the dominant interac-
tion is one between particles of the same kind (Bo11 or Bo22), the result will be a segregated
asymptotic state. We tested our predictions by simulating a variety of powder mixture con-
ditions and observing their tendencies to mix/segregate in tumblers. Our results show that
the asymptotic state of these systems agree with the phase diagrams predictions.
Additionally, we have proposed the use of Janus particles to control these asymptotic
states when in a region of the phase-space diagram that would “naturally” lead to an unde-
sired asymptotic state. A Janus particle can act as a bridge and strengthen interactions that
would be very weak otherwise. We call a ‘surfactant’ a particle that helps mix a system that
would segregate otherwise and and ‘extractant’ a particle that has the opposite function,
in analogy with fluids. We extend the Bond number to interactions that are bridged by
Janus particles (Bo1J1) and determine, using scaling arguments, if a given system that can
potentially be controlled by using Janus particles. Systems with extractant and surfactant
particles were simulated. We showed how extractants can be used to induce segregation in
initially mixed systems and how the use of Janus particles can improve the degree of mixture
in systems that tend to segregate.
Future directions in exploiting cohesion to control mixing/segregation could explore the
impact of particle-wall interactions. For example, if the particle-wall interactions (Boi−wall)
116
of the components (i = 1, 2) of a granular mixture differ significantly, this difference could be
used for particle separation. Following our analogy with fluids, this idea can be conceived as
‘granular chromatography’. In a simple test, a sample of particles, initially mixed, is dropped
on a inclined plane and travel downhill with an average velocity that mostly depends on the
angle with the horizontal and friction forces. If the wall vertically vibrates and cohesive
interactions exist in the system—because of liquid bridges, for example—the interactions
between the wall and the particles will determine how fast each type of particle can move
downhill as well as the particle retention time. As cohesive forces (in terms of the Boi−wall)
become stronger, wall collisions will retard the traveling particles and the originally mixed
sample can exit the device separated by component in increasing order of wall-cohesion
interaction strength.
Another area that could be explored using a concept inspired by the physics of fluids is
separation of granular material based on the ‘granular temperature’. A device that provides
a ‘granular temperature gradient’ can provoke the separation of a free-flowing system. An
example of such a device is one where the bottom wall of a granular bed oscillates with
different amplitudes along its horizontal length. This can be achieved by pivoting one ex-
treme while the other extreme is moved up and downwards at a certain frequency. If the
wall acceleration is higher than gravity, all particles in the granular bed will be vibrated and
migrate from the high amplitude (granular temperature) to the low amplitude end of the
device. The traveling velocity in this case again depends on the particle properties and those
particles that can reach a higher temperature will have a higher driving force and reside for
a shorter time in the device.
7.2 HEAT TRANSFER
Many of the industrial applications of granular materials also involve heat transfer. Granular
solids come into contact with cooling or heating surfaces as in processes such as drying,
chemical reactions, product preservation, etc. Heat is exchanged between particles and/or
particles and surfaces during their contact. The amount of heat that is being transferred
117
depends on the flow of granular materials: the bed conductivity is a function of its micro-
structure. On the other hand, heat redistribution depends on particle mixing/segregation
because of the convective motion that it is associated with it. In Chapter 6, we studied
the effect of the mixing rate on the heating rate of a granular material. We used the
Péclet number to determine the dominant heating mechanism—conduction or convection—
and to predict conditions that will favor more rapid flow of thermal energy in the granular
bed. The rate of heat transport is characterized using the Nusselt number and a fluids-
inspired relationship correlating this quantity with the Péclet values is attempted. A mixing
continuum model is also used in this section to compare mixing patterns and temperature
contours and better agreement was found for the convection dominated cases as expected.
The fact that the governing heat transfer mechanism in a system can determine macro-
scopic quantities such as heating rates and temperature contours calls for a more fundamental
approach in our future work. The goal is to explore the effect of these mechanisms in the
overall ability of a granular flow to conduct heat. Although heating and mixing tumblers
are devices that have a wide industrial applicability, they limit our possibilities to control
which mechanism dominates the transfer of heat. A periodic shear flow seems to be a more
appropriate choice, because of the wide range of solid fractions and shear rates that are
physically feasible. High shear rates and low solid fractions provide conditions were most
heat should be transferred by convection—particles carry their energy as they move from
one place to another—and collisions between particles are short and infrequent. In contrast,
low shear rates and high solid fraction will hinder the convective movement of particles
and promote frequent and long lasting collisions, suggesting that conduction should be the
dominant mechanism.
For fluids, higher shear rates imply higher heat transfer rates and therefore higher ef-
fective conductivity values. In the case of conduction-dominated heat transfer, higher shear
rates can cause shorter collision times and thus reduced transfer of heat. A heat trans-
fer study in a system like this one could enable us to identify regions where the granular
material behaves as a fluid (higher shear rate, higher heat transfer) from other where the
opposite behavior can be observed. At the same time, the momentum fluxes can be com-
puted. However, we do not expect that the transfer of momentum exhibit the same kind
118
of mechanism-dependent trend, since momentum is rapidly transferred during collisions and
the amount of momentum transferred from one particle to another is independent of the
duration of a collision.
7.3 FLOWABILITY
Another critical point for those industries that process and handle adhesive granular material
is its flow properties. A common practice to improve the flowability properties of a powder
is to use flow aids. These are micro or nano-sized particles that have shown in practice to
have this ability. The selection of the aid particle properties is currently done mostly by
trial and error. In Chapter 5, we use our Boij tool to design and assess the performance of
these particles. In order to be efficient, the interactions between the host powder that are
bridged by aid particles (Bo1a1) must be significantly weaker than the interactions between
host particles, Bo11—although the interaction Bo1a is also preferably stronger that Bo11.
Under this criteria, we selected and simulated systems with and without aids and assessed
their flowability in terms of their angle of repose. The static angle of repose was measured
in the remaining heaps after hopper discharge and the dynamic case in a rotating tumbler.
Systems with low value of Bo1a1/Bo11 were shown to have improved flow properties with
respect to those cases of high Bo1a1/Bo11 and those containing no aids.

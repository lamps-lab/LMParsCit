Abstract
The rest-frame UV, optical, and X-ray are important wavebands to study quasar
activities because they trace ionization phases and dynamical properties of the physical
structures surrounding the central engine, including the accretion disk, the broad line
region, and the outflow.
This thesis investigates the correlations of spectral components (continua, emis-
sion lines and absorption lines) and the physical conditions implied by these components
using well-defined samples of spectra from the archives of the Sloan Digital Sky Sur-
vey (SDSS), the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), the International Ultraviolet Explorer
(IUE), the Swift Space Telescope, and the Keck Telescope. The scientific goal of these
studies is to produce a set of well-documented properties of quasar UV, optical, and X-ray
spectra that will provide important constraints on models of the quasar phenomenon.
The UV and optical continuum properties are studied using a set of composite
quasar spectra created from the SDSS quasar catalog. We discovered a dependency of the
continuum shape on both quasar luminosity and redshift, and found that the Baldwin
Effect, in which the equivalent width of an emission line is anti-correlated with the
continuum, applies for most of the broad emission lines. Focusing on the CIV emission
line, we construct a sample which consists of 272 Type 1 AGNs. An analysis of this
sample indicates that the changes of the EWs are controlled by both UV and soft X-ray
emissions, suggesting that the UV and X-ray emissions are closely related.
We show that variability is an important contributor to the scatter of many im-
portant correlations, such as the Baldwin Effect, as well as the quasar spectral energy
distribution (SED) between optical and X-ray. In order to eliminate the influence of
variability, we compiled a catalog of quasars with simultaneous UV, optical and X-ray
observations from the Swift gamma-ray-burst explorer. Using the Swift data, plus the
photometric data from SDSS, we constructed a set of composite quasar SEDs for most
of the objects in our catalog. We use this set of SEDs to constrain the amplitude of
the big blue bump. We also re-visit the lν(2500 Å)-αox relation and demonstrate that
the dispersion of this correlation can be reduced by ∼ 20% using this simultaneously
observed sample.
Quasar intrinsic absorption lines are important diagnoses of the quasar outflow.
Models of intrinsic narrow absorption line systems towards three high redshift quasars
from Keck/HIRES, reveals high ionization levels and super-solar metallicities of these
absorbers, indicating vigorous star formation occurred before the quasars become visible.

Introduction
1.1 AGN Taxonomy and Multiple Wavelength Properties
An active galactic nucleus (AGN) is a compact region at the center of a galaxy,
that is much more energetic than normal galaxies (e.g., the Milky Way) and generates
emissions in multiple wavebands, which cannot be attributed to stars (Peterson 1997;
Fabian 1999a; Kembhavi & Narlikar 1999). A galaxy that hosts an AGN is called an
active galaxy. It is believed that unlike normal galaxies, whose energy is contributed
mainly from stellar nuclear synthesis, the power of an AGN is primarily contributed by
accretion into a super massive black hole (SMBH).
AGNs exhibit distinct features that are not seen in normal galaxies. For example,
an AGN usually has a power-law continuum shape in UV and optical bands with a
number of broad emission lines (e.g., Korista et al. 1995; Veilleux 2002). In X-ray band
(0.3–20 keV), AGNs have a power-law continuum and often a prominent Fe Kα emission
line at ∼ 6.4 keV (e.g., Page et al. 2004b, 2005). Some AGNs have strong emission in
radio (e.g., Laing 1993) and/or infrared band (e.g., Sanders et al. 1989) and numerous
emission and absorption features (e.g., Maiolino & Risaliti 2007; Turnshek 1988).
Based on their observational properties, AGNs can be classified into the following
categories. Because each category is defined based on multiple waveband properties, an
AGN can belong to more than one categories.
• Seyfert galaxies. Seyfert galaxies (Seyfert 1943) are defined based on their relatively
low luminosity (Lbol ∼ 1044 erg s−1) and emission line features at UV and optical
bands. There are two types of Seyfert galaxies depending on the widths of emission
lines. Seyfert 1 galaxies contain both broad (FWHM1 & 1000 km s−1) and narrow
emission lines (FWHM . 1000 km s−1) while Seyfert 2 galaxies only contain narrow
emission lines. There are also intermediate types which are given a fractional type
value depending upon the relative strengths of broad and narrow components (e.g.,
Type 1.5, see Osterbrock & Ferland 2006). A subset of Seyfert 1 galaxies is called
narrow line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxy, which is commonly defined as FWHM(Hβ)<
2000 km s−1 and [O iii] λ5007/Hβ< 3 (Osterbrock & Pogge 1985; Goodrich 1989).
Because of their relatively low luminosity, Seyfert galaxies are currently found at
low redshift (z . 0.5) and have visible host galaxies.
• Radio galaxies. These are galaxies with strong radio emission compared with emis-
sion in other wavebands. The strength of radio emission is usually parameterized
1Full width of half maximum
2
as radio loudness R∗, which is defined as the ratio of monochromatic luminosi-
ties at rest-frame 5 GHz and 2500 Å (e.g., Stocke et al. 1992). Conventionally,
radio quiet (RQ) AGNs are defined as R∗ < 10 while radio loud (RL) AGNs are
defined as R∗ > 10. It is estimated that ∼ 10% of AGNs are RL (Kellermann
et al. 1989). Most radio galaxies are compact (i.e., unresolved at ∼ 1′′ resolution),
but it is estimated that ∼ 10% are extended sources (Lu et al. 2007). Due to the
sensitivity limits of radio telescopes, most known radio galaxies are at low redshift
(z . 1). Radio galaxies can be optically faint or bright. X-ray emission is usually
associated with strong radio emission from the jet (Worrall & Birkinshaw 2006;
Gelbord et al. 2008). In general, for a given optical luminosity, the X-ray emission
from RL quasars is about three times greater than that from their RQ counterparts
(Zamorani et al. 1981; Worrall et al. 1987).
• Quasars. Quasars are the most luminous AGNs with Lbol & 1046 erg s−1. In most
UV and optical sky images, quasars are point-like sources. Spectroscopically, they
exhibit similar features as Seyfert 1 galaxies with prominent Lyα emission lines
and/or other broad emission lines, but with little contribution from host galaxies.
The UV and optical spectra of quasars can also exhibit broad absorption lines
(BALs) with FWHM between 2,000 km s−1 and 25,000 km s−1 (Greenstein &
Schmidt 1964; Schmidt 1969; Weymann et al. 1991; Trump et al. 2006; Gibson
et al. 2009). Besides BALs, there are also narrow absorption lines (NALs). NALs
are produced by intervening absorbers such as molecular clouds, interstellar or
intergalactic medium (e.g., Ding et al. 2003, 2005; Jones et al. 2010), or by intrinsic
absorbers, which are physically associated with the AGN (e.g., Ganguly et al. 1999,
2001; Wu et al. 2010). Similar to Seyfert 2 galaxies, highly obscured quasars are
called Type 2 quasars, which are characterized by narrow emission lines in the
UV/optical spectra (Zakamska et al. 2003) and/or strong absorption in X-ray band.
• BL Lac objects. In general, AGNs show continuum and emission line variability at
all wavelengths at which they have been observed (e.g., Matthews & Sandage 1963;
Schmidt 1969; Uttley & Mchardy 2004), from X-ray to radio. A small fraction of
AGNs, called BL Lac objects are distinguished by short time-scale variations that
are abnormally large (e.g., Burbidge & Hewitt 1992; Wagner & Witzel 1995; Rani
et al. 2010). Associated with this large variations are high polarizations (e.g., Fan
et al. 2007; Smith et al. 2007), strong radio emission, and absence of emission lines
in their UV/optical spectra. Many of them are RL and their emission is found to
be relativistically beamed from the jets and non-thermal (Urry & Padovani 1995).
• LINERs (low-ionization nuclear emission regions). They are weak AGNs with
bolometric luminosity less than 1044 erg s−1(Heckman 1980). Seyferts are on av-
erage 10 times more luminous than LINERs (Ho 2003). The defining characteris-
tics of LINERs are the relative intensities of their oxygen emission lines, namely
[O ii] λ3727/[O iii] λ5007> 1 and [O i] λ6300/[O iii] λ5007> 1/3 (Eracleous et al.
2010). Although the spectra of LINERs resembles Seyfert 2 galaxies and H ii re-
gions, the two classes can be distinguished by considering the intensity ratios of
two pairs of lines, e.g., [O iii] λ5007/Hβ vs. [N ii] λ6583/Hα, which is known
3
as the “BPT” diagram (Baldwin et al. 1981; Veilleux & Osterbrock 1987). Pi-
oneering work estimated that at least 1/3 of all the spiral galaxies are LINERs
(Ho 1996). The energy source powering LINERs remains a subject of debate. It
could be a low-luminosity AGN (e.g., González-Mart́ın et al. 2006; Flohic et al.
2006; Eracleous et al. 2010), massive star formation (e.g., Barth & Shields 2000),
shock heating mechanism resulting from massive star formation (e.g., Dopita &
Sutherland 1995), or some combination of the above.
• Ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). These galaxies have extremely high
infrared (IR) luminosity, typically LIR > 10
12L⊙. Spectroscopically, they exhibit
both black hole accretion and starburst signatures. Current models of ULIRGs
suggest that they are powered by both starburst and AGN activity triggered by
collision of gas-rich galaxies (Sanders & Mirabel 1996; Lonsdale et al. 2006; Hou
et al. 2009).
There are other sub-types of AGNs, such as broad line radio galaxies (BLRG, which is
a subset of radio galaxies, see Leighly et al. 1997 for an example), broad line Seyfert 1
(e.g., Vanden Berk et al. 2006), steep spectrum radio quasar (SSRQ, see Bicknell et al.
1997 for an example) and flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ, which is a subset of blazars,
see Sambruna et al. 1996). In this thesis, we focus our research on quasars and, if not
specified, we mean RQ Type 1 quasars.
1.2 Unified Quasar Structure
It is believed that objects in the various classes above can be described by a
unification model (e.g., Gopal-Krishna et al. 1994; Falcke et al. 1995; Antonucci 1993;
Vagnetti & Spera 1994; Lister et al. 1994; Maraschi & Rovetti 1994; Urry & Padovani
1995; Kauffmann & Haehnelt 2000; Lacy 2003; Hopkins et al. 2006; Richards et al. 2011).
In this scheme, different types of AGNs have the same (or similar) structure, but appear
to be different because of orientation effect, i.e., observers are examining different regions
from different viewing angles, and the existence of jets. In general, an AGN consists of
the following components (Figure 1.2).
• A central black hole. It is believed that black holes exist at the centers of all
massive galaxies (Ho 1999), and the black hole growth is deterministic to AGN
structure and evolution (e.g., Marconi et al. 2004). The black hole is rotating
(e.g., Wang et al. 2006; Nemmen et al. 2007; Ballantyne 2010) and is accreting
surrounding materials. The black hole mass MBH and the accretion rate ṀBH are
two important parameters that drive AGN phenomena. The black hole mass ranges
from 106 to 1010 M⊙(Urry 2004). In general, more luminous AGNs have more
massive black holes (Blandford & McKee 1982; Peterson 1993; Peterson et al. 2004).
Therefore, quasars host the most massive black holes with 107M⊙ < MBH < 10
9M⊙
(e.g., Hopkins & Hernquist 2009). Black holes of Seyfert galaxies have masses of
MBH ∼ 106 M⊙ (e.g., Denney et al. 2010). If LINERs are powered by AGNs, they
host the least massive black holes of the entire AGN family with MBH . 10
6 M⊙.
4
• An accretion disk. Material surrounding the central black hole, because of loss of
angular momentum (Begelman 1985), forms a geometrically thin disk (Peterson
1997; Frank et al. 1992) around the black hole. The accretion disk is the main
producer of UV photons (Treves et al. 1988; Armitage 2004). In addition, a corona
of hot materials forms above the accretion disk (Poutanen 1998). UV photons
generated from the accretion disk can be boosted to X-ray photons via inverse-
Compton scattering inside the corona (Reynolds & Nowak 2003).
Because of the quasar outflow which originates from the accretion disk (the ac-
cretion disk wind; e.g., Gallagher et al. 2002b; Brandt & Kaspi 2002; Chartas
et al. 2009a). Radiation from the accretion disk can thus be shielded or obscured
by these outflowing gases, and line/continuum absorptions are seen in UV/optical
and/or even X-ray spectra (e.g., Mathur et al. 1995; Reynolds 1997; Giustini et al.
2010; Brandt et al. 2000). These outflows provide feedbacks to AGN host galaxies
during the growth of the SMBH in galactic bulges (e.g., Fabian 1999b; Saez et al.
2009). The narrow and broad absorption lines also provide important insights into
the dynamics, structure, ionization and metallicity of outflows (e.g., Hamann 1997;
Ganguly et al. 2001; Hamann et al. 2002; Hamann & Sabra 2004; Misawa et al.
2007; Ganguly & Brotherton 2008; Wu et al. 2010).
• Broad emission line region (BELR or BLR). The BLR surrounding the accretion
disk is where the UV/optical broad emission lines in quasar spectra are gener-
ated (see reviews by Sulentic, Marziani & dultzin-Hacyan, 2000). The lines are
broadened both because of both thermal and bulk motion of gases. The electron
density of this region is typically 1010–1011 cm−3 (Ferland et al. 1992; Peterson
1997). Because the BLR electron densities are sufficiently high that virtually all
forbidden lines are collisionally suppressed, there are no simple temperature and
density diagnostics for the this region. It is traditionally believed that the BLR
consists of discrete spherically distributed clouds (e.g., Urry 2004; Peterson 1997).
However, recent quasar spectral studies of the double-peaked broad line profiles
suggest flattening and inclination within the structure of the BLR (e.g., Eracleous
2004; La Mura et al. 2009; Gaskell 2009).
• Narrow line region (NLR). The NLR is outside the BLR and can extend far beyond
the host galaxy. Ground-based observations (e.g., Pogge 1989) and subsequent
images obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST ; Schmitt & Kinney 1996)
reveal that the NLRs in many Seyferts exhibit a bi-conical structure (Kraemer
et al. 2011). The electron density in this region is low enough that forbidden and
semi-forbidden lines are produced.
• Jets. Jets are not seen in all AGNs. They are usually associated with RL objects,
but even in RL quasars jets are not always present. Jets are believed to be per-
pendicular to the plane of the accretion disk and can extend from the black hole to
well beyond the NLR. Jets are rarely visible in UV/optical band, but have strong
radio and X-ray emission due to synchrotron radiation (Worrall 2009). Depend-
ing on jet shapes, radio quasars are classified as FR 1 and FR 2 (Fanaroff & Riley
1974). FR i sources are weaker radio sources which are brightest in the center, with
5
decreasing surface brightness towards the edges. In contrast, the more luminous
FR ii sources are limb-brightened, and often show regions of enhanced emission
either at the edge of the radio structure or embedded within the structure. Radio
jets from AGNs are thought be an important form of AGN feedback, which can
quench star formation and reduce the number of supernova whose progenitors are
massive stars (e.g., Vernaleo & Reynolds 2006).
In addition, quasars have host galaxies. Quasars can provide feedback to their host
galaxies in forms of outflows and affect their metallicity, star formation rates, and gas
fractions. Observationally, host galaxies are usually blended with quasar emission in
optical band, while in UV band the galaxy contribution is relatively less. In nearby
Seyfert galaxies, AGN host galaxies are visible and could be resolved in some cases.
Host galaxies of quasars are usually not visible because the emission from the nuclei
vastly outshines the stellar light. In quasar spectra, narrow Ca ii absorption lines are
usually used to identify the contribution from host galaxies. (e.g., Bennert et al. 2011).
The spectral decomposition technique can be used to separate host galaxy component
from the AGN components (e.g., Vanden Berk et al. 2006; Shen et al. 2008a).
1.3 Quasar Surveys
There have been many multi-waveband surveys targeting at finding and observing
quasars since they are discovered in the 1960s. We summarize three surveys that are
related to this thesis study.
• 3C radio survey. The Third Cambridge Catalogue of Radio Sources (3C) is a
compilation of radio sources detected originally at 159 MHz (Edge et al. 1959).
It contains 471 sources with a flux limit of 8 Jansky (Jy). Subsequently, Bennett
(1962) created a revised version of the 3C at 178 MHz, formally named as 3CR,
which contains 328 sources with a flux limit of 9 Jy. This catalog was further
revised by Laing et al. (1983) and 25% of the entries are optically identified as
quasars. Subsequent similar radio surveys include PKS survey (Ekers 1969), 4C
(Pilkington & Scott 1965; Gower et al. 1967), until 9C (Waldram et al. 2003).
Quasars in these “C” catalogs are, of course, strong radio sources.
• Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The SDSS uses a dedicated 2.5-meter telescope
located at Apache Point Observatory, New Mexico, to obtain images in five bands
(ugriz; Fukugita et al. 1996) over approximately 10,000 deg2 of high Galactic
latitude sky. The survey also obtains spectra from ∼ 3800 Å to ∼ 9200 Å at a
spectral resolution of ≃ 2000 (York et al. 2000). Between 2000 and 2008 (the Sloan
Legacy Survey), the SDSS imaged over 11,600 deg2 of sky and obtained spectra of
galaxies and quasars from 9,380 deg2 of that imaging. There are in total seven data
releases (Stoughton et al. 2002; Abazajian et al. 2003, 2005; Adelman-McCarthy
et al. 2006, 2007, 2008; Abazajian et al. 2009) and five editions of quasar catalogs
(Schneider et al. 2002, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2010). The latest catalog contains 105,783
spectroscopically confirmed quasars with absolute luminosities Mi ≤ −22.0 and
highly reliable redshifts.
6
• The Very Large Array (VLA) Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-cm (FIRST)
Survey was designed to produce the radio equivalent of the Palomar Observatory
Sky Survey over 9,900 deg2 of the North Galactic Gap (Becker et al. 1995), corre-
sponding to the sky regions covered by SDSS. The survey uses the National Radio
Astronomy Observatory VLA in its B-configuration to acquire snapshots centered
at ∼ 1.4 GHz. This survey, with flux density sensitivity of ∼ 1 mJy, is much deeper
than the C series radio surveys. The FIRST radio data are used to select quasars
in the SDSS quasar catalogs; unresolved objects brighter than i = 19.1 that lie
within 2.0′′ are identified as primary quasar candidates (Richards et al. 2002b).
The 20 cm peak flux density (encoded as an AB magnitude) is recorded in the
SDSS data release 7 (DR7) quasar catalog (Schneider et al. 2010).
1.4 Unified Themes and Organizations of This Thesis
The quasar SED covers a wide range of the electro-magnetic spectrum (Wilkes
2004; Figure 1.1). The main theme of this thesis is to provide observational constraints
of quasars in the rest-frame UV/optical and X-ray bands using both spectroscopic and
photometric observations. These constraints include the continuum shape, (e.g., Vanden
Berk et al. 2011, in preparation), spectral energy distribution (SED; e.g., Wu et al. 2011,
in preparation), and important continuum and line correlations (e.g., Wu et al. 2009).
These relationships provide deep insights into the structure and physical conditions of
quasars (e.g., Wu et al. 2010).
1.4.1 UV/Optical Emission
A composite quasar spectrum from the SDSS is presented in Figure 1.3 (Vanden
Berk et al. 2001). This spectrum represents the “canonical” shape of a quasar spectrum
in UV/optical bands. It contains a UV power-law continuum from Lyα to ∼ 5600 Å,
and an optical power-law from ∼ 5600 Å to & 8000 Å with a shallower slope. Through
out this thesis, unless we specify the continuum waveband, we refer to the rest-frame
UV continuum by default. This component is formed by the thermal emission on the
accretion disk (Peterson 1997). The UV power-law shape reflects the thermal status of
the accretion disk which is affected by the accretion process (Treves et al. 1988; Frank
et al. 1992). The observed spectral slope αλ can be shallower or even positive due to
reddening effects (e.g., Richards 2001; Richards et al. 2003). Changes of spectral slopes
over redshift provide information on the quasar evolution, and changes of spectral slopes
over luminosity reveal differential accretion process from faint to bright quasars as well
as insights into the fundamental parameter that controls the accretion process.
AGN spectra usually contain a set of prominent narrow and broad emission lines.
Permitted lines such as Lyα, C iv, Mg ii, Hα and Hβ are usually broad with FWHM &
1000 km s−1. Semi-forbidden lines can be broad (e.g., C iii] 1908) or narrow (e.g.,
Al ii] 2669). Forbidden lines such as [Ne v 3346], [O iii 5008] and [N ii 6549] are usually
narrow with FWHM . 1000 km s−1. These lines cannot be formed in the BLR because
the high density in this region well exceeds the critical densities.
7
Some broad emission lines, such as C iv, exhibit notable “emission line shifts”,
i.e., blue-shift with respect to the quasar’s rest-frame (Gaskell 1982; Wilkes 1986; Espey
et al. 1989; Zheng & Sulentic 1990; Corbin 1990; Weymann et al. 1991; Tytler & Fan
1992; Brotherton et al. 1994; Laor et al. 1995; McIntosh et al. 1999; Vanden Berk et al.
2001; Richards et al. 2002a). This phenomenon indicates that the broad emission line
gases are involved or associated with the quasar outflow (Richards et al. 2002a, 2011).
Narrow emission lines exhibit little or no shift because they are created at considerable
distance from the accretion disk and are much less influenced by quasar outflow. Some
lines, such as Hβ, can be decomposed of a broad and a narrow component; their central
wavelengths can be offset because they are formed in different regions. The correlation
between emission line shifts and the ionization potentials of the ions (e.g., Tytler & Fan
1992; McIntosh et al. 1999; Vanden Berk et al. 2001) implies a stratified BLR structure.
In some cases, a small enhancement between 2000 Å and 4000 Å is seen in a
quasar spectrum which is conventionally named the 3000 Å bump (Grandi 1982; Oke
et al. 1984). The exact origin of this component is not well understood, and it should
primarily be comprised of Balmer line complex and a thermal emission component it
must be taken into consideration in spectral fitting.
Absorption, especially intrinsic absorption, is very useful in diagnosing physical
conditions of outflowing materials driven by the ionization flux from the background
continuum source as well as the broad line emitters (e.g., Hamann & Ferland 1999).
Broad absorption lines (FWHM & 500 km s−1) are produced when the line-of-sight
passes along the outflow and thus frequently have large ejection velocities. Strong broad
absorption in UV is usually associated with X-ray weakness, which is in agreement with
the models in which the strong X-ray absorption shields the outflow from over-ionization
and enable radiative acceleration (e.g., Gibson et al. 2009). Narrow absorption lines
(NAL) could be either intervening (e.g., Rauch 1998; Churchill et al. 2000; Charlton
2003; Ding et al. 2003) or intrinsic (e.g., Foltz et al. 1986; Hamann et al. 1997; Crenshaw
et al. 1998; Misawa et al. 2007). If determined to be intrinsic, the NALs allow one to
separate each individual absorption line doublet, and to build models that probe the
physical conditions of intrinsic absorbers, including the outflow velocity, metallicity, and
ionization status. For high redshift quasars z ∼ 3, these modeling results are informative
on the evolutionary phases of quasars in the early universe in terms of the star formation
and accretion activity.
Although the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and infrared (IR) are not the focus of
this thesis, for completeness, we present a brief summary. The EUV region on the blue
side of Lyα suffers from severe intrinsic (from quasar) and intervening (from interstellar
medium) absorptions. It is extremely difficult to determine the true continuum due to
these absorptions. The emission lines (e.g., Ovi λ1032) are usually strongly affected
by absorption and the intrinsic absorption lines are usually blended with Lyα forest
lines. For z & 6 quasars, the absorption is so strong that it forms the “Gunn-Peterson
Trough” (Gunn & Peterson 1965; also see Fan et al. 2001,2003,2004,2006). The near
infrared (IR) and mid IR spectra of AGNs (e.g., Weedman et al. 2005) are characterized
by diversity, such as strong silicon absorption (Mrk 231, and Cen A), strong silicon
emission (i ZW 1 and NGC 1275), and strong PAH emissions. The IR emission is
8
produced via the radiative transfer in the torus (Nenkova et al. 2008). The EUV and IR
spectral regions are not the focus of the thesis.
1.4.2 X-ray Emission
Quasar X-ray emission is relatively simpler than the UV band. The spectrum
features a power-law with an average power-law photon index Γ ≈ 2 (e.g., Young et al.
2009). This X-ray continuum is a result of inverse comptonization of UV photons pro-
duced from the inner part of the hot accretion disk (Longair 1994). At ∼ 6.4 keV is
the Fe Kα line (Reynolds & Nowak 2003); because of its high fluorescent yield and large
cosmic abundance, it is the strongest emission line appearing in the X-ray band. Al-
though intrinsically narrow, the iron lines are broadened by Doppler shifts and strong
gravitational effects (Krolik & Kallman 1987; Fabian et al. 2000).
X-ray and UV emission for a given quasar are correlated (Tananbaum et al. 1979;
Zamorani et al. 1981; Vignali et al. 2003; Strateva et al. 2005; Steffen et al. 2006; Just
et al. 2007). Namely, a non-BAL RQ quasar bright in UV (represented by flux at 2500 Å)
is very likely to be bright in X-ray band as well (Gibson et al. 2008). The C iv and Fe Kα
line flux are also positively correlated (Wu et al. 2009).
In addition, there is a soft X-ray excess discovered below ∼ 0.5 keV (e.g., Arnaud
et al. 1985; Page et al. 2004b), which is believed to be a thermal component at a constant
temperature over a wide range of AGN properties (Crummy et al. 2006).
X-ray absorption, primarily caused by photoelectric effect, is almost always seen
in X-ray spectra of quasars. This continuum absorption weakens the X-ray flux and
causes a quick decay towards soft-X-ray band. Neutral hydrogen absorption causes
an exponential decay in form of fν ∝ ν1−Γ exp
[
−(hν/kT )−8/3
]
(Longair 1992). In
most cases, the Galactic absorption dominates, but intrinsic X-ray absorption can be
significant (see Chapter 4).
X-ray and UV absorption are also correlated (e.g., Brandt et al. 2000). Partic-
ularly, BAL quasars are also commonly detected to be X-ray weak as a result of high
intrinsic column densities (NH) typically in range of (1–50)× 1022 cm−2 (e.g., Gallagher
et al. 2002a, 2006; Saez et al. 2009).
Because X-ray photons are produced closer to the black hole than UV photons,
investigating quasars in X-ray allows us to examine the physical processes closer to the
central engine than UV/optical radiation. The X-ray-UV connection indicates that the
UV and X-ray emission regions should be considered jointly. If quasars are similar and
then spectra are remarkably so scalable, there should be a few fundamental parameters,
such as the black hole mass MBH or the accretion rate ṀBH , that drive the entire central
engine and many of the phenomena we observe.
1.4.3 Thesis Organization
The thesis is organized as follows. In the next chapter, we study the average
quasar spectral properties as functions of redshift and luminosity using a set of com-
posite quasar spectra. In Chapter 3, we focus on the Baldwin Effect using a sample of
272 RQ Type 1 AGNs and quasars. In Chapter 4, we utilize simultaneous UV/optical
9
and X-ray observations from Swift Gamma-ray Explorer (here after Swift) to create a
quasar catalog. We attempt to constrain the bolometric luminosity and re-visit the αox-
lν(2500 Å) relation using a “clean” sample selected from this catalog. In Chapter 5,
we turn our attention to absorption lines. By modeling intrinsic NAL systems of three
quasars, we attempt to understand the physical conditions of the intrinsic absorbers
of quasars at high redshift. Through out this paper, we adopt the same cosmology as
the SDSS quasar catalog (Schneider et al. 2010), assuming an H0 = 70 km s
−1 Mpc−1,
ΩM = 0.3, and ΩΛ = 0.7.

types of AGNs are due to line-of-sight effects. Blazars are those AGNs for which the
jets are close to line of sight. A regular quasar or a Seyfert 1 galaxy is observed if the
orientation angle is ∼ 30◦, where the narrow line and broad line regions are visible. At
larger angular offsets, the BLR will be hidden by torus, the corresponding class being
Seyfert 2 galaxies. Perpendicular to the jet axis, the full extent of the jets may be seen
particular at low frequencies, giving rise to a morphology typical radio galaxies.

Chapter 2
Continuum and Emission Line Properties of
Composite Quasar Spectra from SDSS
2.1 Introduction
Two of the most fundamental parameters for any class of extragalactic objects are
redshift and luminosity. Redshift provides an estimate of the distances to the objects, as
well as the age of the universe at the time the observed light was emitted. Luminosity is
directly related to the energy generation mechanism of the objects. Empirically derived
parameters from observations of the objects may change with either redshift or luminos-
ity, providing information about the evolution of the population over cosmic time, and
the changes that occur when the energy output varies.
There are several observable UV/optical quasar parameters that are known to
correlate with luminosity. These include an anti-correlation of emission line equivalent
width with ultraviolet continuum luminosity (known as the Baldwin effect; Baldwin 1977;
see also, e.g., Wu et al. 2009; Richards et al. 2010), shifts of emission positions relative
to systemic positions (e.g., Gaskell 1982; Tytler & Fan 1992; Richards et al. 2002a), UV
spectral slope, optical/UV variability amplitude (e.g. Vanden Berk et al. 2004), and the
relative amplitudes of eigenspectra reconstructions of quasar spectra (Yip et al. 2004).
Many of these parameters appear observationally to be related to one another (e.g.
Richards et al. 2011). Including X-ray observations, there is also an anti-correlation
between the ultraviolet 2500Å continuum luminosity and its strength relative to the
2 keV X-ray luminosity – the so-called αox-lν(2500 Å) relation (e.g. Avni & Tananbaum
1982; Just et al. 2007).
In contrast, a number of important quasar parameters, such as metallicity of the
broad line region, do not appear to depend upon redshift (e.g. Hamann & Ferland 1999;
Jiang et al. 2007; Juarez et al. 2009). However, as a population, the luminosity function
of quasars evolves strongly over cosmic time (e.g. Schmidt 1968, 1970; Schmidt & Green
1983; Croom et al. 2009), and it may be expected that some global spectral properties
of quasars evolve over time as well.
The large sample of quasars from the SDSS spans a wide range of luminosity
and redshift, and allows the isolation of the dependence of quasar properties on both
parameters. Statistical properties of quasars in small bins of luminosity and redshift
can be determined with high precision. In this study, we examine a number of ensemble
quasar properties, including spectral slope, emission line equivalent width, and emission
line shifts, as a function of both luminosity and redshift.
In this work, we construct a set of composite quasar spectra from the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS; York et al. 2000) Data Release 3 quasar catalog (DR3; Schneider
et al. 2005) to study the changes of spectral parameters as functions of redshift and
14
luminosity. We follow the method to construct the composite spectra as described by
Vanden Berk et al. (2001), who constructed only a single quasar spectrum based on 2200
spectra from SDSS early data release (Stoughton et al. 2002).
The SDSS used a dedicated 2.5-meter telescope located at Apache Point Obser-
vatory, New Mexico, to obtain images in five bands (ugriz ; Fukugita et al. 1996) over
approximately 10,000 deg2 of high Galactic latitude sky. The survey also obtains spectra
from ∼ 3800 Å to ∼ 9200 Å at a spectral resolution of ≈ 2000 (York et al. 2000). The
DR3 quasar catalog consists of 46,420 objects in the SDSS DR3 that have luminosities
larger than Mi = −22. The quasar redshifts range from 0.08 to 5.41. The rest-frame
wavelength in the SDSS spectra ranges from ∼ 610 Å to ∼ 9000 Å. We These data were
used to construct 186 composite spectra.
An updated work, which is based on the SDSS DR7 quasar catalog (Schneider
et al. 2010), is in progress. Because the number of quasars in DR7 is over twice that
quasars in DR3, the number of quasars per composite increases (see the new luminosity-
redshift binning diagram in Figure 2.3). This improves the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) for
each composite spectrum. Although the total number of bins increases as well, this does
not provide a significant number of new bins with high-quality spectra. Most new quasar
spectra are of intermediate luminosity and fractions of faint and very luminous quasars
are small. In addition, bins with very few (typically less than 20) quasar spectra are
dropped because of low S/N . As a result, the new quasar catalog does not significantly
extend the redshift and luminosity ranges. However, a preliminary study of the DR7
composite spectra indicates that the general trends of spectral parameter do not change.
Therefore, in this work, we present our work based on the DR3 quasar catalog. The
work based on the DR7 quasar catalog will form the basis of the published study.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2.2, we introduce the methods and
procedures to generate the composite spectrum set; in Section 2.3, we fit the quasar
spectra using our custom software package QSFIT ; in Section 2.4, we study the spectral
properties in terms of spectral parameters as functions of luminosity and redshift; In
Section 2.6, we present our conclusions. Throughout this paper, we apply the following
cosmological parameters: ΩM = 0.3, ΩΛ = 0.7, H0 = 70 km s
−1 Mpc−1.
2.2 Generating the Composite Spectra
The quasar sample is drawn from the SDSS DR3 quasar catalog (Schneider et al.
2007) and the spectra of those quasars were taken from the SDSS data release 5 (DR5)
database. Not all of the quasars from the catalog should be used for this study, since the
continuum shapes and emission lines of the sample can depend upon quantities other
than redshift and luminosity, but those quantities may not be representatively sampled
due to observing limitations. For example, quasars selected solely by their X-ray flux in
the ROSAT All Sky Survey (Voges et al. 1999, 2000) should not be included, because
those quasars are detected almost exclusively at low redshift, and their high-redshift
counterparts are not represented in the SDSS quasar catalog. Any unique redshift or
luminosity dependence of quasar spectral properties in such X-ray selected quasars could
impart artificial trends on the larger sample. Therefore, only quasars selected as can-
didates by their optical colors were included in the sample. X-ray or radio selected
15
quasars were included only if they could also have been selected by their optical colors
(see Richards et al. 2002b for description of SDSS quasar target selection).
Quasars with broad absorption line systems (BALQSOs) were also excluded from
the sample. BALQSOs are statistically redder than their non-BAL counterparts (e.g.
Weymann et al. 1991), likely due to reddening by the absorber material (e.g. Reichard
et al. 2003). Also, measurement of the continuum luminosities of BAL quasars is prob-
lematic because the continuum is often heavily attenuated by absorption lines (e.g. Hall
et al. 2002). All quasars identified in the SDSS DR5 BALQSO catalog of Gibson et al.
(2009) were therefore excluded from the sample. Applying the X-ray/radio/BALQSO
exclusion criteria to the DR3 quasar catalog produced of sample of 44,969 that was used
to construct our composite spectra.
The spectra of individual quasars were shifted into their rest frames by dividing
the observed wavelengths by 1 + z, then were re-binned onto a common wavelength
scale by extending the SDSS wavelength scale to shorter wavelengths. The individual
spectral pixels of rest wavelength and flux density fλ were re-binned onto the common
wavelength scale using cubic spline interpolation. The same procedure was applied to
the error arrays of each spectrum.
Quasar redshift is not an unambiguous quantity, because the value of the redshift
frequently depends upon the emission line used for the measurement (e.g., Richards et al.
2002a). The redshift differences imply relative emission line velocity shifts that can be as
high as hundreds of km s−1. One of the goals of this study is to determine how relative
velocity shifts are related to other quantities. Therefore, we have measured multiple
redshifts for each quasar based on a number of strong lines: Hβ, Mg ii λ2798, and
C iv λ1549. The SDSS spectrum of every quasar with a redshift less than 4.9 will cover
at least one of those lines. The wavelength at the peak of an emission line was determined
by fitting a region around the line with a set of quasar eigenspectra generated by Yip
et al. (2004). The wavelength at the peak flux density of the fit was taken to be the
wavelength of the emission line, and used to determine the emission line redshift. When
the composite spectra were constructed, for each set of spectra to be combined, only the
redshifts based upon the same single emission line were used. The Hβ redshifts were
used for 0.0000 < z ≤ 0.7378, the Mg ii redshifts were used for 0.7378 < z ≤ 1.7542, and
the C iv redshifts were used for 1.7542 < z ≤ 4.2481. The use of a single emission line
for redshifts allows the emission line velocity shifts of every other line in the composite
spectrum to be determined relative to the same line.
Recent work by Hewett & Wild (2010) systematically investigate the relation-
ship between different redshift estimation schemes for more than 91,000 quasars in the
SDSS DR6 (Adelman-McCarthy et al. 2008). Using a cross-correlation technique with a
master-quasar template, they achieved a redshift accuracy down of ∆z/(1 + z) ≤ 10−4
(30 km s−1) per unit redshift. They presented the consistency of redshifts using their
methods and the redshifts determined by Hβ and Mg ii λ2798 centroid, and the system-
atic redshift biases when measuring redshifts using C iv λ1549 (e.g., Figure 9 of their
paper). The emission line shift study of our work focuses on the relative shifts with
respect to reference lines. The redshift values of our composites are based on the eigen-
spectrum technique and can achieve at least comparable accuracy with that of the SDSS
spectroscopic pipeline (∆z/(1 + z) . 0.002), or even better, which is sufficient to study
16
emission line shift trends. For quasars with redshifts greater than 4.25, the SDSS quasar
catalog redshift was used when generating the composite spectra. In most of those high-
redshift cases, the C iv emission line is either not covered by the spectrum, very weak,
or contaminated by night sky line residuals. The high-redshift spectra usually also lack
any other strong and unabsorbed emission lines, so emission line shifts measured from
the composite spectra of those high-redshift quasars will be quite uncertain.
In order to compare the properties of quasars as a function of luminosity, a con-
sistent measurement of luminosity is required. This is difficult to achieve for quasars,
since the continuum is heavily contaminated with emission lines at most wavelengths,
and a fixed observed frame wavelength window covers different rest frame wavelength
ranges at different redshifts. We have selected the specific luminosity at 2200 Å as the
common luminosity measure for our study for the following reasons: 1) the rest frame
2200 Å wavelength is directly accessible in almost 80% of the quasar spectra. 2) the
region near 2200 Å is relatively free of contaminating emission lines – at this wavelength
blended iron emission lines contributes only approximately 5% to the total quasar spe-
cific luminosity. 3) 2200 Å is close to 2500 Å, which is a wavelength at which quasar
specific luminosities are often measured (e.g., Vignali et al. 2003; Strateva et al. 2005),
although at this wavelength the continuum is sufficiently more heavily contaminated by
emission lines.
When accessible, the flux density at the rest frame 2200 Å wavelength was mea-
sured directly. For each spectrum this was performed by finding the median flux density
value of the dereddened spectrum for all the pixels within the wavelength range 2160–
2240 Å. When the 2200 Å region was not accessible, scaled measurements of the specific
luminosity at other continuum wavelengths were used instead. The scale factors were
determined by finding the average ratio of the specific luminosities at a set of continuum
wavelength to the specific luminosities at 2200 Å, determined from quasars for which
both continuum regions were accessible. The other continuum wavelengths used were
5100 Å for redshifts less than 0.77, 1450 Å for redshifts between 3.09 and 5.13, and
1350 Å for redshifts greater than 5.13. The specific luminosity scale factors in each case
are 4.427 (λ = 5100 Å), 0.542 (λ = 1450 Å), and 0.481 (λ = 1350 Å).
In Figure 2.1, we plot the 2200 Å luminosity vs. monochromatic power-law contin-
uum luminosities at 5100 Å, 3000 Å, and 1450 Å for all composite spectra. The panel at
bottom right plots lλ (3000 Å) vs. lλ (5100 Å), which are also strongly correlated. These
wavelengths are often used in black hole mass estimators as benchmark wavelengths to
calculate bolometric luminosities (e.g., Shen et al. 2008b). The tight linear correlations
in all panels indicate that it is reasonable to use these luminosities to represent quasar
brightness.
The sample we used to generate the composite spectrum set is comprised of 44,969
quasars. The redshift of the sample ranges from 0.06 to ∼ 5.41 and the luminosity range
is 39.30 < log lλ < 44.26
1. All of the spectra, including the flux density and error
array components, were corrected for Galactic extinction using the reddening map con-
structed by Schlegel et al. (1998) and the average Milky Way extinction curve described
by Fitzpatrick (1999).
1In the following paragraphs, unless specified, we use log lλ to represent log lλ(2200 Å).
17
The quasar sample was divided into small redshift and luminosity bins to construct
the composite spectra. The redshift bin limits were set at equal logarithmic intervals,
∆ log(1 + z) = 0.04, beginning at z = 0. The logarithmic spacing makes each redshift
interval roughly equivalent to a constant interval of cosmological time up to the highest
redshifts in the sample. The luminosity density bin limits were set at equal intervals of
∆ log lλ = 0.25. The redshift and luminosity bin sizes were selected to be small enough
that there is little difference in the composite spectral properties in adjacent bins, but
sufficiently large to contain a statistically meaningful number of spectra in bins at the
sample limits. A plot of the number of quasars in each of the redshift-luminosity bins is
shown in Fig. 2.2; 186 bins are populated (Figure 2.3 shows the distribution for the DR7
quasars).
The spectra of the quasars in each redshift-luminosity bin were combined to form
a single composite spectrum for each bin. There are a number of ways of combining spec-
tra into composites, depending upon their intended use. To investigate the continuum
spectral shape of quasars, the geometric mean is an appropriate statistic as the contin-
uum spectra of most quasars is well-described by a power law with an index particular to
each quasar. The geometric mean of a sample of power law spectra will result in a power
law spectrum with the mean index of the sample. This result will not necessarily be true
for the arithmetic mean of the same sample. For analysis of composite emission lines,
the arithmetic mean of the sample preserves the average flux and equivalent width of
the emission lines in the sample. Both geometric mean and arithmetic mean composite
spectra were constructed for each redshift-luminosity bin.
The SDSS spectroscopic pipeline flags spectroscopic pixels that are potentially un-
reliable (Stoughton et al. 2002). The flags are given as a binary mask array in the primary
header and data unit of the spectra. Some flags indicate more serious problems than oth-
ers. By inspection of a large number of individual spectra, and examination of results of
composite spectrum construction, we have identified a set of flags that should cause the
rejection of a pixel for the construction of composite spectra. These flags are (each pre-
ceded by ‘SP MASK ’): NOPLUG, BADTRACE, BADFLAT, BADARC, LOWFLAT,
FULLREJECT, SCATLIGHT, BRIGHTSKY, NODATA, COMBINEREJ, BADFLUX-
FACTOR, BADSKYCHI, and REDMONSTER. In addition, pixels were masked from
composite construction if their flux density values are unrealistically negative, defined
here as fλ < −5σλ; most of these pixels are also rejected based on the mask array flags.
Pixels at the location of strong, narrow absorption lines — except those in the
Lyα forest — were also excluded, since these locations do not represent the underlying
flux of the quasar itself. Correction for the effects of the Lyα forest have not been made
in this study, so any attempt to measure quasar intrinsic properties from the composite
spectra below 1216 Å is unreliable. Absorption line features were identified by finding
sets of at least three contiguous pixels that fall below the local continuum of a quasar
by at least the 95% confidence level. The continuum of a spectrum was estimated by
smoothing the spectrum with a low-pass Fourier transform filter between the peaks of
the major emission lines. The 95% lower confidence limit was found from the distribution
of the flux density differences.
This procedure is intended to be fast (since it must be applied to all of the spectra),
but it is not designed to identify all of the statistically significant absorption features.
18
Comparison between the results of this procedure and those of a much more thorough
algorithm show that the vast majority of the obvious absorption features are detected
by our adopted method.
Host galaxy spectra were not removed from individual spectra before combin-
ing. This approach was adopted because the host galaxy estimates are less reliable for
spectra with lower S/N , such as is the case with many individual spectra. Eigenspec-
trum fitting is sufficiently reliable to estimate the luminosity bin of individual quasars,
but often lacks the required accuracy for determining the overall host galaxy spectrum
shapes (Shen et al. 2008a). The resulting S/N of the composites is usually high enough
that a reasonable mean host galaxy spectrum can be estimated and removed, at least
at redshifts of z < 0.7 (Shen et al. 2008a). Retaining the host galaxy components in
the individual spectra will introduce no problems with the arithmetic mean composites,
as the composite spectra will be composed of the arithmetic mean spectra of both the
quasars and their host galaxies. The geometric mean composites, however, may be dis-
torted in unpredictable ways with the inclusion of host galaxy components. For example,
if the same host galaxy spectrum were added to every quasar spectrum in a sample, the
geometric mean of the sums would be larger than the sum of the host galaxy and the
geometric mean of the quasar spectra (Hoehn & Niven 1985). Caution should be taken
then when interpreting the spectral slopes of geometric mean composites in bins where
the host galaxy component is likely to be significant. We will highlight such cases in the
analysis of the composite spectra.
While constructing the composite spectra, individual spectra were scaled so that
the flux density of a quasar best matched that of the running composite spectrum in the
overlapping wavelength regions. Because the logarithmic luminosity density bin widths
are set to 0.25, the scale factor for an individual spectrum can have a maximum value
of 1.78. Because of the relatively small redshift bin widths, the overlapping wavelength
region will cover at least 93% of the wavelengths range of an individual spectrum.
The individual spectra can be weighted, e.g. by the inverse variance at each
pixel, in order to improve S/N of the composite. However, this approach may overly
weight the higher luminosity quasars in each bin, as they will tend to have spectra of
higher S/N than their lower luminosity counterparts. The effect may be negligible in our
analysis because all of the quasars in a given bin have approximately the same luminosity,
and the higher S/N is advantageous in some cases. We have generated both weighted
and unweighted composite spectra for each bin for both the geometric and arithmetic
composites.
In the unweighted spectrum case, arithmetic mean and geometric mean values of
the scaled flux densities were calculated at each rest wavelength pixel. The geometric
mean composite spectra were generated by constructing the arithmetic means of the
logarithms of the luminosity density spectra. Because the geometric mean of sequences
that contain negative values is not defined, pixels with negative flux density values were
masked.
19
2.3 Spectral Fitting
We have constructed four sets of composite spectra corresponding to two ways
of averaging spectra (geometric and arithmetic) and whether the averaging process is
weighted or unweighted. As proved by Vanden Berk et al. (2001), the geometric mean
spectra preserves the spectral slope. Therefore, in this work we analyze the 186 geometric
weighted mean composite spectra in the rest-frames with redshift ranging from 0.000 to
4.754 and logarithmic luminosity densities (log lλ, in erg s
−1 Å−1) ranging from 38.25 to
44.00. There are 37 composites that were created from less than ten individual spectra
(see Figure 2.2). These composites, while available for public use, are not included in
our analysis. In the following discussion, the 149 composites formed from at least ten
spectra (blue and green boxes in Figure 2.2) were used.
The underlying continuum of each spectrum is fit using a two-component power-
law (here after double power-law), the small Balmer bump, and the iron emission forest in
the UV and optical bands. After this continuum is subtracted from the composite spec-
trum, the emission lines are fit using single or multiple Gaussian profiles. We developed
a software package in IDL, named QSFIT, to perform the spectral fitting process. In
the subsections below, we describe the algorithms used in this package. The architecture
and technical details are described in the software manual (see Appendix B).
2.3.1 Continuum Subtraction
The major component of the underlying continuum in quasar is the power-law,
defined here as fλ = 10
βλαλ . For quasar spectra with z < 0.7, a two component power-
law is required (see Figure 3 of Vanden Berk et al. 2001) in the UV and optical bands.
The two power-laws have different indices and scaling factors and intersect at ≈ 5600 Å
in most cases. The redshifts of over 67% spectra in our sample are greater than 0.7
where only a UV power-law is needed.
The second continuum component is the small Balmer, or 3000 Å, bump (Grandi
1982; Oke et al. 1984) between 2000 Å and 4000 Å. A definitive conclusion on the
origin of this feature has not yet been reached. In general, this feature is believed to be
produced by a combination of a low ionization iron emission (Fe ii and Fe iii) forest,
the lower order Balmer lines, and Balmer continuum (Oke et al. 1984; Wills et al. 1985).
It has been shown that the shape of the Balmer continuum can be fitted by either a
small-optical-depth, high-temperature continuum or a T ∼ 10000 K, τ ∼ 1–2 continuum
(Wills et al. 1985). We follow the fitting model adopted in Vanden Berk et al. (2001)
for this continuum component. This feature has a continuous shape but a connection
point at λB = 3663 Å. The component with λ < λB represents an attenuated black body
spectrum and the λ ≤ λB is an exponential decay (e.g., Grandi 1982).

When λ ≥ λB, fλ is an exponential decay which simulates the lower order Balmer line
forest emission. The expression when λ ≤ λB is a modified black-body spectrum. We
fix the value of TB = 10
4 K and τB = 1, leaving the scale factor AB as the only free
parameter. A typical 3000 Å bump profile is presented in Figure 2.4.
The third contributor to the continuum is the low ionization iron emission forest,
which is far more complicated than the previous two components. Wills et al. (1985)
simulated the Fe ii emission using photoionization modeling of ∼ 3000 individual lines.
Although we attempted to fit the iron emission forest using individual lines by a generic
algorithm, it is very difficult to converge to a stable solution, i.e., there are many possible
solutions which can produce equally good spectral fits. Because it is almost impossible to
handle each individual iron emission profile, we decide to use iron templates, which are
widely employed in quasar spectral fitting (e.g., Trump et al. 2009; Wu et al. 2009; Shen
et al. 2010). We adopt the UV iron emission template from Vestergaard & Wilkes (2001)
ranging from 1075 − 3090 Å, and the optical iron emission template from Véron-Cetty
et al. (2004) that covers from 3535 − 7534 Å. We convolve each template with Gaussian
profiles and create a series of 36 iron emission spectra with velocity dispersions ranging
from 1, 250 − 10, 000 km s−1 spaced at 250 km s−1.
The iron emission forest is represented as
fλ,uv = AuvNuvfλ,uv (σuv) (2.2)
fλ,o = AoNofλ,o (σo) (2.3)
in which the subscripts “uv” and “o” represent “UV” and “optical” regions. The overall
normalization factors for the iron templates are Nuv = 10
16 and No = 1. The quantities
σuv and σo are velocity dispersions of UV and optical templates, respectively. By default,
the entire UV (optical) template has a universal scale factor Auv (Ao). However, either
template can be subdivided into a number of sections during the manual/automatic
fitting processes so that the user/program can individually set the scaling factors for
each section of the iron template. We do not change the velocity dispersion for each
section of the UV (or optical) template because in most cases, we can find acceptable
fits using the same value of the dispersion. Visual inspection of the fits revealed a few
cases where the iron complex was clearly redshifted or blueshifted. For these composites,
a small offset (∆z ∼ 0.001) was applied to the iron template in the fitting process.
We first estimate the power-law component by connecting two relatively “line-
free” windows tabulated in Table 2.1. Each of these regions is assigned two attributes:
a priority and a decremental factor. Wavelength windows with higher priority are pref-
erentially used because these regions are relatively less contaminated by emission lines.
When these high priority wavelength windows are not covered in the spectrum, we use
wavelength windows with lower priorities, which may reduce power-law estimation ac-
curacy. A fine-tuning of decremental factors in the next step can potentially helpful
to increase the accuracy. A “decremental factor” is used to “correct” the emission line
contamination in these “line-free” windows; a default value is 0.97 was chosen.
When estimating a power-law, we first select the wavelength windows covered by
a spectrum. If more than two windows are selected, the program generates a power-law
for each pair of windows and ranks each power-law fitting based on goodness-of-fits,
21
which is the reduced χ2 evaluated for all pixels in all “line-free” windows. This ranking
process excludes “line-free” windows which are so close in wavelength that the power-law
fluxes predicted at other “line-free” windows significantly deviate from observed fluxes.
This process selects a pair of “line-free” windows which produces the best power-law
continuum among all possible “line-free” window combinations.
After the optimal window pair is selected, the program adaptively adjusts the
decremental factors for each window until three conditions are satisfied: (1) mean flux
densities at central wavelengths of all emission lines are above the power-law component;
(2) mean flux densities at all line-free windows are above the power-law component; (3)
mean flux densities at all line-free windows are no more than 3σ above than the power-law
component. The mean flux is evaluated by averaging flux densities of ±2.5 Å centered
around the emission line central wavelengths. The optical power-law (λ > λp) is usually
much easier to fit than the UV counterpart. Connecting two “line-free” windows usually
gives a good power-law estimation.
For composites formed from relatively few spectra (e.g., N < 20), the composite
may exhibit absorption features in the line-free regions. We have not identified an
effective method to detect and avoid these troughs automatically, so we visually inspect
the power-law estimation results and customize the windows to estimate the power-law
for these spectra.
In the next phase, we perform a joint fitting process by considering all the three
components. This process can be performed either interactively or automatically using
QSFIT. Our method first automatically fits the spectra using the Levenberg-Marquardt
least-squares technique (More & Wright 1993) and then allows manually adjustment of
the parameters. The fitting parameters, their initial values, and their limits are tabulated
in Table 2.3. To evaluate the goodness-of-fit, we compare the original spectra and the
synthesized continua within a set of benchmark wavelengths (Table 2.2). Finally, the
continuum complex is subtracted from the original spectra, and the residuals are used for
emission line measurements. Figure 2.5 shows two examples of the underlying continuum
fitting results.
The uncertainties in this fit arise from the following sources:
1. Original observational random uncertainties that propagate to the composite spec-
tra. This effect is especially conspicuous for pixels with less than 15 contributing
quasars.
2. Redshift uncertainties caused by using different emission lines to calculate redshifts.
3. The iron templates. For example, the UV iron template is extracted from the
narrow line Seyfert galaxy 1 ZW i (Vestergaard & Wilkes 2001); it is unlikely that
this iron emission template represents the iron emission for all quasars.
4. The model for the 3000 Å bump, which is not well parameterized.
5. Our model to fit the spectra. Although a global power-law provides a reasonable
match to the general shape of the quasar spectrum in the UV band,the situation
in reality is undoubtedly more complicated, particularly at the intersection of the
UV and optical power-law components. In addition, not all the quasar UV spectra
22
can be well fit by a single power-law. As we will see below we must occasionally
use a local power-law when fitting an emission line.
2.3.2 Emission Lines
We fit the each emission line by a series of Gaussian profiles. The number of
profiles used to fit an emission line is empirical, and is dependent on the goodness-of-fit.
If an emission line is relatively separated or weakly blended with other lines, we fit it
independently; otherwise, we fit the blended lines simultaneously. If the global continuum
is obviously below or above the local continuum level around a certain emission line or
an emission line group, we measure the line flux after subtracting the total flux around
this emission line (group) with a local power-law continuum. We then apply a low pass
band filter to smooth the spectrum around the line fitting region. We recognize the
existence of an emission line if the peak signal strength around the emission line rest-
frame wavelength is stronger than three times of the amplitude of the spectral noise at
the peak signal pixel.
We fit an emission line using a single or multiple Gaussian profiles using the
Levenberg-Marquardt least-squares fit. Generally, a broad emission line is fit using a
broad component at the base and a narrow component for the core. However, some
lines require three Gaussian profiles, e.g., Hβ. Most narrow lines are well fit by a single
Gaussian profile. If a weak line is blended with a strong line, the fitting procedure
may neglect the weak line and treat is as noise, i.e., the weak line is not fit essentially.
To preserve this weak line, we must reduce the degree of freedom by sample a piece
of spectrum around the weak line peak and fitting these points with a single Gaussian
to estimate of the weak line dispersion. We then fix the dispersion a constraint when
performing joint fitting with the strong line. If a strong broad emission line is blended
with multiple weak narrow emission lines, we mask these weak narrow emission lines and
focus on fitting the strong lines first. We then fit the weak narrow lines after subtracting
the broad line contribution. For example, the Hα line is blended with two [N ii] lines on
either side close to its peak, and two [S ii] lines beyond its red wing. In this situation, we
first mask [N ii] and [S ii] lines and fit Hα. Then, we subtract Hα and fit the weak lines
we masked. In some cases, narrow absorption features can appear in a broad emission
line; when this occurs, we manually mask the absorption line region.
Table 2.4 lists all the emission lines we fit. The last column gives the default type
of continuum subtracted. We present some emission line fitting examples Figure 2.6.
2.3.3 Error Analyses
The uncertainties of both continuum and emission line fitting parameters are es-
timated by artificially adding noise to the model spectra obtained in spectral fitting
process. The noise amplitude for each pixel in the simulations follows a normal distri-
bution, with the width of the normal distribution at each pixel equal the flux density
uncertainty at that pixel. For each model spectrum, we artificially produce 100 noisy
spectra and fit each one automatically in the same manner we fit the original composite.
23
The statistical uncertainty of each spectral parameter is then measured from its distri-
bution (usually a reasonable facsimiled Gaussian). This method counts only random
uncertainties, which are dependent on the composite S/N .
2.3.4 Sensitivity of Fitting Results to Initial Guess Values
We use the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LMA) (Levenberg 1944; Marquardt
1963; Gill & Murray 1978) in both of underlying continuum and emission line fitting
processes. The LMA interpolates between the Gauss-Newton algorithm (Bj orck 1996)
and the method of gradient descent (Avriel 2003). The LMA is more robust than GNA,
which means that in many cases it finds a solution even if the initial guess is far off the
final minimum. This algorithm has been programmed in many programming languages
and is part of the Curve Fitting and Function Minimization package of the Markwardt
IDL Library 2. The LMA method has been used in quasar spectral fitting in Shen et al.
(2008a). In our continuum fitting process, we found that the fitting results based on
this algorithm changes if we use a different set of initial guess values. To investigate
the initial guess impact on the final fitting results, we vary the initial guess parameters
and explore how the final results vary correspondingly. We perform this experiments
to spectra at different redshifts, and we found that the variation of continuum fitting
results corresponding to initial value changes is negligible or not significant. The results
of emission line fitting results are even more stable since the fitting process uses analytical
expressions (multiple Gaussian profiles) as templates. A representative case is presented
in this section using a quasar spectrum at z = 1.089 and log lλ = 42.00. This spectrum
covers a wavelength range between 1656 Åand 4420 Åin its rest-frame, which includes
both of UV and optical iron templates and the small blue bump feature. There are
five parameters that are the most important in fitting the underlying continuum shape
(see Table 2.3), α1, β1, AB, AFe,u and AFe,o. The initial values of these parameters are
tabulated in Table 2.5. In each experiment, I change the initial guess of one of the five
parameters and obtain the fitting results of all five parameters. The fitting outcomes are
presented in Figures 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 2.10 and, 2.11.
From these plots, we can see that although changes of initial values cause changes
of fitting results, in most of cases,the change is small and negligible. For example, a
change of α1 by −0.1 only leads to a change of its fitting results by about 0.01. In
my experiments, the iron template scale factors influence the fitting results the most
(Figures 2.10 and 2.11), but in these cases, at least two parameters (e.g., AFe,u, AFe,o
and AB) change in the opposite way so that the overall spectral shape does not exhibit
significant change.
The experiments above indicate that it is in general safe to use the initial pa-
rameters in Table 2.3 to perform continuum spectral fitting. In contrast to LMA, the
evolutionary algorithm provides a most robust and stable method to solve the multi-
variable optimization problem. With proper setups, it can find the global minimum and
the fitting results are not sensitive to initial parameter values. An attempt to fit quasar
continuum spectrum using this method is presented in Appendix A.

2.4 Spectral Properties
2.4.1 Continuum Properties
In the spectral fitting process, the underlying continuum is comprised of the UV
and optical power-law continua, the small blue bump, and low ionization iron emissions.
In this section, we focus on the UV power-law spectral index as this is the dominant
component of the quasar continuum shape at UV band. In addition, the optical PL is
not covered in SDSS spectra with z > 0.3.
In the upper panel of Figure 2.12, we plot the UV power-law spectral index αλ
as a function of luminosity for different redshifts. It is clear that most spectral indices
lie between −1.9 and −1.3 with a median around αλ ≈ −1.6; these values correspond
to αν(= −2 − αλ) between −0.1 and −0.7 with a median of −0.4. This is in agreement
with previous work (e.g., Richstone & Schmidt 1980; Boroson & Green 1992; Vanden
Berk et al. 2001; Dietrich et al. 2002; Telfer et al. 2002). For quasars with luminosity
39 . log lλ . 42 and 0.000 . z . 1.512, more luminous quasars tend to have smaller
αλ (bluer). Host galaxy contributions have been subtracted for low redshift (z < 0.7)
composite quasar spectra. This trend most likely reflects intrinsic reddening from quasars
and/or an reddening due to intervening dust (Hopkins et al. 2004; Richards 2006,
private communication) Above log lλ ∼ 42, the slopes do not show strong dependence
on luminosity. The highest redshift quasars in our sample (4.248 6 z 6 4.754) do
not appear to follow the above trend, but the result must be given low weight because
composite spectra at these redshifts are generated by relatively small number of real
quasar spectra (< 100; see Figure 2.2) and individual differences may be subject to
small number variations.
The upper panel of Figure 2.12 also suggests a redshift dependence of αλ. In the
bottom panel of Figure 2.12, we plot αλ as a function of redshift. We divide the entire
redshift range into a four regions corresponding to four sources of redshift measurements.
The power-law indices of luminous and high redshift quasars with 42 . log lλ . 44 and
1.6 . z . 3.8 do not exhibit significant change over redshift. The rise at z ∼ 1.512
with respect to z ∼ 1.291 is because the line-free windows used to estimate the continua
of these two spectra are different. As redshift increases, the long wavelength cut-off
of the rest-frame spectra moves farther away from 4200 Å, which is a key benchmark
wavelength for power-law estimation. Between 2200 Å and 4200 Å is a complex which
consists of low ionization iron emission forest and the small blue bump whose flux level is
very unpredictable. Although we can use the 1360 Å and 2200 Å windows as benchmarks
to estimate the power-law, the uncertainty in the power-law inevitably becomes larger
because these two benchmarks have relatively little wavelength separation. Using these
two windows, the power-law is estimated based on only 1/3 of the entire wavelength
range for a z = 1.512 spectrum. Therefore, this dip may not reflect any true trends of
spectral indices (Richards 2007, private communication). At redshifts lower than this
local minimum, the spectral index tends to decrease with redshift. Spectral indices of less
luminous quasars with 40 . log lλ . 41 change faster with redshift than more luminous
quasars with 41 . log lλ . 43. At low luminosity (log lλ . 40), the number of quasar
spectra used to generate the composite is small.

2.4.2 Properties of Emission Lines
2.4.2.1 Baldwin Effect (BEff)
Baldwin (1977) discovered that the rest equivalent width (EW) of C iv is anti-
correlated with quasar luminosity density at 1450 Å, lλ(1450 Å). Later work found that
the BEff exists for other strong UV/optical metal emission lines such as Mgii λ2798 and
C iii] λ1908 (e.g., Kinney et al. 1990; Dietrich et al. 2002).
The BEff was initially thought to have the potential to predict quasar luminosity
using only EW measurements. This idea was shown to be infeasible due to large scatter
of this relationship (e.g., Baldwin et al. 1989; Kinney et al. 1990; Osmer & Shields 1999;
Wu et al. 2009), especially in small samples or ones that do not cover a sufficiently large
range in luminosity. The scatter is contributed by multiple sources, including the intrinsic
BEff (e.g., Pogge & Peterson 1992), variability (Wu et al. 2009 estimated that ∼ 60%
of the C iv λ1549 BEff can be attributed to variability), population effects (Baldwin
1977 noted that flat-radio-spectrum quasars showed the tightest C iv λ1549 BEff) and
possibly evolutionary effects. Investigation to the evolutionary effects has been difficult
for most flux-limited samples because it requires wide ranges of coverage in both redshift
and luminosity. Our composite spectrum set, with its coverage of the redshift-luminosity
panel (Figure 2.2) is ideal for the study of the behavior of BEff with redshift.
In Figure 2.13, we present seven composite spectra at the same redshift bin (z =
2.020), but spanning more than an order of magnitude in luminosity. The spectra are
normalized to unity at 2000 Å, and color-coded according to their luminosity. While
the spectral shapes are similar, the strengths of several emission lines, such as Lyα,
C iv λ1549, C iii λ1908, and Mg ii λ2798, exhibit evident BEff, i.e., more luminous
quasars tend to have relatively weaker emission lines.
In Figure 2.14, we plot the behavior of the EW of eight strong emission lines with
log lλ. The BEff exists for emission lines such as Lyα, Siiv λ1396, Civ λ1549, Heii λ1640,
and Ciii] λ1908. This result is consistent with previous works based on Bright Quasar
Survey sample (Baskin & Laor 2004), SDSS sample (Richards et al. 2002a), 2dF+6dF
sample (Croom et al. 2002) and samples consisting of type 1 AGNs (e.g., Wilkes et al.
1999; Dietrich et al. 2002). In Figure 2.15, we plot the distribution of uncertainties of
log EW for all the data points in each panel of Figure 2.14. The uncertainties of log EW
for most emission lines are less than 0.1. Larger uncertainties occur for composite spectra
generated with small number (< 100) of SDSS spectra .
We fit the BEff relationships of different emission lines at a given redshift as
log (EW/EW0) = k log (lλ/l
0
λ
) + b, in which EW0 = 10 Å, and l
0
λ
= 1042 erg s−1. The
slopes and intercepts of three prominent emission lines (C iv λ1549, Mg ii λ2798 and
Si iv λ1396) are tabulated in Table 2.6. The mean slope of the C iv λ1549, Mg ii λ2798
and Si iv λ1396 BEff is −0.276, −0.207 and −0.129, respectively. The uncertainty of
BEff slope values depends on the number of data points in the linear fitting and should
be δk . 0.1. The relatively large slope uncertainties arise because they are obtained by
fitting only a few data points (typically < 10). As a result, the slope can be sensitive
to the EW value of a single or a few data points, which are affected by systematic
errors transited from “line-free” window selection in the power-law estimation. The
traditional ordinary least square fitting method is based on the Gaussian distributional
26
data points and is not suitable for small number of data points and may underestimate
the uncertainties. Therefore, we perform a bias correction using the Jackknife statistics
(Shao & Tu 1995).
For data points at a given redshift, we first perform a linear fit to all n data
points and obtain the slope k̂ and intercept b̂ (note that the “intercept” is defined as
l0
λ
= 1042 erg s−1). Then, we remove the i-th data point and fit the remaining ones to
obtain a slope ki. We repeat the second step for n times by looping i over each pair of
(log lλ, log EW). We can then estimate the Jackknife bias as kb = (n− 1)(k̄ − k̂), which
may be used as a correction term to produce re-estimate of k̂: kJK = k̂−kb = nk̂−(n−1)k̄,
in which k̄ = 1n
∑
ki. The variance can be expressed as δkJK =
√
n−1
n
∑
(ki − k̂)2. In
Table 2.6, we tabulate the slopes and intercepts of BEff relationships for C iv λ1549,
Mg ii λ2798, and Si iv λ1396 at each available redshift using the Jackknife method. In
Figure 2.16, we plot the BEff slope as a function of redshift for the three emission lines
based on the fitting results in Table 2.6. The typical Jackknife biases are . 0.01 for both
slopes and intercepts although it can be up to ∼ 0.1.
The BEff slopes for Siiv λ1396 are consistent with that in Dietrich et al. (2002,
here after D02), but our slopes for C iv λ1549 and Mg ii λ2798 are ∼ 0.15 and ∼ 0.1
lower, respectively than those in D02. This discrepancy could be caused by the non-
linear nature of the BEff, because the D02 sample contains not only quasars but also
Seyfert 1 galaxies. In D02 log lλ(1450 Å) ranges from 38.55 to 44.55 (Figure 7 of Dietrich
et al. 2002), which covers 6 orders of magnitude. It has been found that the BEff slope
becomes shallower for low luminosity AGNs; for example, D02 perform linear fits to
objects with log lλ & 40.55 for all emission lines, and found that the slopes are steeper
than fitting all objects including lower luminosity. The lowest luminosities of our sample
for these emission lines are 0–1.45 dex higher than 40.55. For C iv λ1549, the data points
start to depart from linearity below log lλ = 40.55 so we obtained the same slope as D02.
As a result, the luminosity range used to measure the BEff may have a considerable
influence on the BEff slope and increase the scatter of this relationship.
The slopes of the BEff for all lines do not exhibit significant change over redshift.
In Figure 2.16, the BEff slopes k for all of these three emission lines are consistent of
being constant over redshift within the error bars. The error bars estimated by Jackknife
method indicate that the variations are caused by systematic measurement uncertainties
in spectral fitting process. The relatively large uncertainties are caused by performing
linear fits with only a small number of data points. For example, each slope of the
Mg ii λ2798 BEff curve in Figure 2.16 is obtained by fitting only 7–9 data points; some
slope values on the C iv λ1549 and Si iv λ1396 BEff curve are obtained by fitting 4–5
data points.
The scale factors (b, the intercept) of the BEff exhibit changes with redshift
(Figure 2.14), namely, the BEff of quasars at higher redshift tend to have larger scale
factors (larger EW at a given luminosity). For C iv λ1549 the increment is ∼ 0.17 dex
from z = 1.512 to z = 3.786; for Mg ii λ2798 the increment is ∼ 0.25 dex from z = 0.318
to z = 2.020; for Si iv λ1396, however, the increment is only ∼ 0.03 dex from z = 1.754
to z = 4.248. The changes of BEff scale factors over redshift contribute to scatter of the
overall BEff correlation, and this contribution may be significant for a sample consisting
27
of objects covering a large range of redshift. The redshift dependence of BEff is an
important factor that makes BEff impossible to be used for luminosity estimation.
Among the above three emission lines, the Mg ii λ2798 BEff has the largest change
of scale factor with redshift. Figure 2.20 shows the Mg ii λ2798 EW as a function of
redshift for a given luminosity. Quasars with 41 . log lλ . 42 exhibit a noticeable change
from z ∼ 1.5 to z ∼ 2.5. The decrease of EW at z = 1.512 is caused by using different
benchmark windows from z = 1.291 (see Figure 2.12 and explanations in Section 2.4.1).
The EW of quasars with 42 . log lλ . 44 do not exhibit a similar amount of change
over redshfit. Composites at the lowest and highest redshifts in Figure 2.20 have large
uncertainties because they are generated from small number of quasar spectra.
In contrast to our results, D02 reported no detection of any significant evolution-
ary effect of EW for Mgii and other emission lines. We suspect that this disagreement
arises because their luminosity range for Mg ii 43.0 ≤ log Lλ(1450Å) ≤ 44.0, corresponds
to the high luminosity range of our composites. As seen from Figure 2.20, the EW change
in that luminosity range is not as significant as lower luminosity ones.
In our emission line fitting process, we attempt the difficult separation of Lyα
and Nv. We do not find Nv λ1239 exhibits a significant BEff. The mean slope of a
linear fit to log EW and log lλ for Nv is −0.027±0.025; this weak dependence of Nv EW
with luminosity is in agreement with Osmer et al. (1994) and D02. However, similar to
emission lines with BEff, we do see an increase of the average EW with redshift, which
is about 0.3 dex from z = 2.020 to z = 4.248.
The Hβ EW in our sample also exhibits only a weak dependence on luminosity;
an average BEff slope is −0.029± 0.009 (see Table 2.7). This measurement is consistent
with results by Boroson & Green (1992) and Dietrich et al. (2002). However, using a
sample of 22,000 quasars from 2dF+6dF, Croom et al. (2002) finds an inverse BEff for
Hβ and Hγ in which BEff slope k = 0.2. Greene & Ho (2005) found this slope is k = 0.1
using 229 z ≤ 0.35 AGNs (so that Hα is in the bandpass) selected from SDSS DR3
(Abazajian et al. 2005). Croom et al. (2002) postulates that this result is caused by a
luminosity change in the ratio of disk to non-disk continuum components. The weak
or inverse BEff of Hβ probably reflects that individual species have different responses
to changes of ionizing flux. High ionization ions are more sensitive to the changes of
luminosity than low ionization ions.
It has been reported that the BEff slope is anti-correlated with ionization poten-
tial of the ion producing an emission line (Espey & Andreadis 1999; Dietrich et al. 2002).
The ionization potentials used in Vanden Berk et al. (2001) and Dietrich et al. (2002)
have different definitions. The former uses the ionization potential to ionize a particular
ion U1, e.g., from Mgii→Mgiii, while the latter uses the ionization potential U0 to create
this ion, e.g., from Mgi to Mgii. To be consistent, we adopt the convention in Vanden
Berk et al. (2001). In Figure 2.7, we plot the BEff slopes of prominent emission lines as a
function of their ionization potential U1. Comparing these results with Figure 9 of D02,
the values of slopes are different for several lines such as C iv λ1549, and Mg ii λ2798,
which could be due to difference of luminosity range (see argument above), but the gen-
eral trend remains, i.e., emission lines produced by ions with higher potentials tend to
have steep BEff slopes. This trend may indicate a stratified structure of the broad line
region (BLR). Under the locally optically emitting clouds (LOC) model (Baldwin et al.
28
1995), the each emission line is optimally produced at a certain radius with a narrow
range of density. Higher ionization lines are produced closer to the central continuum
source than lower ionization lines, and are more sensitive to luminosity changes than
lower ionization lines, resulting in a steeper BEff slope. The Nv line is an exception,
probably because of its abnormal abundance patten (Korista et al. 1998, , here after K98).
K98 found in their calculations that while the EW of Lyα, C iv λ1549 and Ovi λ1032
exhibit almost no dependence on metallicity, the EW of Nv λ1239 shows a strong depen-
dence on gas metallicity (Figure 1 of K98). As a secondary element, nitrogen’s rapidly
increasing abundance with increasing metallicity (N/H∝ Z2) compensates for the losses
in its EW emitted by gas illuminated by softer continua in higher-luminosity quasars. In
addition, there is a growing evidence that the gas metallicity increases with increasing
luminosity. Earlier work based on the Nv/He ii and Nv/C iv line ratios (Hamann &
Ferland 1992, 1993; Ferland et al. 1996) indicates that metallicities are typically solar or
higher and nitrogen is selectively enhanced. There is also a significant trend in these line
ratios, suggesting higher metallicities in more luminous quasars (e.g., Osmer et al. 1994;
Korista et al. 1998). Figure 7 in Hamann & Ferland (1999) clearly shows that emission
line ratio of Nv/He ii increases with luminosity. The combination of the facts that
metallicity increases with luminosity and the strong dependence of nitrogen abundance
on metallicity provide a plausible explanation that Nv λ1239 does not exhibit a BEff.
In early work by Cristiani & Vio (1990) and Francis & Koratkar (1995), the
Siiv+Oiv] blend shows little or no evidence of BEff. In our fitting process, we attempt
to separate the blend and found an evident BEff for Si iv λ1396 (Figure 2.14).
2.4.2.2 Systematic Emission Line Shift
The expression “emission line shift” refers to the emission line center offset from
the laboratory wavelength after transforming a spectrum from the observer’s frame to
the quasar’s rest frame (Gaskell 1982). Because quasar redshifts are measured by fitting
reference emission/absorption lines, it is usually difficult to define the absolute emission
line shift for quasar spectra which do not cover proper reference lines. Redshift estimates
based on the detection of photospheric absorption from stars in the spatially averaged
spectrum of the quasar host galaxy might be expected to provide a close to “ideal”
systematic redshift. The most reliable reference used to measure quasar redshifts are
perhaps the Ca ii λλ3934.8, 3969.6 doublet. However, given the nature of the SDSS
spectra, coupled with the large luminosity of quasars at rest-frame compared to their
host galaxies, it is impossible to detect the Ca ii H&K feature for the majority of SDSS
quasars. As a result, we must use other emission lines as surrogates to Ca ii H&K.
Thus, for most quasars we measure the relative emission line shift which is the offset
of an emission line centroid after shifting the spectrum to the rest-frame of a reference
emission line.
The narrow forbidden emission lines of [O iii] λλ4960, 5008 are prominent in many
low redshift (z < 0.8) SDSS quasar spectra and are usually taken as a good reference
line to redshift measurements (e.g., Hewett & Wild 2010). In Figure 2.18, we present
distributions of relative emission line shifts for individual or composites. The emission
line centroids are measured using the eigenspectrum technique described in Section 2.2.
29
The positions of distribution peaks thus represent the average line shift with respect to a
given reference line. In the upper left panel of Figure 2.18, the distribution peak is well
consistent with 0 km s−1 with a few tens of km s−1 redshift indicating that the redshift
measured based on Hβ emission line is close to the redshift of the quasar itself (from
[O iii]). The upper right panel demonstrates that the Mg ii λ2798 line has a systematic
offset of . −100 km s−1 in the rest-frame of [O iii]. The distribution at the lower
left indicates that this offset becomes larger (. 200 km s−1) if the redshift is measured
according to Hβ. The panel on the lower right indicates that the C iv λ1549 line is
systematically shifted towards blue by ∼ 400 km s−1 in the rest-frame of Mg ii λ2798.
Combining information from these distributions, it is clear that the Mg ii λ2798 and
C iv λ1549 are systematically blueshifted with respect to the quasar rest-frame of by
∼ 150 km s−1 and ∼ 800 km s−1, respectively. The emission line shift values measured
in spectra whose redshifts are determined by different emission lines can be different, so
emission line shift correlations must be studied using a set of spectra whose redshifts are
measured using the same reference line.
Line-shifts of different ions exhibit a general anti-correlation with ionization po-
tentials of the ions contributing to emission lines (e.g., Tytler & Fan 1992; Vanden Berk
et al. 2001; Richards et al. 2002a). Most emission lines are blue shifted with respect
to the quasar host galaxy (e.g., see Table 4 in Vanden Berk et al. 2001), suggesting
that emission line regions are moving towards the observer along the line-of-sight. This
anti-correlation is also seen in our quasar sample. In Figure 2.19, we plot the mean
emission line shifts which are averaged over a redshift range vs. ionization potentials for
a number of emission lines. The four panels correspond to four ways to measure object
redshifts. The mean value of emission line shift may vary in different panels because
the redshifts are measured using different reference lines. Most of emission line shifts in
Panel (c) are positive, indicating that the C iv line is a strongly blue shifted relative to
the quasar redshift.
The emission line shifts of permitted and semi-forbidden lines are in general an
order of magnitude larger than forbidden lines. This result is consistent with Figure 9
of Vanden Berk et al. (2001). Most forbidden lines are narrow lines and are produced in
the NLR, which is distant from the central continuum source. The ionization radiation
has much weaker influence to these line emitters than in the broad line region which is
much closer to the central engine.
Our result is consistent with that by D02 in that the C iv λ1549 is systematically
blueshifted by 800 km s−1 on average with respect to the Mg ii λ2798. In Panel (b) of
Figure 2.19, the average separation between C iv λ1549 and Mg ii λ2798 is ∼ 600 km s−1.
In Figure 2.21, we plot the emission line redshift as a function of luminosity, which
shows that this shift increases with luminosity from ∼ 100 km s−1 for low luminosity
(log lλ ∼ 41.5) to ∼ 800 km s−1 for high luminosity objects (log lλ ∼ 43.0).
The exact origin of line shift is not clear, but Richards et al. (2002a) suggested
that the apparent blueshift is due to a lack of flux in the red wing of the Civ emission line
profile. As a result, more blueshifted emission lines have stronger BEff. This relation
does not apply for Nv λ1239, which exhibits a strong emission line shift (Panel 3 of
Figure 2.19) but it does not exhibit strong BEff. Another example is Si iv λ1396, which
displays a strong BEff but has a small line shift with respect to Mg ii λ2798.
30
Some emission line shifts exhibit evident dependence with luminosity and/or red-
shift. Figure 2.21 presents the mean line shift over given redshift ranges for some emission
lines as a function of luminosity. In Panel (a) of Figure 2.21, the H i λ5877 tends to have
a smaller red emission line shift with respect to Hβ. In Panel (b) of Figure 2.21, C iv
emission line shift decreases with increasing luminosity. This result is consistent with
Figure 9 in Hewett & Wild (2010). Combining this relation with the trend that more lu-
minous quasars have smaller C iv EW, this fact indicates that these two phenomena are
likely to be connected, as both of the EW and line shifts are correlated by the spectral
energy distribution (SED). The strong anti-correlation between EW(C iv) and αox
3 is
presented in Figure 4 of Wu et al. (2009), indicating that the αox is a fundamental driver
of the change of EW(C iv). On the other hand, the C iv blueshift is also correlated with
αox (see Figure 9 of Richards et al. 2011), suggesting that objects with more negative
values of αox (softer SED) have more strongly blueshifted C iv. A more straightforward
view of the relationship between C iv EW and its blueshift can be seen in Figure 10 of
Richards et al. (2011). The strong correlation between these two quantities suggests that
these two phenomena are not independent and both of them are possibly controlled by
αox, which approximately characterizes the SED between UV and X-ray bands. If this is
true, both the C iv BEff and the luminosity dependence of line shift are both secondary
effects, considering the UV luminosity is strongly correlated with αox (e.g., Vignali et al.
2003; Strateva et al. 2005; Steffen et al. 2006; Just et al. 2007). Richards et al. (2011)
considers these two phenomena within the context of an accretion disk wind model in
which the wind filters the continuum seen by the disk component. A detailed discussion
of this model is beyond the scope of this work, but the C iv EW and blueshifts are cap-
turing an important trade-off between “disk” and “wind” components to UV emission
lines that ultimately sensitive to the shape of the ionizing continuum.
In Panel (c) of Figure 2.21, the strong increase of positive emission line shift of
C iii] λ1908 and Mg ii λ2798 with luminosity is a result of strong blue shift of C iv,
because these mean line shifts are with respect to C iv, considering that Mg ii does not
exhibit a strong systematic line shift with respect to Hβ (upper left panel of Figure 2.19)
and that C iii] λ1908 does not exhibit a strong systematic line shift with Mg ii (upper
right panel of Figure 2.19).
In Figure 2.22, we see a decrease of line-shift of Hei λ5877 with redshift, but we
do not see similar trends for other emission lines.
2.4.2.3 Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of Emission Lines
We also found changes of FWHMs for several emission lines as functions of red-
shift and luminosity. Figure 2.23 presents the plots of FWHM against luminosity for
Mg ii λ2798 and C iv λ1549 at different redshifts. For Mg ii and C iv, we see a trend of
increasing line width with luminosity. The average slope of this correlation is 0.084±0.022

2007).

correlation with luminosity.
In Figure 2.23, we qualitatively see a trend of the dependence of FWHM-luminosity
relation on redshift. In Figure 2.24 we plot the FWHM against redshift, and find that the
FWHM exhibits a mild evolutionary trend with redshift. For a given luminosity, higher
redshift quasars tend to have smaller FWHM. This trend is seen in all luminosity ranges
of C iv, but only low luminosity quasars for Mg ii. For C iv, the change of FWHM can
be up to 2000 km s−1 from z = 1.754 to z = 4.248. The change of Mg ii FWHM is only
≈ 400 km s−1from z = 0.905 to z = 1.512.
2.5 Discussion
The most intriguing conclusion we draw using this composite spectrum set is
that the BEff evolves with redshift. This evolutionary trend was not seen in previous
published work because the SDSS quasar catalog provides an dataset with unprecedented
combination of wide ranges of redshift, luminosity and number of quasars. The origin of
the BEff has long been a subject of investigation and a number of possible explanations
have been proposed. For example, one promising explanation is that the UV/optical BEff
is due to the softening of the SED at high luminosity, which lowers the ion populations
having higher ionization potentials (e.g., Netzer et al. 1992; Zheng & Malkan 1993; Green
1996, 1998; Korista et al. 1998; Gibson et al. 2008; Wu et al. 2009). Other proposed BEff
divers include the Eddington ratio (e.g., Baskin & Laor 2004; Bachev et al. 2004; Warner
et al. 2004; Zhou & Wang 2005), and black hole mass (e.g., Netzer et al. 1992; Wandel
et al. 1999; Shields 2007).
The quasar SEDs, Eddington ratios and black hole masses are all found to be
correlated. For example, Shemmer et al. (2008) found a mild correlation (Spearman rank
coefficient r = −0.33, confident level p < 1.3×10−3) between αox and Lbol/LEdd using 81
sources from Steffen et al. (2006) sample with available FWHM(Hβ) measurements (z .
0.75; Figure 6 in their paper); Grupe et al. (2010) claims a strong correlation (Spearman
rank coefficient r = 0.55) between αox and Lbol/LEdd (Figure 13 of their paper) using
∼ 100 soft X-ray select AGNs; a similar correlation is also found in 150 X-ray selected
Type 1 AGNs in Lusso et al. (2010). The strong positive correlation between AGN black
hole mass and luminosity has been established and confirmed by reverberation mapping
results (e.g., Peterson et al. 2004) and AGN UV luminosity is found to be strongly
correlated to αox (e.g., Vignali et al. 2003; Strateva et al. 2005; Steffen et al. 2006; Just
et al. 2007). Combining all of these findings, BEff is transitively dependent on all of
these fundamental parameters used to characterize quasars. Therefore, the evolution of
BEff may be related to any of these parameters which exhibits evolution over redshift.
Particularly, the black hole growth over redshift may affect the accretion rate which
leads to a change of the SED shape. This can further cause a change of the ionization
structure of the BLR and eventually result in a change of line emission, which leads to
a systematic change of EW over redshift of a given luminosity.
The past decade has been great progress in measuring the black hole masses in
both nearby normal galaxies and AGNs (e.g., Kaspi et al. 2000; Peterson et al. 2004).
There has been growing number of observational evidence and constraints on the AGN
32
black hole growth across the cosmic time (e.g., Yu & Tremaine 2002; Cao 2010; Kelly
et al. 2010), although whether the black hole growth is down or up sizing is still in
debate. The black hole growth changes the accretion states which is also evolving (Yu
et al. 2005). A possible scenario is that as the black hole mass grows up, the accretion
becomes relatively inefficient, which lowers the accretion disk temperature. This makes
the incident flux from the background continuum source softer which decreases the yield
of the C3+ ion (see Wu et al. 2009 for a positive correlation between EW(C iv) and αox).
A further investigation of this problem may require a detailed model of quasar activity
combined with observational constraints of black hole growth (e.g., Small & Blandford
1992; Marconi et al. 2004), which is beyond the scope of this work.
2.6 Conclusion
We have compiled a set of 186 composite quasar spectra from SDSS DR3 quasar
catalog using the spectral binning, averaging and weighting techniques in Vanden Berk
et al. (2001). The advantage of the composite spectra is that this technique averages
the differences in individual spectra so as to highlight the common spectral properties.
In addition, the composite spectrum has a significantly higher S/N than an individual
SDSS spectrum so that even weak spectral features can be detected. This set of com-
posite spectra allows one to investigate spectral properties of quasars as a function of
luminosity and redshift. We developed a software package QSFIT to fit both the under-
lying continua and emission lines of all the composite spectra. Studying the continuum
and emission line properties reveals a number of trends.
1. The UV spectral indices of all quasars have a mean value of αλ ≈ −1.6 (or equiv-
alently, αν = −0.4). Low luminosity quasars at small redshifts tend to be redder
than high luminosity quasars at higher redshift. This trend applies to quasars with
log lλ . 42 and z . 2.
2. The Baldwin Effect exists not only for C iv λ1549 but also for other broad emission
lines such as Lyα Si iv λ1396, He ii λ1640, and Mg ii λ2798, but this effect is not
seen for Nv λ1239 and Hβ. While the slopes of the individual line BEffs do
not exhibit significant dependence over redshift, the scale factor of BEff exhibits
significant change with redshift. Typical changes are ∼ 0.2 dex for C iv λ1549 from
z = 1.5 to z = 3.8, and ∼ 0.25 dex for Mg ii λ2798 from z = 0.3 to z = 2.0. The
scale factor change for Si iv λ1396 is only ∼ 0.03 dex from z = 1.7 to z = 4.3. The
change of scale factor is an important contributor to the dispersion in the BEff for
a sample of quasars covering a wide range of redshifts.
3. We confirmed that in general the mean emission line shift decreases with the BEff
slope and ionization potential, i.e., emission lines produced by highly ionized atoms
are more blue-shifted, suggesting that the BLR region has a stratified structure.
The emission line shift of He i λ5877 with respect to Hβ decreases with luminosity;
the emission line shifts of C iv λ1549 with respect to Mg ii λ2798 becomes more
negative with increasing luminosity reaching ∼ 800 km s−1; in contrast, Al iii λ1857
and C iii] λ1908 emission lines exhibit a positive velocity shift with respect to
Mg ii λ2798, and the amount of line shift increases with luminosity.
33
4. The Mg ii λ2798 and C iv λ1549 emission lines tend to be broader for high luminos-
ity quasars; The average slope is α = 0.084± 0.022 for C iv and α = 0.051± 0.008
for Mg ii(FWHM ∝ lλα). The amplitudes of this correlation also exhibit changes
with redshift. At a given luminosity, the FWHMs of C iv λ1549 or Mg ii λ2798
tend to be lower at higher redshift.
5. The BEff, and the emission line shift redshift dependences are likely to be con-
nected. The strong BEff and blueshift of C iv λ1549 with respect to Mg ii suggest
that the background continuum may be shielded by the outflow from the accretion
disk, which supports the accretion disk wind model proposed by Richards et al.
(2002a). However, it remains unclear why some emission lines exhibit strong BEff
but small amount of emission line shift, e.g., Mg ii λ2798 and Si iv λ1396.
The most intriguing conclusion we draw using this composite spectrum set is that the
BEff evolves with redshift. This evolutionary trend was not seen in previous published
work because the SDSS quasar catalog provides an dataset with unprecedented combi-
nation of wide ranges of redshift, luminosity and number of quasars. The origin of the
BEff has long been a subject of investigation and a number of possible explanations have
been proposed. For example, one promising explanation is that the UV/optical BEff is
due to the softening of the SED at high luminosity, which lowers the ion populations
having higher ionization potentials (e.g., Netzer et al. 1992; Zheng & Malkan 1993; Green
1996, 1998; Korista et al. 1998; Gibson et al. 2008; Wu et al. 2009). Other proposed BEff
divers include the Eddington ratio (e.g., Baskin & Laor 2004; Bachev et al. 2004; Warner
et al. 2004; Zhou & Wang 2005), and black hole mass (e.g., Netzer et al. 1992; Wandel
et al. 1999; Shields 2007).
The quasar SEDs, Eddington ratios and black hole masses are all found to be
correlated. For example, Shemmer et al. (2008) found a mild correlation (Spearman rank
coefficient r = −0.33, confident level p < 1.3×10−3) between αox and Lbol/LEdd using 81
sources from Steffen et al. (2006) sample with available FWHM(Hβ) measurements (z .
0.75; Figure 6 in their paper); Grupe et al. (2010) claims a strong correlation (Spearman
rank coefficient r = 0.55) between αox and Lbol/LEdd (Figure 13 of their paper) using
∼ 100 soft X-ray select AGNs; a similar correlation is also found in 150 X-ray selected
Type 1 AGNs in Lusso et al. (2010). The strong positive correlation between AGN black
hole mass and luminosity has been established and confirmed by reverberation mapping
results (e.g., Peterson et al. 2004) and AGN UV luminosity is found to be strongly
correlated to αox (e.g., Vignali et al. 2003; Strateva et al. 2005; Steffen et al. 2006; Just
et al. 2007). Combining all of these findings, BEff is transitively dependent on all of
these fundamental parameters used to characterize quasars. Therefore, the evolution of
BEff may be related to any of these parameters which exhibits evolution over redshift.
Particularly, the black hole growth over redshift may affect the accretion rate which leads
to a change of the SED shape. This can further cause a change of the ionization structure
of the BLR and eventually result in a change of line emission, which leads to a systematic
change of EW over redshift of a given luminosity. A further investigation of this problem
may require a detailed model of quasar activity combined with observational constraints
of black hole growth (e.g., Small & Blandford 1992; Marconi et al. 2004), which is beyond
the scope of this work.
34
Because of limited redshift coverage, most previous work focus on quasar emission
line and continuum properties at a particular redshift or within a narrow redshift range.
Our work confirms and refines many existing relationships such as the emission line
shift vs. ionization and emission line shift vs. BEff slope relations, over a wider range of
redshift. Both of these new and refined correlations reflect average quasar properties, but
not a small set of selected quasars. Because of this, the conclusions we obtained in this
work are more general. These properties will provide strong constraints to current and
future quasar models, and must be re-produced, as a function of redshift and luminosity,
by successful emission models.

Chapter 3
Probing the Origins of
the C iv and Fe Kα Baldwin Effects
3.1 Introduction
One of the important properties of AGNs is the relation between the emission-
line strength, characterized by the equivalent width (EW), and continuum luminosity,
because it reveals that the regions emitting these two spectral components are asso-
ciated. Baldwin (1977) found that the EW of C iv λ1549 (C iv) is inversely cor-
related with the quasar monochromatic luminosity at 1450 Å, lλ(1450 Å), namely,
log EW(C iv) = k log lν(1450 Å) + b. Carswell & Smith (1978) referred to this trend
as the “Baldwin Effect” (BEff), a designation now widely used to describe line strength-
luminosity relations. Baldwin (1977) identified this relation using only 20 quasi-stellar
objects with 29.8 . log lν(1450 Å) . 32.0 and 1.24 < z < 3.53. Subsequent UV/optical
surveys have enabled investigation of this relation with wider luminosity and redshift
ranges (e.g., Kinney, Rivolo & Koratkar 1990; Zamorani et al. 1992). It has been found
that the BEff exists for not only C iv but many other broad emission lines such as Lyα,
C iii] λ1908, Si iv, Mg ii (Dietrich et al. 2002; Vanden Berk 2011), UV iron emission lines
(Green et al. 2001), and even forbidden lines such as [O ii] and [Ne v] λ3426 (Croom
et al. 2002). Applying a spectral-composite technique (Vanden Berk et al. 2001) to the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; York et al. 2000) Data Release Three (DR3) quasar
catalog (Schneider et al. 2005), Vanden Berk (2011) found that the BEff evolves with
redshift, which is a source of scatter in this relation for a sample with a wide range of
redshift.
The X-ray BEff (or Fe Kα BEff), in which the EW of the narrow Fe Kα line
at 6.4 keV (hereafter abbreviated to Fe Kα) is anti-correlated with X-ray luminosity,
lν(2 keV), was discovered in the early 1990s from observations by the X-ray observatory
Ginga (Iwasawa & Taniguchi 1993). This relation has been subsequently confirmed using
data from ASCA (Tanaka et al. 1994; Nandra et al. 1997) and from Chandra and XMM-
Newton (Page et al. 2004a; Zhou & Wang 2005; Jiang et al. 2006; Bianchi et al. 2007).
Possible sites of origin for narrow Fe Kα emission include the broad emission-line region
(BELR), the outskirts of the accretion disk, and the molecular torus (e.g., Weaver et al.
1992, Antonucci 1993; Krolik, Madau & Zycki 1994).
Although it is well accepted that the BEff exists for many UV/optical emission
lines (e.g., Osmer & Shields 1999; Shields 2007), there is currently no theoretical model
that provides a compelling and complete explanation of this well-known phenomenon.
Several physical explanations have been proposed to account for the UV/optical BEff.
One promising explanation is that the continuum shape may be luminosity depen-
dent. In this model, the UV/optical BEff is due to the softening of the spectral energy
67
distribution (SED) at high luminosity, which lowers the ion populations having high
ionization potentials (Netzer et al. 1992; Korista et al. 1998). It has been found, using
Einstein Observatory data, that the quasar SED, parameterized by αox
1 (Tananbaum
et al. 1979), depends on UV luminosity (e.g., Zamorani et al. 1981). Later research
using radio-quiet (RQ) optically selected quasar samples from the SDSS Early Data Re-
lease (Stoughton et al. 2002) confirmed and extended this result (e.g., Vignali, Brandt &
Schneider 2003). Using optically selected AGNs Strateva et al. (2005) and Steffen et al.
(2006) firmly established the correlation of αox with UV luminosity for these sources.
The idea that the UV/optical BEff is attributable to SED-driven ionization effects is sup-
ported both observationally (Zheng & Malkan 1993; Green 1996, 1998) and theoretically
(Netzer et al. 1992). Recent work on a sample of non-Broad Absorption Line (BAL),
radio-quiet, optically selected quasars indicates that the EW of C iv depends both on
UV and X-ray luminosity. The physics of the C iv BEff is apparently associated with
both UV and X-ray emission (e.g., Gibson, Brandt & Schneider, 2008, hereafter GBS08,
and references therein).
Other proposed BEff drivers include the Eddington ratio, L/LEdd (Baskin & Laor
2004; Bachev et al. 2004; Warner et al. 2004; Zhou & Wang 2005), the black-hole mass
(Netzer et al. 1992; Wandel et al. 1999; Shields 2007), and the luminosity dependence of
metallicity (Warner et al. 2004).
In this paper we investigate the origin of the BEff for the C iv emission line in
a sample of 272 Type 1 AGNs and quasars. Although C iv is not the only UV/optical
broad emission line that exhibits a BEff, we selected it to study this phenomenon not
only because it is a representative and well-accepted BEff emission line, but also because
C iv resides in a relatively clean spectral region where the local continuum can be
well approximated as a single power-law, with few blends with other emission lines
(in particular the iron emission forest) and limited contamination from the AGN host
galaxy. These properties make it relatively straightforward to perform spectral fitting
and obtain accurate emission-line parameters for C iv. We also use partial-correlation
analysis (PCA) and linear-regression regression analysis to investigate the correlations
between EW, monochromatic luminosity, and αox for C iv and narrow Fe Kα emission
lines.
Over the past three decades, there have been a large number of studies of the BEff.
Our work on the C iv/Fe Kα lines combines the following important features (1) a wide
range in redshift (0.009 . z . 4.720) and luminosity (27.81 . log lν(2500 Å) . 33.04)
that allows one to disentangle evolutionary vs. luminosity, so that we are not narrowing
our study for quasars with a particular luminosity or at a certain redshift; (2) a relatively
large sample size (272 objects); (3) the use of partial correlation analysis; and (4) a high
X-ray detection rate (∼ 94%); and (5) estimates of the effects of observational errors
and object variability.

2007).

We describe the sample selection in § 5.2 and the methods used to process the
data in § 3.3. In § 3.4, we perform partial-correlation and linear-regression analyses
to investigate the roles of αox in the C iv and Fe Kα BEffs. In § 3.5, we probe the
connections between C iv and Fe Kα relationships in EWs, fluxes and luminosities.
We present our conclusions in § 3.6. Throughout this work, we adopt the following
cosmology: ΩM = 0.3, ΩΛ = 0.7, H0 = 70 km s
−1 Mpc−1.
3.2 Sample Construction
The quasar sample in our study is drawn from three sources: 50 objects from
Jiang et al. (2006), which will be referred to as “Sample A”; 98 objects from GBS08,
which will be referred to as “Sample B”; and 124 objects from Just et al. (2007), which
is referred to as “Sample C”. We define our “combined sample” as the combination of
these three data sets.
3.2.1 Sample A
Jiang et al. (2006) compiled a dataset of 101 Type 1 AGNs with Fe Kα observa-
tions from both the Chandra and XMM-Newton archives. The detection fraction of the
Fe Kα line in their combined sample is around 55%. The redshifts of the AGNs range
from 0.003 to 3.366, but most of the objects (87%) are low-redshift (z . 0.4) AGNs. The
monochromatic luminosities, lν(2500 Å), range from 10
26.0 to 1031.5 erg s−1 Hz−1. We
chose this dataset because it is the most complete Fe Kα BEff sample with high-quality
data obtained from the most sensitive X-ray missions. However, because the number of
AGNs observed in the X-ray band is much smaller than the number observed optically
and not all X-ray observed AGNs present Fe Kα emission lines, the Fe Kα sample is
significantly limited in size.
We searched for UV/optical spectra of all 101 objects from the archival databases
for HST and IUE. We found 82 spectra covering the wavelength region around the C iv
emission line (containing at least the 1500–1600 Å band). If observations are available
from both HST and IUE, we selected the HST observations due to their generally
higher signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio. For spectra with multiple observations using the
same instrument, we preferentially use spectra with higher S/N.
Next, we excluded all the radio-loud (RL) objects from the core sample, because
additional X-ray emission is produced by the radio jet (e.g., Brinkmann et al. 2000) and
changes the value of αox as well as the slope of the Fe Kα BEff.
We further excluded 3 objects for the following reasons:
• MCG-06-30-15 : The Fe Kα profile of MCG-06-30-15 is well fit using a broad disk
line model (e.g., Tanaka et al. 1995). The narrow component is not well resolved
or very weak. In this work, we only study the narrow component of Fe Kα, so this
object is excluded.
• IC 4329a: The spectrum has low S/N, and the C iv emission line is cannot be
accurately measured (e.g., Crenshaw & Kraemer 2001).
69
• PG 1407+265 : This object was termed as an “unusual” quasar (McDowell et al.
1995) because it contains extremely weak Lyα and C iv lines. Because of its
peculiarity, we exclude it from our sample.
We removed 5 objects with strong associated absorption lines of C iv λ1549:
PG 1411+442 (Wise et al. 2004), NGC 4151 (Crenshaw et al. 1999), Ark 564 (Crenshaw
et al. 1999), NGC 4051 (Collinge et al. 2001), and PG 1114+445 (Shang et al. 2007).
These features prohibit reconstruction of the unabsorbed C iv λ1549 emission-line profile.
The X-ray absorption associated with the UV line absorption (Brandt et al. 2000) might
also lead to an under-prediction of continuum flux at 2 keV and, therefore, an incorrect
estimation of the intrinsic value of αox.
Finally, we exclude 8 objects that are classified as Seyfert 1.5 (Sy 1.5) and Sy 1.9 2
(Osterbrock 1981; Osterbrock & Ferland 1989). These objects are intermediate between
Sy 1 and Sy 2 galaxies and are often subjected to obscuration along the line of sight.
Thus their UV, X-ray luminosities and αox values are also potentially affected.
The final version of Sample A consists of 50 AGNs. Among these objects, 34 are
found in the HST archive (FOS3 or STIS4), and 16 are found in the IUE archive (SWP5
or LWP6). The Fe Kα detection rate is 55%, the same as in the entire Jiang et al. (2006)
study.
3.2.2 Sample B
Objects in Sample B were selected from 536 SDSS DR5 (Adelman-McCarthy
et al. 2007) quasars in GBS08. These quasars, taken from the DR5 Quasar Catalog
(Schneider et al. 2007), are at redshift 1.7 ≤ z ≤ 2.7 and have been observed by Chandra
or XMM-Newton. The lower redshift limit ensures that all SDSS spectra in this sample
cover the C iv region; the upper redshift limit ensures that the rest-frame flux at 2500
Å is covered so that αox can be measured accurately.
We excluded the BAL quasars in Table 1 of GBS08. BAL quasars can have
strong absorption features in the C iv spectral region that prohibit accurate fitting of
the continuum and emission-line profiles. In addition, BALs are usually associated with
relatively strong X-ray absorption (e.g., Brandt, Laor & Wills 2000; Gallagher et al.
2006). We only retain objects with Chandra observations with angular offsets < 10′ to
avoid large X-ray flux uncertainties caused by variations of the point spread function.
This restriction reduces our sample size to 149. In addition, we excluded RL objects
and strong associated absorption-line (AAL) objects. The final version of Sample B
consists of 98 objects with lν(2500 Å) between 10
30.53 and 1031.67 erg s−1 Hz−1. This is
a relatively narrow luminosity range; however, it does provide a significant extension of
Sample A since the latter is mostly composed of low-luminosity and low-redshift AGNs.

3.2.3 Sample C
To examine the relations between αox, lν(2500 Å), and lν(2 keV), Just et al.
(2007) compiled a sample of 372 objects, including 26 from their core sample, 332 from
Steffen et al. (2006), and 14 from Shemmer et al. (2006b). BAL quasars, RL quasars,
and gravitationally lensed objects have already been excluded from this sample. The
gravitationally lensed quasars are removed because their fluxes are strongly amplified
and thus their luminosities are uncertain.
Among the 372 objects, 38 are already in Sample A. For the rest of the AGNs,
we searched for existing spectra with C iv coverage preferentially from SDSS, then the
HST and IUE archives. Finally, we removed 5 AGNs whose spectra contain strong
AALs. These restrictions leave 124 objects in Sample C, in which 91 objects are from
the SDSS DR5 quasar catalog, 13 from the HST archive, and 20 from the IUE archive.
The redshift of this sample ranges from 0.015 to 4.720 and lν(2500 Å) ranges from 10
28.12
to 1032.32 erg s−1 Hz−1.
3.2.4 Combined Sample
The combined sample (Table 3.1) consists of a total of 272 objects: 189 (69.5%)
have spectra from SDSS, 47 (17.3%) from HST, and 36 (13.2%) from IUE. The redshifts
range from 0.009 to 4.720 (Fig. 3.1). The gap between z ∼ 0.5 and z ∼ 1.5 is caused
by instrumentation limitations. Because of the wavelength coverage of the SDSS spec-
trographs, the redshifts of SDSS quasars having C iv coverage must be greater than
1.5. Most intermediate-redshift AGNs (0.5 . z . 1.5) are too faint for their UV/optical
spectra to be taken by IUE and HST. Our sample exhibits a strong redshift-luminosity
correlation (Fig. 3.1); we discuss this issue further in our analyses below.
The lν(2500 Å) of this combined sample ranges between 10
26.53 and 1033.04 erg s−1 Hz−1,
including Seyfert galaxies to the most-luminous quasars in the Universe. The X-ray de-
tection rate is 94.9%. The UV properties of the combined sample as well as the UV and
X-ray properties of Sample A are tabulated in Table 3.2 and Table 3.3. The combined
sample will be used to investigate the C iv BEff, while only Sample A will be used to
study the Fe Kα BEff.
3.3 Data Processing
3.3.1 Bad Pixel Removal and Reddening Correction
To ensure that we use high-quality data to perform the continuum and emission-
line fitting, we remove bad pixels in the SDSS spectra based on the mask column con-
tained in the SDSS quasar spectral files. We removed all the bad pixels in the spectra of
SDSS objects in Sample C.7 The excluded pixels cover less than 10% of the total pixels
for over 98% of SDSS objects, and the maximum fraction of removed pixels for a single
object is 15%.
7For data processing of Sample B, refer to GBS08.
71
We perform Galactic reddening corrections to all the spectra using the E(B −V )
dependent extinction curve of Fitzpatrick (1999). Values of E(B − V ) are calculated
following Schlegel et al. (1998).
3.3.2 Spectral Fitting
3.3.2.1 Sample A
For each UV/optical spectrum from HST or IUE, we fit the local continuum in
the vicinity of C iv (typically 1300–1700 Å) using a single power-law. We do not expect
our measurements to be significantly affected by host-galaxy components because 1) our
sample contains only Type I AGNs and quasars in which emission from the nucleus
dominates the light from host galaxies in the UV band; and 2) C iv is in the UV region
in which the non-nuclear emission primarily arises from massive stars such as O and B
stars. Examination of the spectra does not reveal any stellar absorption lines, indicating
that the contribution from starlight is negligible. We do not subtract the iron emission
forest as this component is usually not strong around the C iv emission line (e.g., Shen
et al. 2008), and the wavelength coverage of the HST and IUE spectra is frequently too
narrow (only a few hundred Angstroms) to fit this component. The Balmer continuum
“small blue bump” only appears in the wavelength range between 2000–4000 Å, so its
contribution is negligible around the C iv region.
The emission-line spectrum is obtained after subtracting the power-law contin-
uum. We fit the C iv emission lines using two Gaussian profiles. The model always
produces visually acceptable fits. We mask narrow absorption-line features appearing
near the emission-lines so as not to under-predict the emission line flux. The equivalent
widths, the emission-line luminosities under the assumption of isotropy, and the contin-
uum monochromatic luminosities at 2500 Å are calculated under our adopted cosmology
and are tabulated in Table 3.2.
To first order, we use 2–10 keV luminosities tabulated in Table 1 of Jiang et al.
(2006) to estimate lν(2 keV) under the assumption that the X-ray continuum is a single
power-law with photon index Γ = 2 from 2 keV to 10 keV (e.g., Page et al. 2005;
Shemmer et al. 2005; Vignali et al. 2005), so that
lν(2 keV) =
L(2–10 keV)
ν2 ln 5
(3.1)
where hν2 = 2 keV and h is Planck’s constant. To obtain the Fe Kα emission-line flux,
we further assume that the Fe Kα emission line resembles a single Gaussian profile:
fl(ν) = A · e−(ν−ν0)
2/2σ2 . This allows one to express the line flux Fl in terms of lν(2 keV)
or F (2–10 keV), the Fe Kα equivalent width EW(Fe Kα), and the central energy (ǫ0 = 6.4
keV) of the emission line. Assuming the continuum flux fc = C · ν−1, we can derive
EW(Fe Kα) =

The approximations are valid because generally ν0 ≫ σ so ν20/2σ

ǫ0(Fe Kα) = 6.4 keV while the width, σ(Fe Kα), is usually . 0.1 keV; as a result,

The Fe Kα EWs, emission-line luminosities, and 2 keV monochromatic luminosities of
Sample A are tabulated in Table 3.3.
3.3.2.2 Sample B
For objects in Sample B, we directly adopt the fitting results from GBS08. In
their paper, the SDSS spectral continua were fit with polynomials, and the C iv emission
lines were fit with Voigt profiles. The different model in GBS08 from our work used to
fit the C iv spectral region will not cause significant differences; because the continuum
around C iv is not contaminated with other emission/absorption lines, the polynomial
fit will produce almost the same result as the simple power-law fit. In addition, since
both multiple Gaussian and Voigt profiles produce acceptable fits to the emission line,
they will give nearly the same line flux. The X-ray spectral continua were fit using a
broken power-law with the power-law break fixed at 2 keV in the rest-frame in order to
obtain lν(2 keV).
3.3.2.3 Sample C
We fit the UV/optical spectra from the SDSS using a routine, described by Vanden
Berk (2011), developed for SDSS quasar spectra. This routine fits the “underlying
continuum” using three components simultaneously: a power-law, the iron emission
forest, and the small blue bump. We adopt the UV iron emission template (1075–
3090 Å) from Vestergaard & Wilkes (2001) and the optical template (3535–7534 Å)
from Véron-Cetty et al. (2004). We first make a preliminary estimate of the power-law
component by connecting two “line-free” points in the spectra. This provides initial
estimates of the power-law parameters for the subsequent comprehensive processing in
which the spectra are fit by considering all three components mentioned above. We
evaluate the fitting quality by calculating χ2 values within some “line-free” windows.
Finally, the continuum fit is subtracted from the original spectrum and the residuals are
used to conduct emission-line fitting. For Sample C, the C iv emission-lines are fit by
superpositions of two Gaussian profiles, which always yields acceptable fits for the data.
We then calculate the C iv EW, emission-line luminosity, and monochromatic luminosity
at 2500 Å (Table 3.2). We adopt the values of αox and 2 keV monochromatic luminosity
from Just et al. (2007).
73
Examples of continuum and emission-line fits of the HST, IUE and SDSS spectra
are presented in Fig. 3.2.
3.3.3 Error Analysis
In order to estimate the uncertainties in the measured quantities for objects in
Samples A and C, we ran Monte Carlo simulations assuming a model with a perfect
correlation between EW(C iv), f(C iv), and fν(2500 Å). For each spectrum, we add
random noise to the original best fit to produce artificial spectra. The random noise
follows a Gaussian distribution, and its amplitude is determined in one of two ways. For
a spectrum from the HST or IUE database, we apply a low band pass filter, filtering
out low-frequency signals via fast Fourier transformation.8 The residual signal is mostly
noise. We then calculate the root-mean-square (RMS) of the noise and take this value as
the random noise amplitude to be added onto the model spectrum. For a spectrum from
the SDSS database, we simply use the uncertainty level associated with each pixel as the
noise amplitude. For each spectrum, we produce 100 artificial spectra and fit them in
exactly the same way as the observed spectrum. The error bar of a spectral parameter
is then calculated as the RMS of 100 fitting results. The typical error bar shown in each
plot (e.g., Fig. 3.3) is the median of all the error bars of points in that plot.
When evaluating the uncertainties of monochromatic luminosities, e.g., lν(2500 Å),
we must consider the contribution from the error in the luminosity distances (important
for the low-redshift objects). To validate this, we calculate the ratio of luminosity un-
certainties without considering distance errors (δf ; the error in the flux measurement) to
luminosity uncertainties after considering distance errors (δf,d) for objects in Sample A,
and denote it as δf/δf,d, in which f stands for flux and d stands for distance. Assuming
that the square of total uncertainty can be expressed as the quadratic summation of
the uncertainties of flux and distance individually, the square of the ratio, (δf/δf,d)
2, is
more relevant than the ratio itself. We find that there are 5 out of 50 objects (in Sample
A) whose ratios are above 0.1; three of them are even greater than 0.5. These objects
have very low redshifts but large redshift uncertainties (δz > 0.001). For consistency,
it is necessary to include the distance into the gross uncertainty calculation for all the
objects in our samples. These uncertainties are also estimated using a Monte Carlo
method. We adopt the most accurate values of redshift and their uncertainties from the
NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database.9 These uncertainties are treated as noise ampli-
tudes to be added to the redshift values. The luminosity uncertainties are calculated
using the following error-propagation equation:
δL = 4πdL
√
(dLδf)
2 + 4f2 (δdL)
2
We adopt a 20% uncertainty for each X-ray continuum luminosity, e.g., lν(2 keV);
their measurement errors are not available in the literature. The relative uncertainty
varies considerably depending on the number of X-ray counts. For Sample A, when
8http://www.msi.umn.edu/software/idl/tutorial/idl-signal.html
9http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/
74
the Fe Kα emission lines are detected, the total number of counts is at least ∼ 500.
The Fe Kα emission-line luminosity and flux errors are calculated using the maximum
error estimates. For instance, the upper bound of L(Fe Kα) is calculated using the
upper bounds of both EW(Fe Kα) and L(2–10 keV); the upper bound of f(Fe Kα)
is calculated using the upper bound of L(Fe Kα) and the lower bound of luminosity
distance dL − δdL. This uncertainty ignores any systematic uncertainty produced by
errors in the cosmological model.
For Sample B, because the parameter uncertainties are not given in GBS08, we
simply apply a 20% uncertainty for all luminosity values as a first-order approximation.
3.4 Drivers of the C iv Baldwin Effect
3.4.1 Comparison with Previous Work
We will first examine some important relations to determine if our measurements
are consistent with previous work. It has been argued that αox has no detectable redshift
dependence (e.g., Strateva et al. 2005; Steffen et al. 2006; but see Kelly et al. 2007), so
in this paper we neglect any redshift evolution of αox.
Fig. 3.3 displays the plot of EW(C iv) against lν(2500 Å) for the combined sample,
distinguished by luminosity. We use the monochromatic luminosity at 2500 Å rather
than the traditional BEff wavelength (1450 Å) because our choice is more convenient to
compare the BEff with the correlation between C iv and αox. The luminosities at these
two wavelengths are well correlated. The quantity f1400/f2500 is Gaussian distributed
with a dispersion of σ ∼ 0.15 (Fig. 3 in Gibson et al. 2009), so using lν(2500 Å) instead of
lν(1450 Å) should only add a small dispersion to the data points but will not significantly
affect the slope of the BEff. We fit the data points linearly in logarithmic space using the
EM (Expectation-Maximization) method (Dempster, Laird & Rubin 1977; Table 3.4).
It is clear that EW(C iv) decreases with lν(2500 Å) (Fig. 3.3).
It has been reported that the slope of the BEff becomes steeper for high-luminosity
quasars. For example, Dietrich et al. (2002) obtained a C iv BEff slope (−0.14 ± 0.02),
which was shallower than the value reported in previous studies (−0.22 ± 0.05, Green
1996; also see Osmer, Porter & Green 1994; Laor et al. 1995). Using only the EW(C iv)
measurements for their high-luminosity subsample with λLλ(1450 Å) & 10
44 erg s−1,
Dietrich et al. (2002) obtained a steeper slope of the BEff of −0.20 ± 0.03 for C iv. To
investigate the slope change with luminosity, we fit our data points with lν(2500 Å)<
30.5. We find that the slope of the low-luminosity sample is consistent with the slope
of the entire sample within 1 σ (Table 3.4). Therefore, although our dataset exhibits a
suggestive trend which disagrees with Dietrich et al. (2002), we do not find significant
changes of slope over luminosity.
The large scatter in the BEff could have several causes, including observational
error, intrinsic variation of the BEff (Osmer & Shields 1999; Shields 2007 and references
therein), luminosity dependence of the BEff slope, and the redshift dependence of the
BEff. Vanden Berk et al. (2009, in preparation) found that the slope of the BEff does
not change across redshift, but its scaling factor (or equivalently, the EW of a broad
emission line at a fixed monochromatic luminosity) exhibits a significant change Our
75
BEff slope is an overall average across the redshift and luminosity range we covered;
remember that there is a strong redshift-luminosity correlation in our sample.
We examined the lν(2500 Å)-lν(2 keV) and lν(2500 Å)-αox relations for both
Sample A and the combined sample using survival analysis (ASURV, Lavalley, Isobe &
Feigelson, 1992) if censored data are involved, and find that all the results are consistent
with previous work. When we calculate the slope of the Fe Kα BEff, we apply the
Buckley-James method (Table 3.4, Buckley & James 1979; Lavalley, Isobe & Feigelson
1992) included in ASURV to perform linear regression because the EW(Fe Kα) contains
censored values. The slope of the Fe Kα BEff of Sample A (−0.115±0.062) is consistent
with the result from the RQ sample (−0.102 ± 0.052) in Jiang et al. (2006).
3.4.2 The Effects of αox on the C iv and Fe Kα BEffs
Fig. 3.4 shows the plot of EW(C iv) against αox for the combined sample; the
regression result from the EM algorithm for the linear relation is
log EW(C iv) = (1.035 ± 0.075)αox + (3.301 ± 0.119) (3.5)
and the Spearman correlation coefficient is 0.607 (P0 < 0.001).
10 Because αox is an indi-
cator of the hardness of the SED which controls the ionization level of C iv surrounding
the central engine, Fig. 3.4 demonstrates that as the ionizing flux becomes harder (αox
increases), the C iv emission has a strong positive response to αox.
Both αox and lν(2500 Å) are correlated with EW(C iv); which is a more fundamen-
tal driver? To investigate this issue, we applied PCA to EW(C iv), lν(2500 Å), and αox
using the combined sample, Sample A, and a reduced sample. Table 3.5 presents Pear-
son, Spearman, and Kendall’s correlation and partial-correlation coefficients (if avail-
able), along with significance levels for these three samples. We present the statistical
results of Sample A for comparing the correlation results of C iv and Fe Kα. Because
the combined sample contains censored data for the αox values, we must use survival
analysis to calculate the correlation coefficients. However, algorithms are not available
for calculating all the correlation and partial-correlation coefficients for censored data.
For example, the empty entries in Table 3.5 are due to the unavailability of correspond-
ing algorithms. In order to compare the changes of correlation strength when the third
parameter is controlled, we construct a reduced sample with the censored data removed,
considering that this only excludes a small fraction (∼ 6%) of the entire data set and
should not affect the statistical properties of the sample. We can see that the C iv BEff
is significantly weakened when αox is held fixed; the correlation coefficient drops from
−0.580 to −0.224 (Spearman). On the other hand, the correlation coefficient between
EW(C iv) and αox also drops significantly when lν(2500 Å) is held fixed, from 0.615 to
0.332. This implies that both αox and lν(2500 Å) are driving the change of EW(C iv).
The Fe Kα BEff plot (not shown) of our sample (Sample A) is very similar to
the correlation shown of Fig. 4 in Jiang et al. (2006) except that our sample size is
smaller. Fig. 3.5 shows EW(Fe Kα) plotted against αox. The Spearman test gives a
10P0 is the confidence level of the null hypothesis. Therefore, the smaller P0 is the more likely
the correlation exists.
76
much weaker correlation coefficient (−0.230 with P0 = 0.111) than that for C iv (−0.304
with P0 < 0.001). In addition, simple χ
2 fitting produces a slope of 0.046 ± 0.154,
consistent with zero. The consistency between the correlation analysis and regression
result provides strong evidence that EW(Fe Kα) is not correlated with αox.
3.4.3 Effects of AGN Variability on BEff Relation Scatter
Because of the ubiquity of AGN variability, combined with the different times of
the optical and X-ray observations, our values of αox do not reflect the spectral hardness
at a specific time but are randomly distributed around their mean values. The deviation
of αox from its mean value would be ∼ 0.083, assuming that the variation amplitudes
are 30% for lν(2500 Å) and 40% for lν(2 keV) (e.g., Strateva et al. 2005, GBS08).
To check how much of the scatter of our correlations could be attributed to
variability, we performed two simple tests on our combined sample. We follow the
method used in § 3.1 of GBS08 and introduce ∆ log EW, which is the difference between
the observed EW(C iv) and the EW calculated from linear regression (Eq. 3.7), i.e.,
∆ log EW = log EW− log EW(lν(2500 Å)). We define µ and σ as the mean and disper-
sion of the distribution of ∆ log EW. To calculate µ and σ, we maximize the likelihood
function (Maccacaro et al. 1988):
L =
∏
i
1
√
2π
(
σ2
i
+ σ2
)
exp
[
− (∆ log EWi − µ)2 /2(σ2i + σ
2)
]
(3.6)
in which the subscript i represents each object and σi is the uncertainty of ∆ log EW
associated with each ∆ log EWi. The maximization of L requires µ = 0.01 and σ = 0.23.
Next, we estimate the potential scatter of ∆ log EW due to variability. We need
to consider two terms: log EW and log EW(lν(2500 Å)). To first approximation, EW ∼
fline/fcont in which fline is the emission-line flux and the fcont is the continuum flux. The
emission-line variability of six luminous quasars at z = 2.2–3.2 was recently reported by
Kaspi et al. (2007). The mean fractional variation Fvar
11 is ≈ 0.096 by averaging the
fractional variation of C iv λ1549 of all six quasars. The C iv emission-line variability
of a number of Seyfert galaxies has been studied, including Fairall 9 (Rodriguez-Pascual
et al. 1997), NGC 5548 (Clavel et al. 1991), NGC 7469 (Wanders et al. 1997), NGC 3783
(Reichert et al. 1994), and 3C 390.3 (O’Brien et al. 1998). By averaging the fractional
variations of Seyferts and quasars above, we obtain an average emission-line variation
〈Fvar〉 = 0.130. The typical variation of lν(2500 Å) is ∼ 30% (e.g., Strateva et al. 2005).
Therefore, the scattering of log EW contributed from variability is estimated (assuming
all independent variables are Gaussian distributed) as

11Fvar is defined as the RMS of the intrinsic variability relative to the mean flux (Rodriguez-
Pascual et al. 1997).
77
In the calculation above, a = 0.198 (Eq. (3.7)). This exercise indicates that at least 60%
of the scatter around the BEff in our sample can be attributed to AGN variability.
We performed a similar test for the αox-EW(C iv) relation. Because the set of
αox contains censored data, we can only use the reduced data set (258 objects). The
maximization of L (Eq. 3.6) yields µ = 0.01 and σ = 0.22. The potential dispersion of
this relation assuming all scatter comes from variability is estimated (assuming Gaussian
distributions) as
σ (∆ log EW) =

In the calculation above, a = 1.035 (Eq. 3.5). This indicates that variability produces at
least 75% of the scatter around the αox-EW(C iv) relationship.
In summary, the above two tests demonstrate that a substantial fraction, if not
the majority, of the scatter in the correlations above can be attributed to X-ray and
UV/optical variability. It should be possible to make the correlations tighter if the
UV/optical and X-ray data are observed simultaneously.
3.4.4 Regressions of EW and Luminosity
The BEff provides a potential avenue to infer the luminosity of a quasar from
emission-line observations. Type Ia supernovae (SNe) are treated as classical standard
candles (e.g., Phillips 1993; Burrows 2000), but only a few are observed beyond z ∼
1.5. If quasars, which are much easier to detect than SNe and can be observed to
much a higher redshift, can be used as standard candles, they would be an important
tool for cosmological studies. Soon after the discovery of the BEff, many investigations
considered the possibility of treating emission-line EW as a luminosity indicator (e.g.,
Baldwin 1977; Wampler 1980). Unfortunately, the C iv BEff usually has a large scatter
(Osmer & Shields 1999; Shields 2007); given the small slope in the log EW-log lν plot
(on the order of −0.2), the predicted luminosities are very inaccurate. It has also been
shown that the C iv BEff is redshift dependent (Francis & Koratkar 1995; Vanden Berk
et al. 2009, in preparation), making it a less valuable probe of cosmology.
Because we are focusing on the influence of αox at the moment, and will put
the redshift factor aside, we will concentrate on the issue of whether the scatter can be
reduced if we regress EW(C iv) with lν(2500 Å) and/or αox, and if the prediction of
luminosity can be made more accurate with this approach. The linear-regression results
of EW(C iv) with αox are already shown in Eq.(3.5). Similar regressions from lν(2500 Å)
and both of lν(2500 Å) and αox, using the fully parametric EM algorithm, are
log EW(C iv) = (−0.198 ± 0.015) log lν(2500 Å) + (7.764 ± 0.461) (3.7)
log EW(C iv) = (−0.107 ± 0.021) log lν(2500 Å) + (0.615 ± 0.106)αox + (5.944 ± 0.536).
(3.8)
78
in which EW(C iv) is in Å and lν(2500 Å) is in erg s
−1 Hz−1. The last regression was
performed on the combined sample without the censored data (258 objects) because the
EM algorithm in ASURV does not allow both independent variables to contain censored
data points.
To evaluate the scatter, we subtract the predicted EW values calculated using the
above equations from the observed values and compute the RMS values of the residuals.
We see a slight improvement of the RMS values, using αox and both lν(2500 Å)+αox
(Table 3.6). The last regression result (Eq.(3.8)) is consistent with Eq.(11) in GBS08,
indicating that at least part of the scatter of the BEff is due to αox.
Next, we regress luminosity against EW(C iv) and/or αox, using the combined
sample. The results are
log lν(2500 Å) = (−1.980 ± 0.154) log EW(C iv) + (34.076 ± 0.256) (3.9)
log lν(2500 Å) = (−0.852± 0.168) log EW(C iv)− (2.864± 0.262)αox + (27.668 ± 0.635).
(3.10)
The last regression was performed on the censored-data-excluded sample. We then calcu-
late the RMS values of the residuals after subtracting the predictions from the equations
above (Table 3.6). The RMS value shrinks by 18% using EW(C iv)+αox, compared to
using EW(C iv) alone. We use the standard F -test to check if the two sets of residuals
have consistent variance. The testing gives an F -statistic of 1.48 with a significance
0.002, indicating that these two sets of residuals have significantly different variances
and 18% is a statistically significant improvement. To use quasars as standard candles
via the BEff, we should at least confine the luminosity within an uncertainty of 30%,
or, equivalently, rms < 0.1. This cannot be achieved using our current dataset and
controlled parameters.
3.5 Relation Between Fe Kα and C iv
Fe Kα is important in AGN studies because it is the strongest emission line ap-
pearing in the X-ray band. However, the strength of this emission line varies significantly
from object to object, and the line is not detected in most X-ray observations of quasars.
Given this lack of direct observational measurement, it would be useful to develop a way
to predict the expected strength of the line empirically.
The EW(C iv) and EW(Fe Kα) do not exhibit a significant correlation (Fig. 3.6)
in Sample A; the correlation has a low Spearman rank-correlation coefficient (0.319 with
P0 = 0.027). Although the EWs of the two lines are not well correlated, their luminosities
and fluxes are strongly correlated (Fig. 3.7), with Spearman correlation coefficients 0.529
(P0 < 0.001) and 0.551 (P0 < 0.001), respectively (Table 3.7). The linear correlations
regressed in Fig. 3.7 are
log L(Fe Kα) = (0.588 ± 0.079) log L(C iv) + (16.164 ± 3.416) (3.11)
log f(Fe Kα) = (0.978 ± 0.188) log f(C iv) − (2.082 ± 2.228). (3.12)
79
One must always question the significance of relations such as (3.11) because
even if there is no correlation between the observed fluxes of the lines, the fact that the
line luminosities for a given object contain the same distance factor will introduce an
apparent correlation in the luminosities. To investigate whether this effect is important
for our study, we perform a test in which we conduct correlation and regression analysis
for a sub-sample of Sample A. Objects in this sub-sample have similar redshifts, and thus
they have approximately the same distances. First, we use objects with 0.06 < z < 0.09
because this redshift bin contains a large number of objects. This sub-sample contains
10 objects. The correlation coefficient of f(Fe Kα)-f(C iv) is 0.624 (P0 = 0.061) and of
L(Fe Kα)-L(C iv) is 0.709 (P0 = 0.033). The regression results are
log L(Fe Kα) = (0.748 ± 0.200) log L(C iv) + (9.330 ± 8.702) (3.13)
log f(Fe Kα) = (0.771 ± 0.241) log f(C iv) − (4.280 ± 2.819). (3.14)
Both the correlation and regression results of this sub-sample are consistent with the
results of the entire sample within uncertainties, suggesting that the luminosity correla-
tion of the C iv and Fe Kα lines may be real and is not a consequence of multiplying the
two fluxes of a given object by the same large distance factor. The luminosity of C iv
emission line increases faster than the luminosity of Fe Kα.
One might be concerned that the correlation between L(Fe Kα) and L(C iv)
is artificial because the calculation of the Fe Kα measurements involves L(2–10 keV)
(Eq. (3.4)), which is proportional to lν(2 keV) (Eq. (3.1)), and lν(2 keV) is correlated
with lν(2500 Å), which is correlated with EW(C iv), i.e., the C iv BEff. EW(C iv) is
calculated from continuum and emission line luminosity, so apparently, the L(Fe Kα) and
L(C iv) are not independent before we perform the correlation. However, our calculation
of Fe Kα is simply reversing the F (2–10 keV)/EW calculation of Jiang et al. (2006), so
F (Fe Kα) is not actually dependent of F (2–10 keV) and hence lν(2500 Å). In essence,
we have the values of F (Fe Kα) independent of F (C iv). Therefore, our L(Fe Kα)
and L(C iv) correlation, which is expected from existing relations, is not an artifact
correlation.
That the EWs of C iv and Fe Kα are uncorrelated is consistent with the result
by Page et al. (2004a) and further demonstrates that the C iv and Fe Kα emission lines
are unlikely to have the same origin. This result is not surprising because Fe Kα and
C iv are produced in different processes. The correlation between their luminosities
is probably a combination of effects between their EWs (uncorrelated) and continuum
(strongly correlated). The flux correlation, although empirical and not very tight, is a
useful first order estimation of the Fe Kα line flux given the UV spectra in the rest-frame
of an AGN.
3.6 Discussions and Conclusions
We have compiled a sample of 272 Type 1 AGNs and quasars that have UV and
X-ray measurements, among which Fe Kα emission lines are detected in 50 objects. The
sample covers a wide range of redshift (0.009 . z . 4.720), and a wide range of luminosity
from Seyfert galaxies to the most-luminous quasars (27.81 . log lν(2500 Å) . 33.04).
80
These properties allow us to study the overall properties of AGNs rather than focusing
on a particular redshift or luminosity. It also has a high X-ray detection rate (∼ 96%),
which lets us obtain robust statistics. We have performed correlation and regression
analyses using this sample and draw the following conclusions:
1. The C iv BEff is driven by both αox and lν(2500 Å), or equivalently, by lν(2 keV)
and lν(2500 Å). This implies that changes in the ionizing flux induce changes in
the ionization state of the BELR, producing more C iv ions when the SED be-
comes harder and vice versa. This is supported both by correlation and regression
analyses:
• The partial correlation between EW(C iv) and lν(2500 Å) when αox is con-
trolled is weaker than the regular correlation between EW(C iv) and lν(2500 Å).
• The scatter in the linear regression decreases when we regress EW with
αox+lν(2500 Å) compared with lν(2500 Å) alone.
Although the reduction of the scatter due to adding another regression parameter
is not sufficiently large to treat quasars as standard candles, it demonstrates that a
significant fraction of the scatter attributes to αox, and can be reduced by including
it in regression analysis.
2. EW(Fe Kα) exhibits no strong correlation with either αox or EW(C iv). This
implies that Fe Kα is not likely to have the same origin as C iv.
3. There may be a correlation between the luminosities of Fe Kα and C iv with a
logarithmic slope of 0.588±0.079. This correlation is possibly because both of these
two quantities involve a factor related to the scale of the line emitting regions and
the slope indicates that the C iv emission line luminosity increases faster than the
Fe Kα.
Although αox is a fundamental influence on EW(C iv), there is still a significant scatter in
the EW(C iv)-αox diagram. As we have demonstrated, most of the scatter is contributed
by variability, but another likely contribution source is the nature of αox which only
connects the flux points at 2500 Å and 2 keV but misses the Big Blue Bump, which is
expected to play an important role in the photoionization process. The shape of an AGN
SED can be very different depending on Eddington ratio (Lbol/LEdd) but still have a
fairly constant αox (Vasudevan & Fabian 2007). It is perhaps more appropriate to use a
point near ∼ 250 Å instead of 2500 Å to calculate a revised αox (Shemmer et al. 2008).
This new αox might be more strongly correlated with EW(C iv). However, this requires
challenging observations that cannot be achieved at present for most AGNs.

A Quasar Catalog with Simultaneous UV, Optical
and X-ray Observations by Swift
4.1 Introduction
Variability is a ubiquitous phenomenon for quasars (e.g., Matthews & Sandage
1963; Smith & Hoffleit 1963; Gaskell & Klimek 2003; Wilhite et al. 2005, 2006; Meusinger
et al. 2011) and has been observed from radio, infrared, UV/optical, X-ray and even γ-
ray bands (e.g., Kovalev et al. 2002; Sakata et al. 2010; Park et al. 2010; Grupe et al.
2010; Rieger & Aharonian 2008). While variability provides considerable information on
the length scales of the quasar central engine and can be utilized to estimate the mass
of the central super massive black hole (e.g., Peterson et al. 2004), it is a significant
source of scatter to many correlations. Specifically, flux observed at a given frequency
may change over time, so when you combine fluxes observed in different wavebands, the
combined spectral shape may not represent the spectral shape at a specific time. It
is therefore essential to take simultaneous observations in multi-wavebands in order to
understand the true spectral shape.
The dispersion in multi-waveband correlations produced by variability can be
estimated. For example, it is estimated that at least 60% of the dispersion of the Baldwin
Effect and at least 75% of the EW(C iv)-αox relation can be attributed to variability
(Wu et al. 2009). However, a program of simultaneous observations at multi-wavebands
to verify that the dispersions can be reduced has not yet been performed. In this work,
we will use simultaneous UV/optical and X-ray observations of serendipitous quasars to
study quasar SEDs and dispersions caused by variability.
Because the Swift is designed for detecting and observing Gamma-ray bursts,
there are only a few quasars at the pointing centers. However, the relatively large FOVs
of both the UVOT and XRT allow coverages of a number of serendipitous objects. The
SDSS DR5 quasar catalog contains 77,429 quasars in 5,740 deg2; the UVOT FOV is
17′ × 17′, so there is approximately 1 quasar per UVOT field. Based on this estimation,
we match the Swift pointings with SDSS DR5 quasar catalog with a matching radius
of 20′. In this work, we use the Swift pointing results from launch through June, 2008
(∼ 3.5 years).
Catalogs using similar strategies were constructed by Tueller et al. (2008) and
Grupe et al. (2010). Our work is unique in terms of the selection criteria and sample
size. The sample in Tueller et al. (2008) contains 153 9-month hard X-ray (14–195 keV)
selected local AGNs with a mean redshift of ∼ 0.03. Because this sample is selected using
the hard X-ray band which is much more penetrating to obscuration than UV/optical
and soft X-ray photons, it provides a homogeneous sample to study UV/optical and/or
X-ray faint AGNs. Using this sample, Winter et al. (2009) estimated the fraction of
96
“Hidden” AGNs (Ueda et al. 2007) in the local universe to be ∼ 24%. The sample in
Grupe et al. (2010) contains 92 soft X-ray selected AGNs with redshift ranging from
0.002 to 0.349. Due to their selection criteria, objects in this sample are X-ray bright
Type 1 AGNs with few (< 10%) radio loud (RL; e.g., 3C 273) and Seyfert 1.5 objects
(e.g., Mkn 841; see Wilkes et al. 1999). Using this sample, they constructed composite
AGN SEDs using simultaneous observations from Swift. By fitting these SEDs using two
different models, they attempted to constrain AGN bolometric corrections (BCs). They
found a strong correlation between UV and X-ray spectral indices, namely αUV and αX
1
for AGNs with αX > −1.6. Because their sample contains a large fraction of narrow line
Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies, they were also able to study differences of broad line Seyfert 1
(BLS1) galaxies and NLS1 galaxies in terms of αUV–Lbol/LEdd relation.
As a result of the detection limits in their selected wavebands, both of the above
samples are limited to nearby AGNs and relatively small sample sizes. Our sample is
optically selected. The raw catalog after matching the SDSS quasar catalog and the Swift
pointings contains 1034 quasars, which is almost an order of magnitude larger than either
previous samples. The redshift of our sample ranges from 0 to ∼ 5. Figure 4.1 shows the
distribution of our quasar sample in the luminosity (represented by absolute magnitude)–
redshift diagram. The distribution of our sample in this diagram is consistent with SDSS
DR5 quasar catalog. This sample allows us to expand the quasar SED study to high
redshift.
One of the prominent features in the AGN SED is the big blue bump (BBB) in
the extreme UV (EUV) energy band, which is believed to be produced by the thermal
emission from the accretion disk (e.g., Shields 1978). Because of strong Galactic and
(possibly) intrinsic absorption, it is almost impossible to observe this wavelength region.
On the other hand, this feature is likely to be an important contributor to quasar bolo-
metric luminosity. Based on the observed data in UV/optical and X-ray bands, we can
place some constraints to the flux contribution this feature. Grupe et al. (2010) compiled
a catalog of ∼ 100 quasars with simultaneous observations from Swift and constrained
the BBB. However, quasars in their sample are at low redshift (z < 0.4). In contrast,
over 50% of quasars in our sample are at z & 1. As an extension of their work, we will
attempt to constrain the BBB feature based on observations of quasars are much higher
redshifts.
It should be emphasized that we are not repeating the work by Elvis et al. (1994)
and Richards et al. (2006). Instead, we are attempting to use simultaneously observed
data to constrain the BBB. This component, because of lack of observational data, is
usually represented as a power-law connecting a UV flux point, such as 2500 Å, and an
X-ray point, such as 2 keV (e.g., Richards et al. 2006). The slope determined by these
two points is defined as αox (Tananbaum et al. 1979), so that
αOX =
log lν(2 keV)/lν(2500 Å)
log ν(2 keV)/ν(2500 Å)
= 0.3838 log
[
lν(2 keV)/lν(2500 Å)
]
. (4.1)
1In Grupe et al. (2010), both αUV and αX are defined based on fν ∝ ν−αν . In our work, we
define them as fν ∝ ν+αν .
97
This parameter is generally used to characterize the spectral hardness between UV and
X-ray band (e.g., Avni & Tananbaum 1982, 1986; Anderson & Margon 1987; Wilkes
et al. 1994; Vignali et al. 2003; Strateva et al. 2005; Steffen et al. 2006; Just et al. 2007).
A long-standing problem about the measurement of αox is that it is difficult to obtain
simultaneous measurements of an object in the X-ray and UV/optical. Source variability
introduces scatter into measurements of αox. The simultaneous nature of our observation
will remove the uncertainty.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 4.2, we describe the observations
and data processing; in Section 4.3, we present our data processing results, including
the UV/optical light curves, and the composite SED for each quasar; in Section 4.4,
we present our final catalog and describe the catalog format; in Section 4.5, we select a
sample of quasars from this catalog to study the dispersion of the αox–lν(2500 Å) relation.
Finally, in Section 4.6, we summarize this catalog and our conclusions. Throughout this
work, we adopt the following cosmology: ΩM = 0.3, ΩΛ = 0.7, H0 = 70 km s
−1 Mpc−1.
4.2 Observations and Data Processing
The catalog is constructed in the following steps.
1. Construct the raw catalog by matching SDSS quasar catalog to Swift pointings.
2. Process XRT data to obtain X-ray spectra and parameters.
3. Process UVOT data to obtain UV/optical photometry.
4. Supplement UV/optical data from other resources.
5. Create quasar SEDs.
6. Calculate parameters for each quasar and generate the final catalog.
The raw catalog is constructed by matching 3.5 years Swift pointings and SDSS DR5
quasar catalog and contains 1034 objects (see Section 4.1). We briefly introduces the
Swift instruments before describing the processing steps in details.
4.2.1 Instruments
The Swift Gamma-ray Burst Explorer (Gehrels et al. 2004), with three major
instruments on board, provides an ideal facility for observing simultaneous observations
in UV/optical and X-ray bands. Swift instruments include the Burst Alert Telescope
(BAT; Barthelmy et al. 2005), the X-ray Telescope (XRT; Burrows et al. 2005) and
the Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope (UVOT; Roming et al. 2005).
The BAT is a highly sensitive, large field of view (FOV) instrument designed
to provide critical GRB triggers and 4′ position accuracy. It has a 1.4 sr FOV (half
coded), with an energy range of 15–150 keV for imaging with a non-coded response
up to 500 keV. The XRT is a focusing X-ray telescope with 23′ FOV, 18′′ resolution
(half-power diameter), and 0.2–10 keV energy range. It is designed for measuring fluxes,
spectra and light curves of GRBs and afterglows over a dynamic range covering more
98
than 7 orders of magnitude in flux. XRT supports three readout modes: 1) Imaging
mode is only used to position bright sources up to 7× 10−7 erg cm−2 s−1. 2) Windowed
timing mode can achieve high time resolution (2.2 ms) and bright source spectroscopy
through rapid CCD readout, but has a relatively low positioning resolution; it is most
useful for sources with flux below ∼ 10−7 erg cm−2 s−1. 3) Photon-counting mode
permits full spectral and spatial information for low flux sources ranging from 2× 10−14
to 2 × 10−11 erg cm−2 s−1. In this work, we only use XRT observations in photon-
counting mode because most objects in our catalog are serendipitous quasars with low
X-ray flux. The UVOT (Roming et al. 2005) is based on the Optical Monitor on board
the XMM-Newton space X-ray observatory (Mason et al. 1996). It is co-aligned with
XRT with a 30 cm diameter primary mirror and a FOV of 17′ × 17′. The six filters
carried by UVOT and their basic characteristics can be found in Table 1 of Poole et al.
(2008).
4.2.2 XRT Data
We process the XRT data using the standard pipeline routine xrtpipeline Version
0.12.4 (Released on 2009-08-25). This routine stacks all the available XRT sky images
for each observational segment (identified by an observational ID, hereafter OBSID) and
generates a composite event file with an associated exposure map. In case of multiple
event files for one OBSID, we use the one observed in photon counting mode and with
the longest exposure. In most cases, the discarded event files are exposed for only tens
of seconds and are essentially useless for our study.
In the second step, we define source and background region files for every XRT
sky image of an individual object. The quasar coordinates are adopted from SDSS DR5
quasar catalog. The source and background region circles are defined in the sky image
with the longest exposure. These regions are then visually inspected to ensure that they
can be applied to each sky image with shorter exposures. While we keep the same source
region circle, the position and size of the background region circle is adjusted so that it
is applicable to all sky images covering this object. We exclude sky images in which the
source region is not or only partially inside the FOV or not covered by all the observing
frames. We also discard sky images in which the target source is severely contaminated
by nearby X-ray sources. Depending on the brightness of the X-ray source, the source
region radius is adjusted to be large enough to ensure that the photon density at the
border is at the same level as the background region file. We correspondingly adjust the
background region circle so that the radius is at least four times as large as the source
region circle.
In the next step, event files in each OBSID are processed using XSelect (V2.4a).
We use this software to filter out suspect photons and only keep photons between 0.3
and 10 keV in the observed frame. We then create an auxiliary response file (ARF) for
each OBSID using xrtmkarf (Version 0.5.6). The ARF file deals with filter transmission,
vignetting, effective area and point spread function (PSF) using the standard response
matrix. It also automatically removes “hot columns”, which decrease the effective expo-
sure time. The response matrix file (RMF) we use is swxpc0to12s0 20010101v011.rmf.
The calibration database (CalDB) version is CALDB-4.3.0. We flag each quasar based
99
on the number of X-ray photon counts (NXph): g (good with NXph > 100), a(acceptable
with 10 < NXph ≤ 100), and w (weak with NXph ≤ 10).
On August 30th, 2007 (at 14:28 UT), the CCD substrate voltage was raised from
Vss = 0 V to Vss = 6 V. The change was made in order to reduce the thermally-induced
dark current in the CCD, which allows the XRT to collect useful science data at slightly
higher temperatures (3 to 4◦C) than was possible before the change. The first set of PC
RMFs are un-broadened RMFs, and they are the same as those issued from launch to
February 28th, 2007 (swxpc0to12s0 20010101v011.rmf and swxpc0s0 20010101v011.rmf ).
The second and the third sets of PC RMFs, including an epoch-dependent broadened
kernel, should be used for data collected from March 1st, 2007 to August 31st, 2007
(swxpc0to12s0 20070301v011.rmf and swxpc0s0 20070301v011.rmf ) and from Septem-
ber 1st, 2007 onwards ( swxpc0to12s6 20070901v011.rmf and swxpc0s6 20070901v011.rmf ).
Because we are only using data collected in photon counting mode, we do not need to
deal with the response matrix function of data collected in window timing mode. The
details regarding to response function file changes can be seen from http://www.swift.
ac.uk/Gain\ RMF\ releases.html. According to the changes above, strictly, we should
group OBSIDs observed in the same period and process each period separately using their
corresponding RMF files. However, because we only fit the X-ray continuum, the line
profile broadening will not significantly affect our fitting results, so we do not distinguish
RMFs in different periods.
Next, we read all the available event files and extract photons from the source and
background regions, respectively. We also generate the ARF file for the composite event
file using addarf (Version 1.2.6). The X-ray energy spectrum is binned using grppha
(Version 3.0.1). The binning strategy and the statistical method we use are described in
Table 4.1. Basically, χ2 statistics are used if the X-ray photon count (NXph) is greater
than 100 so that on average, each bin contains at least 10 photons and there are at least
10 bins. If NXph drops below 100, we do not bin the spectrum so as not to lose spectral
information, but use Cash statistics (Cash 1979). If NXph < 10, we do not generate
energy spectra but only estimate flux upper limits. At the end of this step, 103 objects
are flagged as good (g), 296 are flagged as acceptable (a) and 406 are flagged as weak
(w).
The X-ray energy spectrum is fit using XSPEC (Arnaud 1996; Version 12.5.1n).
For each object with NXph & 10, we fit the X-ray spectrum with four models (Table 4.2).
The H i Galactic column density, NH,G, is obtained using the HEASARC nh command
which calculates NH,G based on the Leiden/Argentine/Bonn (Lab) survey of Galactic
H i (Hartmann & Burton 1997; Kalberla et al. 2005). We visually inspect the fitting
quality and select the model that produces the best constraint and quality. During this
visual inspection process, we must balance parameter constraints and degree of freedom
(DOF). If parameter constraints from a more flexible model are too loose, we favor a
simpler model with a low DOF because it provides tighter parameter constraints. For
example, in most of cases, the intrinsic column density NH,i from Model C is consistent
with zero so we choose Model B, because this model produces much tighter constraints
to the flux level and photon index. In general, we consistently apply the following rules
to select the model.
100
1. If NXph < 30, use Model A. In this case, it is impossible to constrain the intrinsic
absorption and the constraint on Γ is very poor (δΓ & 0.5). Therefore, we decide
to fit the flux levels and fix Γ = 2.
2. If 30 ≤ NXph < 100, there are two possible situations.
• If the intrinsic column density NH,i is inconsistent with zero and well con-
strained, choose Model D. Although NH,i is also set to be free in Model C, we
do not choose this model because constraints NH,i and other parameters are
very poor due to a small NXph.
• If NH,i is consistent with zero, and Γ is well constrained (δΓ < 0.5), choose
Model B. If Γ is not well constrained, choose Model A.
3. In case of NXph ≥ 100, if both Γ and NH,i are well constrained, use Model C.
Otherwise, simply follow Rule 2.
The visual inspection process is performed by three people and a consensus is reached to
avoid discriminations and inconsistencies. The number of each model we finally choose
is shown in Table 4.2. For each model fit (A,B,C,D), we present an example as shown
in Figure 4.5.
Based on the spectral fitting results, we calculate a number of parameters includ-
ing the photon count rate, the observed flux between 0.3 and 10 keV, the unabsorbed
flux between 0.3 and 10 keV, and the hardness ratio. For objects with spectra, we
shift the data into the rest frame and calculate the monochromatic luminosity at 2 keV.
The numerical values of these physical quantities are tabulated in the final catalog (see
Section 4.4).
4.2.3 Weak X-ray Sources
We process weak X-ray sources (flagged as w in final catalog) with NXph < 10
separately because a fraction of these objects may not be detected by XRT and we can
only estimate their flux upper limits.
We first use confidlev (Kraft et al. 1991) to determine whether an X-ray source is
detected or not. There are three input parameters of this program: the total number of
photon counts in the source region NXph,tot,srcreg, the background photons counts in the
source region NXph,bkg,srcreg and a confidence level. We scale the background photons
from the background region NXph,bkg,bkgreg
NXph,bkg,srcreg = NXph,bkg,bkgreg
1
RT
1
RA
in which RT = Tbkgreg/Tsrcreg is the ratio of average exposure times in source and back-
ground regions and RA = Abkgreg/Asrcreg is the ratio of areas in source and background
regions. We use the 3σ as the criteria to judge if an X-ray source is detected so the
confidence level is 0.9973. Based on the results of confidlev, 98 out of 406 weak X-ray
sources are detected by XRT.
101
The X-ray flux values of detected X-ray sources are calculated using Model A
as bright X-ray source and PSF correction is automatically performed by Xspec using
the ARF file. For undetected sources, we use flux scaling and interpolation methods
to obtain the PSF-corrected flux upper limits. For undetected sources with none-zero
photons received, we can still use Xspec to calculate the PSF corrected flux between 0.3
and 10 keV FPSF,Xspec
2, the flux upper limit can be scaled from photon counts so that
FPSF,Xspec,lim = FPSF,Xspec
NXph,lim
NXph
in which NXph,lim is the source photon count upper limit output by confidlev.
If an X-ray source has zero photon counts received or if the received photon count
is small (e.g., NXph < 2), Xspec is unable to build a model to fit input data. In these
cases, we first calculate the flux without PSF correction using pimms (Mukai 1993) and
then obtain the PSF-corrected flux using interpolation. The pimms software allows us
to calculate the absorbed and unabsorbed flux between 0.3 and 10 keV without PSF
correction, i.e., Fabs,noPSF and Fuabs,noPSF by specifying the count rate upper limits.
Note that for one object, the fraction before and after the PSF correction is constant,
regardless of absorbed or unabsorbed flux, i.e.,
Fabs,PSF
Fabs,noPSF
=
Funabs,PSF
Funabs,PSF
= const
Therefore, the only parameter we need to know if the PSF-corrected flux with absorption
Fabs,PSF. This can be obtained by by scaling the count rate limits based a detected
reference X-ray source, i.e.,
FPSF,int,lim = CRlim
F 0
PSF,Xspec
CR0
(4.2)
in which CR0 and F 0PSF,Xspec are the count rate and real flux with absorption of the
detected reference X-ray source, and CRlim is the count rate upper limit of the undetected
X-ray source. Because the PSF correction is dependent on the offset angle θ and photon
energy ǫ (Moretti et al. 2005), the reference object must be located at a similar offset
angle and have a similar spectral shape as the target source. In addition, the reference
object should be located at the same offset angle in all sky images so that the difference
of PSF correction across different images is negligible. To simplify the process to search
for these reference objects to match a particular target object, we use a more general
approach by generating a curve of F 0
PSF,Xspec
/CR0 as a function of offset angle θ based on
reference objects and interpolate this curve to obtain the corresponding FPSF,Xspec/CR
for undetected using Equation (4.2).
The reference object candidates are selected from two sets
1. X-ray sources flagged with g and a whose X-ray spectra are modeled using Model A
and Model B. For X-ray sources modeled with Model B, we only select sources
2The uncertainty is so large that it is consistent with zero.
102
whose photon indices are consistent with Γ = 2 within uncertainties. There are
263 candidates in this set.
2. Detected X-ray sources flagged with w. This set includes 98 sources.
For consistency, the selected reference objects must have the same source region aperture
(otherwise, the PSF corrections are different). Because a majority of sources has a source
region radius of 30′′ (Figure 4.2), X-ray sources whose source region apertures other than
this value are excluded. For each object, the offset angles of all sky images must be
consistent within δθ < 0.1′. Using these two criteria, the final set of reference objects
contains 153 objects. Their offset angle distribution is presented in Figure 4.3.
In Figure 4.4, we plot the F/CR vs. θ for all of reference objects. The dispersion
is due to other factors that control the PSF correction, e.g., photon energy distribution.
Because we wish to perform a mean interpolation for these extremely X-ray faint sources
by neglecting other factors, we bin the data points in Figure 4.4 with bin size of 1′. The
red boxes in Figure 4.4 represent the curve after binning, and the curve is tabulated in
Table 4.3.
For undetected X-ray sources whose NXph < 2 and source region apertures are not
30′′, their flux limits are estimated by re-extracting events and X-ray spectra with source
region radius equal to 30′′. If the original source region radius is smaller than 30′′, this
may reduce the S/N of the source, but will still provide an order of magnitude estimate
of flux upper limit. After calculating the PSF-corrected unabsorbed flux between 0.3
and 10 keV, we can easily calculate the rest-frame flux limit at 2 keV and convert it to
monochromatic luminosity limit at 2 keV.
4.2.4 UVOT Data
Instead of using a pipeline to obtain a co-added event file as was done with the
XRT data, we process each individual UVOT sky image for each object. The composite
photometry can then be obtained by summing over photon counts from each individual
image and dividing it by the total exposure time.
First, we must identify defective sky images. Because we are using serendipitous
observations, it is inevitable that some sources are too close to the edge of the FOV3.
The goal of this process is to select a set of sky images so that the default source and
background regions can be directly applied on them.
The source region is defined using a circle with a radius of 3.′′0, which is recom-
mended in the UVOT photometric calibration (Poole et al. 2008). Since a 5.′′0 radius
aperture, which contains 85.8±3.8% of the PSF, was used for calibrating the UVOT, an
aperture correction is applied to the data when running uvotsource (Poole et al. 2008).
The inner and outer radii of the background region are r = 27.′′5 and R = 35.′′0 respec-
tively. This is the standard background region used to construct the first GRB afterglow
catalog (Roming et al. 2009). The large difference between the source and background
3Objects are not necessarily always within the FOV because our matching radius is larger
than UVOT FOV and/or because UVOT was working under other modes.
103
radii ensures that the background is at least 50 times as large as the source region to
provide an accurate background subtraction.
We then flag each sky image based on the position of the object and the aspect
keyword value. We only use the images whose aspect values equal to DIRECT. The
other images (flagged as −1) may not have correct aspect corrections and may lead to
inaccurate photometric results. The detailed image flagging strategy is tabulated in
Table 4.4 and depicted in Figure 4.6. First, if the object is out of the FOV, images are
flagged as −1 or 5 and discarded. In addition, the object cannot be too close to the edge
because of vignetting effects (flagged as 100+) or photon losses (flagged as 4) due to the
PSF. The minimum distance to the edge is dE = r = 27.
′′5 and the minimum distance to
the corner is dV = 100
′′. If r < dE < R = 35.
′′0 (flagged as 10+), we may need to shift
the background region slightly, so these images are passed to visual inspection process.
We accept images with dE > R.
Due to relatively small photon counts or positioning uncertainties, a fraction of
object images are not symmetric or well aligned with the default source region circle
with a radius of 3.′′0. It is necessary to co-align the quasar image with the center of
the source region circle because the aperture correction process assumes a symmetric
photon loss outside the pre-defined aperture. To co-align the locations, we extract a
region of 11× 11 pixels (about 5′′ × 5′′) centered on the SDSS quasar coordinates. If the
total photon count inside this region is less than 20, we regard this image as “faint” and
assign a flag of “1”. Even if a single image is regarded as “faint”, it will contribute when
stacked with other images of the source (e.g., Lehmer et al. 2007). If an image is not
flagged as “faint”, we attempt to fit the source with a two-dimensional Gaussian profile.
The background is determined by averaging the photons inside the region centered at
the SDSS coordinate and bounded by two squares with sides of 21×21 pixels and 11×11
pixels. If the photon count inside the 11× 11 pixel region is less than three times of the
background level, this image is also treated as “faint” (flagged as “1”). Otherwise, we
fit the 11 × 11 pixel region with a 2-D Gaussian profile initially centered at the SDSS
quasar coordinate. The new Gaussian centroid is then compared with the original SDSS
quasar coordinate. We denote their separation as δ (see Figure 4.6).
There are three categories of images.
• If δ ≤ 0.′′618, the two coordinates are regarded as consistent and the default source
region circle is used. This image is flagged as “0” and is passed to the next step.
• If 0.′′618 < δ ≤ 3.′′0, this image is flagged as “2” and the source region circle is
centered at the Gaussian centroid.
• If δ > 3.′′, this image is flagged as “3”. This large offset could be caused by
the unrecorded aspect problem, which requires manual correction or non-Gaussian
photon distribution. Less than 1% sky images are flagged as “3”, so we drop these
images from our analysis.
In the next step, we carefully define the default source and background regions
for each object. For each object, we select the sky image with the longest passband
central wavelength and the longest exposure. We preferentially use V band, because
(at least for local AGNs), stellar emission (and therefore the host galaxy contribution)
104
is larger in optical than in UV. If the V band is not available or its exposure is too
short (. 100 seconds), we examine the B band. If B is unavailable, we check U band,
and then UVW1, UVM2 and UVW2. For each object, we attempt to exclude all stars,
galaxies and bad pixels in the background annulus. If the source region is significantly
contaminated or most of the background region must be masked, we remove this object
from the UVOT analysis.
The procedures above can be performed automatically, but occasionally one must
manually adjust the results. For example, we found a number of images with stellar
ghost rings. Because we only use sky images of one waveband with the longest exposure,
these images may not be viewed and excluded in the region define process. This implies
that we must inspect all sky images to completely exclude images with nearby stars,
stellar ghost rings, galaxy spiral arms, comets, and bad pixels. Due to the difference of
aspect and exposure time, the influence of these factors may vary for each sky image
even for a given object. In addition, although the ASPCORR keyword is set to DIRECT, the
image may still suffer from uncorrected aspect problems so that a single point source may
have multiple images or even smeared images. Consequently, it is necessary to visually
inspect each sky image (> 26, 000 unique images) to perform the second order region
customization and image selection. After the visual inspection process, 3183 (1%) UVOT
sky images were excluded from our UVOT image set (Table 4.5). Figure 4.7 shows some
examples of removed sky images.
Our goal is to construct a catalog that contains the deepest sky image in each filter
for each object, but we are also interested in obtaining the time-resolved photometry.
Therefore, we use uvotsource 4 (HEADAS Version 6.10) to calculate photometry on
individual sky images using the curves of growth from the Swift CALDB5 for the aperture
correction model. The composite photometry is calculated using the photon counts of
all available images. For a given waveband, the mean magnitude is calculated as
〈m〉 = Zpt − 2.5 log 〈RLSS〉 (4.3)
In Equation 4.3, the Zpt is the zero-point magnitude (the magnitude when the count rate
is 1 photon s−1). The values are taken from Table 6 of Poole et al. (2008). RLSS is the
source count rate with coincidence-loss corrections, aperture corrections and large-scale
sensitivity corrections applied. The associated uncertainty in this magnitude measure-
ment is

Ti is the exposure time in image i. We also calculate the flux density at the effective
wavelength for each filter for each object by multiplying the LSS photon count rate by
the conversion factors in Table 10 (conversion from power-law spectra) of Poole et al.
(2008).
The above equations can be applied to an individual sky image as well as a group
of sky images. This process produces three measurements for each filter: photometry
for each individual sky image, for all sky images in an OBSID, and for all OBSIDs of
a filter. This information allows the construction of the light curve for each object at
each available waveband. An example of the UVOT data for a quasar is displayed in
Figure 4.9.
A total of 675 objects in our sample are detected by UVOT. We also calculate
flux upper limits for objects covered by UVOT but without detection. In this work, we
only use the UVOT-detected objects.
4.3 Quasar SEDs
We classify objects in the database into four types (Table 4.6) based on data
availability. In the description below, “useful data” includes both detections and non-
detections.
• Type A: The 637 objects that have useful data from both UVOT and XRT. We
will construct SEDs for this set of objects. These objects do not necessarily have
detections in all bands. Among these objects, 345 have detections by UVOT and
XRT; they will be the focus of our analysis.
• Type B: the 38 objects in this type only have useful data from UVOT but not
XRT; we will not create full band SED plots for objects in this type but we will
construct the SED in UV/optical band.
• Type C: The reverse of Type B, objects that have only useful data from XRT but
not UVOT. We will only create the XRT energy spectrum for these objects. There
are 168 objects this type.
• Type D: The 191 objects objects are bereft of any useful data from UVOT or XRT.
They are not included in the final catalog.
4.3.1 Supplementary Data
As the object redshift increases, more UVOT wavebands are shifted into EUV
band shortward of Lyα; as a consequence, they cannot be used to measure the rest-
frame UV power-law. The SDSS and 2MASS data, observed at longer wavelengths, can
be used to extend the available measurements to UV and optical bands in the quasars’
rest-frames. We supplement our UV photometry with the five bands (ugriz ) from SDSS
DR7 quasar catalog and three bands (J, H, Ks) of 2MASS (Cohen et al. 2003; Skrutskie
et al. 2006) survey, when available. In the best cases, we have 14 photometric data points
in UV/Optical wavebands: six from Swift/UVOT, five from SDSS, and 3 from 2MASS
(Table 4.7).
106
4.3.2 Initial SED Plots
The monochromatic luminosity corresponding to each UVOT filter can be easily
computed after shifting the flux density to the quasar’s rest-frame. The frequency band
widths are calculated from rest-frame FWHMs of corresponding wavebands (Table 4.7).
The quasar catalog provides magnitudes that we must convert to flux densities.
Instead of the asinh magnitude used in the general SDSS photometric measurements
(Lupton et al. 1999), we convert the SDSS flux densities from corresponding band mag-
nitude using the Pogson magnitude (Pogson 1857) which has a much simpler analyti-
cal expression m1 = −2.5 log f1/f0, where f0 is the zero-magnitude flux. The Pogson
magnitude system deviates from the asinh system for faint objects. According to asinh
softening parameters (b coefficients) table in the SDSS DR5 photometric calibration doc-
ument6), the difference between Pogson and asinh magnitudes is less than 1% for objects
brighter than g = 22.60 and u = 22.12. In Figure 4.8, we plot the apparent magnitudes
vs. redshift of all UVOT detected objects for all six UVOT filters. In Panel (b) and (c),
we plot the magnitude limits of SDSS u and g bands as dash-dotted lines, which indicates
that the majority of our objects are much brighter than limit. so the difference in Pogson
and asinh systems is negligible. There is one object (SDSSJ122740.85+440604.7) whose
B band magnitude is fainter than 22.60 and two objects (SDSSJ020316.37−074832.1,
and SDSSJ133613.62+025703.8) whose U band magnitudes are fainter than 22.12. They
are all at high redshift (z > 2.5) with extremely low X-ray photon counts (NXph < 10),
so they are not included in 345 quasars of the main sample. For each waveband in
SDSS, we adopt the central wavelength and FWHM from Fukugita et al. (1996). For
each waveband in 2MASS, we adopt the isophotal central wavelengths and bandwidths
from Cohen et al. (2003).
For X-ray sources with less than 100 photon counts, we use a different binning
strategy in XSPEC from the one presented in Table 4.1 to avoid large error bars. We
use the binning command setplot rebin to re-bin the spectrum until each bin has
a detection at least as large as 1 σ and no more than 100 bins maybe so combined.
Error types are set to quad which sums in quadrature the errors on the original bins.
The rebin command only affects the plot appearance but not the fitting results (see
Figure 4.5 for examples), but produces a clear representation of the average flux levels
and associated uncertainties. Because the relatively large uncertainties in the X-ray
energy spectrum, we calculate the lower and upper error bars of each flux point, instead
of applying standard error propagation.
The initial quasar SEDs are generated based on all available UV/optical photo-
metric data points and X-ray energy spectra. Before shifting into the rest-frame, we
perform Galactic reddening correction to all available wave band flux densities using
the standard E(B − V ) dependent extinction curve of Fitzpatrick (1999). Values of
E(B − V ) are calculated following Schlegel et al. (1998). An example of an SED is
shown in Figure 4.11.
These initial SEDs cannot be used to perform SED fitting due to two main reasons.

• Broad emission lines can contribute significantly to broad band filter measurements,
which may lead to incorrect SED shapes. For example, a UV band covering Lyα
can alter the UV slope up to a value of 0.2.
• The dates of the observation from SDSS, 2MASS, and Swift for a given object
differ, often by several years in the rest-frame. The data may need to be shifted to
mitigate the effect of variability.
4.3.3 Emission Line Correction
Emission line corrections have been performed by subtracting the broad line con-
tribution based on their average equivalent width (EW) (e.g., Elvis 2011, in preparation).
Because we have SDSS UV/optical spectra for all quasars, we use a more sophisticated
method that convolves the response function R(λ) of each filter with the observed spec-
trum ftot(λ) and the power-law only spectrum fpl(λ) to calculate the emission line cor-
rection factor.
EC = log
Ftot
Fpl
= log
∫
ftot(λ)R(λ)dλ − log
∫
fpl(λ)R(λ)dλ (4.6)
Because the quasar UV power-law usually extends from Lyα to ∼ 5600 Å (e.g., Vanden
Berk et al. 2001), we only need to perform emission corrections to filters covered within
this wavelength range. However, low-redshift quasar spectra do not cover Lyα and high-
redshift quasar spectra do not cover 5600 Å. In these cases, the emission line corrections
are performed based on the composite spectrum in Vanden Berk et al. (2001). Although
the shape of the composite spectrum may not be exactly the same as the real spectrum,
it does provide a mean correction.
To estimate the size of the errors introduced by performing emission line cor-
rections using the composite spectra, we study the emission line correction trends as a
function of redshift for different filters (see Figure 4.12). From these plots it is clear
that the emission line correction is typically less than 0.1 dex. The real spectrum cor-
rections are generally distributed around the composite spectrum, meaning they are
generally in agreement. To view their differences more clearly, we plots the distributions
of differences between these to correction, ∆EC = ECreal − ECcomposite, in Figure 4.13.
These distributions indicate that on average, the composite spectrum emission line cor-
rection is consistent with the real spectrum emission line correction; the dispersion of
these distributions are around 0.05. Therefore, we apply a systematic uncertainty of
0.05 to photometric points corrected using composite spectra. Figure 4.15 displays some
examples of emission corrections for quasars at different redshifts. After emission line
correction, the photometric slopes agree well with spectroscopic slopes in UV band with
a median value of −0.43. In the upper panel of Figure 4.14, we plot these two slopes for
objects with SED fitting. Most data points are distributed along the line representing
αν,ph = αν,sp with some scatter. We argue that this scatter is mostly caused by low
redshift quasars (typically z < 0.8) in which the 2200 Å “line-free” rest-frame contin-
uum point is not covered by SDSS spectra. In these cases, the uncertainty of the UV
spectroscopic slope αν,sp may be larger than for high redshift quasar spectra. The value
108
of αν,sp can be more accurately measured for objects at higher redshifts, which explains
why the dispersion of αν,ph − αν,sp is much smaller (bottom panel, Figure 4.14).
4.3.4 Photometric Shift
The unique feature of our dataset is the simultaneous observations in UV and X-
ray bands. Because of quasar variability, photometric observations in different dates may
have different flux levels. The photometric data in SDSS and 2MASS are not observed
in the same dates as the Swift UVOT. To make best use of these data, we perform some
pseudo-simultaneous data points by shifting the observed flux levels to be consistent
with the Swift UVOT photometry, assuming the UV/optical and IR SED shapes remain
unchanged. With additional data points, we can make better constraints to UV slopes
and luminosities while still approximately maintaining the simultaneous property of the
dataset. The photometric shift follows strategies described below (see Table 4.8 and
Figure 4.16).
• Because all quasars have five SDSS measurements we always interpolate or extrap-
olate the ugriz data to obtain fluxes at the UVOT filter effective wavelengths, then
shift all SDSS and 2MASS photometry to match UVOT.
• We prefer to match in the UVOT U band. The Swift U band is very close to
SDSS u band, which significantly reduces uncertainties introduced by interpola-
tion/extrapolation. The U band, being bluer than the V and B bands, is less
contaminated by host galaxy light.
• If Swift U band photometry is not available, we interpolate the SDSS u and g bands
to match the Swift B band. If neither U nor B band is available, we interpolate
the SDSS r and g band to match the Swift V band.
• If none of U, B, and V bands are available, we extrapolate the SDSS g and u band
to match one of UVW1, UVM2 and UVW2 bands, using the available UVOT
filter with the longer effective wavelength. Matching these filters is only done as a
last resort; the significant extrapolation required inevitably introduces considerable
photometric uncertainties. Further more, these three bands frequently lie in the
Lyman forest where the quasar SED suffers from severe intrinsic and intervening
absorption (e.g., Rauch 1998). This part of the continuum cannot be approximated
as a single power-law.
• When selecting filters, we require both of the SDSS filters and the UVOT filter to
fall in the UV range (between Lyα and 5600 Å) or within the EUV range, simply
because the UV power-law cannot be extended to EUV region.
Examples of photometric shifting results are presented in Figure 4.17.
109
4.3.5 Error Analyses
For UVOT photometry, we adopt the photometric uncertainties produced by uvot-
source and perform error propagation assuming these errors follow a Gaussian distribu-
tion. The error bars of SDSS and 2MASS fluxes are converted from magnitude uncer-
tainties in SDSS DR7 quasar catalog. The frequency bandwidth plotted on the SED are
converted from the corresponding FWHM of each filter.
For the XRT data, we use the parameter uncertainties produced by the error
command. Because the X-ray photon counts follow Poisson distribution, we must calcu-
late the upper and lower error bars separately.
4.3.6 SED Models
Because of the unavailability of the EUV data, which covers the BBB, the exact
bolometric luminosities strongly depends on the model used to fit the SED. Traditionally,
emission in this “gap” is represented by assuming a power-law continuum with a slope
αox. In this work, we consider a model which provides an upper limit of BBB in the
canonical case. This shape is inspired from the presence of a soft X-ray excess over a
flat X-ray component reported by Arnaud et al. (1985) in EXOSAT spectra of Seyfert 1
galaxy Mkn 841 and further observed and studied by Walter & Fink (1993) and Gierliński
& Done (2004). Specifically, the latter study found that this soft X-ray excess can be
well fit by a black body of energy 0.1 – 0.2 keV. This result motivates us to constrain
this feature using a “bump” shape. In the following context, we call the first model the
exponential decay model (hereafter EXP model). In addition, we use another SED model
by connecting the high energy limit of the UV power-law at Lyα and the lower energy
limit of the X-ray power-law at 0.3 keV. We call it the triple power-law model (hereafter
TPL model) (Grupe et al. 2010). In either model, the total flux is contributed by a UV
and an X-ray component.
fν,tot = fν,UV + fν,X. (4.7)
• EXP model. The two components are
fν,UV = 10
βUVναUVe(−hν/kTB)
γUV
(4.8)
fν,X = 10
βXναXe(−hν/kTX)
γX
(4.9)
The UV component is a power-law multiplied by an exponential decay term. The
power-law slope αUV and scale factor βUV are obtained by fitting photometric data
points covered in the UV region (from 5600 Å to Lyα). Canonically αUV ≈ −0.4
(e.g., Vanden Berk et al. 2001). The exponential term and the power-law term
create a “bump” in the EUV region. The value of γUV controls how fast the flux
declines given a value of TB which is obtained from SED fitting. We choose to fix
γUV = 1.5 so that at ν < ν(Lyα) the contribution from the exponential term is
negligible and the total curve agrees well with the UV power-law given the best fit
of TB. For example, if we adopt γUV = 1 Grupe et al. (2010), a typical value of
TB ∼ 4 Ryd as a result of the SED fitting produces a discrepancy between the UV
power-law and the total SED curve by ∼ 0.1 dex at ν(Lyα).
110
The X-ray component is also a power-law multiplied by an exponential decay term.
The power-law slope αX and scale factor βX are obtained by fitting the X-ray energy
spectra using XSPEC. The X-ray decay energy TX is fixed at 0.3 keV. We use the
same value of γX = −8/3 which assumes neutral hydrogen absorption (Longair
1992).
We emphasize that both of the UV and X-ray components are only mathemati-
cal expressions. For example, the value of TB does not reflect the accretion disk
temperature. Our goal is to place a reasonable upper limit to the BBB which
contributes a significant fraction of the bolometric luminosity (e.g., Mathews &
Ferland 1987; Zheng et al. 1997; Laor et al. 1997; Telfer et al. 2002; Shang et al.
2005). Therefore, the specific mathematical form is not important.
Because the XRT observes between 0.3 and 10 keV, these measurements are shifted
to higher energy range for high redshift quasars, i.e., we lack the soft X-ray data
points for these objects. This affects our SED fitting because if we only fit the
observed data points, the decay energy of the bump will be shifted to higher energy
band as the redshift becomes higher, which leads to additional flux contribution.
To solve this problem, we supplement some artificial data points by extending the
X-ray power-law from the minimum energy of the real data down to 0.3 keV. We
use 0.3 keV as the lowest energy for the X-ray power-law based on previous X-
ray studies of quasars. These investigations found that the X-ray power-law can
extend from ∼ 0.1 keV to & 10 keV (e.g., Turner & Pounds 1989; Laor et al. 1997;
George et al. 2000; Page et al. 2005; Young et al. 2009). A “soft X-ray excess”
below ∼ 0.3 keV is found in the X-ray spectra of AGNs and quasars (e.g., Walter &
Fink 1993; Crummy et al. 2006; Gierliński & Done 2004). We then fit all the data
points with this SED model using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, leaving TB
the only free parameter. The median value of TB is 5.96 Ryd.
• TPL model. In this model, the UV and X-ray power-laws are fit in the same way
as the EXP model. However, instead of multiplying an exponential decay term to
each power-law, we simply connect the UV power-law at Lyα and X-ray power-law
at 0.3 keV and define the slope as αUVX. The distribution of αUVX is presented in
Figure 4.18.
In a canonical situation, e.g., αUV = −0.4 and Γ = 2, the EXP model produces a bump
in the EUV region which produces an upper limit of the bolometric luminosity while
the TPL model yields a lower-limit of the BBB. This may not be the case for strong
X-ray absorption quasars. An example is shown in Panel (a) of Figure 4.19. In these
cases, the absorption leads to a flat UV slope in addition to low X-ray emission in soft
X-ray band. In these cases, the EXP model does not produce a “bump” but a “dip” in
the EUV region and the corresponding integrated bolometric luminosity is not reliable.
These quasars are flagged as “red” and will not be included into our cleaned sample
defined below. Some examples of fitted SEDs using these two models are presented in
Figure 4.19.
111
4.3.7 Bolometric Luminosity and Black Hole Mass
To obtain black hole masses, we must measure broad emission line widths which
can be done with the SDSS spectra. We employ the same software package we used
in previous SDSS spectral analyses (e.g., Wu et al. 2009; Vanden Berk et al. 2011,
in preparation). We remove bad pixels based on the flags from the SDSS pipeline and
perform Galactic reddening corrections to all the spectra using the E(B −V ) dependent
extinction curve of Fitzpatrick (1999). Values of E(B − V ) are calculated following
Schlegel et al. (1998). Each spectrum is shifted to the quasar’s rest-frame. We first
estimate the power-law continuum by connecting two empirical line-free regions. Next,
we perform the joint fit to the underlining continuum using a single power-law in the
UV band (between the Lyα emission line and ∼ 5500 Å), the small blue bump (between
∼ 2000 and ∼ 4000 Å), and the iron emission forest. We apply the UV iron template
from Vestergaard & Wilkes (2001) and the optical iron template from Véron-Cetty et al.
(2004). After we subtracting the underlying continuum, each broad emission line is fit by
a single or multiple Gaussian profiles. Because one of the goals of this step is to compare
the spectral fitting results using our soft package with those using the spectral fitting
pipeline in Shen et al. (2008b), we do not limit the fitting spectra for 346 quasars with
SEDs. Instead, we select 923 quasars from the raw catalog which contains 1034 quasars.
The other quasar spectra are not fit for several reasons: (1) they are identified as BAL
quasars; (2) their spectra have low S/N ; (3) their spectra are almost featureless (e.g., a
BL Lac object); (4) the emission lines are extremely broad (e.g., double peaked Hβ).
Because of the SDSS spectra have a fixed observed wavelength region, the redshift
range of the quasars in our sample does not allow us to select a set of features that are
defected in all of our quasars. As a result, we need to use different black hole mass
estimators at different redshifts. We adopt these black hole estimators from Shen et al.
(2008b). Basically, at z < 0.7, we use Hβ plus lλ(5100 Å), at 0.7 < z < 1.9, we use Mg ii
plus lλ(3000 Å), and at z > 1.9, we use C iv plus lλ(1350 Å). The black hole mass is
calculated using the following equation (Shemmer et al. 2006a; Shen et al. 2008b)
log
(
MBH
M⊙
)
= a + b log
(
λLλ
1044 ergs s−1
)
+ 2 log
(
FWHM
km s−1
)
(4.10)
in which (a, b) = (0.66, 0.53) for quasars with z < 0.7, (a, b) = (0.505, 0.62) for quasars
with 0.7 < z < 1.9 and (a, b) = (0.672, 0.61) for quasars with z > 1.9. The emission lines,
continuum points and (a, b) values for different redshifts and their original references are
tabulated in Table 4.9.
The bolometric luminosity is calculated using BC factors at 5100 Å for Hβ, 3000 Å
for Mg ii, and 1350 Å for C iv using the composite SED for a sample of SDSS-DR3
quasars constructed by Richards et al. (2006), so that Lbol,SDSS = BC · λlλ. The BC
values are tabulated in Table 4.9.
As a check on our results, we compare our important correlations and distributions
with Shen et al. (2008b). We first plot the black hole masses and bolometric luminosities
of 923 quasars (Figure 4.20). The locations of quasars are consistent with the locations
of quasars in Fig. 11 in Shen et al. (2008b), indicating that most quasars are accreting
in a sub-Eddington level. The few quasars fall below REdd = 1 limit (they are accreting
112
in super-Eddington level) are narrow line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies (Shen et al. 2008a;
Grupe et al. 2010). Figure 4.21 shows the black hole mass as a function of redshift. This
plot is consistent with Fig. 10 in Shen et al. (2008b). Finally, in Figure 4.25, we present
the distributions of FWHM for the three emission lines that are crucial parameters for
black hole mass estimation. The median values of log FWHM/(km s−1) are 3.62, 3.63
and 3.75 for Hβ, Mg ii and C iv, respectively. The distributions and median values
are again consistent with the results in Shen et al. (2008b). One can clearly see a
potential source of bias in the calculation of black hole masses as the C iv FWHMs are
systematically larger than those of Hβ and Mg ii. However, we still use the black hole
masses estimated by C iv because this offset is small compared to the dispersion of the
black hole mass distribution (see Figure 4.21).
The black hole masses are calculated using the emission line FWHMs and in-
terpolated continuum luminosities at corresponding wavelengths from fitting the UV
photometry. Their values are tabulated in the final catalog. In Figure 4.22, we com-
pare the black hole masses calculated using two different estimators. It is clear that the
black hole masses estimated from Mg ii and Hβ are consistent, but the C iv estimator,
produces a black hole mass typically 0.2 dex higher.
The bolometric luminosities are calculated by integrating our two model curves
from 5600 Å to 20 keV. In general, emission in this region contributes the majority of the
quasar luminosity unless the quasar shows strong excess emission in the infrared band
(Richards et al. 2006).
In Figure 4.26, we show the differences between the bolometric luminosities by
integrating two SED models and the bolometric luminosities calculated using BC. The
EXP model and the TPL model produce Lbol on average higher and lower than the
Lbol from BC, respectively. Because the bump emission from the EXP model is more
sensitive to the UV and X-ray observed spectral shapes than the TPL model, the EXP
model has a larger dispersion. A fraction of the EXP models produce less bolometric
luminosity (log Lbol,EXP− log Lbol,SDSS < 0) than the TPL models, a fraction of these ob-
jects are quasars with strong intrinsic absorption (the black shaded area in Figure 4.26).
The reason why the TPL model produces less bolometric luminosity on average than
the BC method is because the bolometric correction by Richards et al. (2006) includes
the infrared wavebands, which contributes about 37% of the total flux. After correcting
contribution from this component, the entire histograms of either EXP and TPL model
should move positively by ∼ 0.2 dex. Consequentially, the TPL model on average pro-
duces a bolometric luminosity consistent with that from the BC and the EXP model on
average over produces Lbol by ∼ 0.3 dex.
4.4 Catalog Description
Our results are tabulated in a catalog, available in the online edition, which
contains 843 quasars with 0.0129 ≤ z ≤ 4.5766 and −30.24 . Mi . −22.01. There are
805 objects covered by UVOT, 675 covered by XRT and 637 covered by both UVOT
and XRT observations. The X-ray detection rate is 399/675 =∼ 59%. Among these
objects, 345 objects have both detections in UVOT and XRT, so that we are able to
plot their SEDs from UV to X-ray band. These objects constitute our parent sample to
113
evaluate the flux contribution from the BBB in the next chapter. This catalog contains
parameters directly measured from UVOT and XRT and quantities derived based on
these measurements such as the black hole mass and bolometric luminosity. Each column
in this catalog is described in Table 4.10.
4.4.1 Comments on Individual Objects
The following sources possess special spectroscopic or photometric features or
have unusual classifications.
• SDSSJ102738.53+605016.5. The optical spectrum of this object exhibits extremely
broad and double-peaked Hβ, and is cataloged as a double-peaked emission line
quasar in Wu & Liu (2004). They derived the FWHM of Hβ of ∼ 16, 200 km s−1
and black hole mass of log (MBH/M⊙) = 9.649.
• SDSSJ141927.49+044513.8. This object has a featureless UV spectrum with a few
narrow absorption lines. It is a BL Lac object in the catalogs of Collinge et al.
(2005), Plotkin et al. (2008) and Massaro et al. (2009). The narrow absorption
lines are most likely to be intervening.
• SDSSJ090821.01+045059.4. The Mg ii λ2798 emission line is barely detected,
Hβ is extremely weak and the two nearby [O iii] lines appear very prominent,
indicating that the BLR is obscured and only the NLR is seen. This object has
been identified as a strong radio source (e.g., Griffith et al. 1995) but the exact
classification is not determined, yet.
• SDSSJ161742.53+322234.3. This is the strong ratio quasar 3C 332. The Hβ
line is relatively weak, but the Hα line exhibits a very prominent double peak
structure with a FWHM of 19600 km s−1 measured by Strateva et al. (2006)
and 23200 km s−1 measured by Wu & Liu (2004). The black hole mass is large,
log (MBH/M⊙) = 9.334 (Wu & Liu 2004). The Hα line also displays long-term
profile variability which can be explained by a low, smooth, secular change in disk
illumination (Gezari et al. 2007).
• SDSSJ083148.87+042939.0. This is a FSRQ (a subtype of blazar, see Section 1.1)
with peak radio flux of ∼ 1 Jy. The optical spectrum exhibit a featureless contin-
uum with an extremely weak Hα emission line.
• SDSSJ021702.66−082052.3. This is another FSRQ as cataloged in Massaro et al.
(2009). The optical spectrum exhibits a featureless continuum with very weak
Mg ii and Hβ emission lines and a few narrow lines such as [O iii].
• SDSSJ074625.86+254902.1. This is a high redshift FSRQ (Massaro et al. 2009)
with z = 2.979 and an MeV blazar discovered by Swift (Tueller et al. 2008; Jolley
et al. 2009; Sambruna et al. 2006) and thus in the BAT selected AGN catalog by
Winter et al. (2009). It is also observed by Suzaku (Watanabe et al. 2009). The
UV spectrum contains broad emission lines such as Lyα, C iv and C iii] λ1908,
which is unusual for a blazar.
114
• SDSSJ154929.43+023701.1. This object is classified as a FSRQ (Healey et al.
2007) with high polarization (Scarpa & Falomo 1997). The optical spectrum from
SDSS, however, contains prominent Mg ii, Hβ, and even H γ lines. Even some
weak forbidden lines are prominent, e.g., the two [Ne v] lines around 3400 Å. This
is another case in which a blazar has a regular broad line quasar spectrum.
• SDSSJ121826.51+294846.5. This object, also known as Mkn 766 and NGC 4253,
is a local Seyfert 1.5 galaxy (z = 0.013) and is resolved in the UVOT image.
Because of the strong host galaxy contamination, it is difficult to isolate the AGN
component. It is not included in our UVOT processing list. The X-ray spectrum is
complicated; it cannot be fit by any model we prescribed in Table 4.2. This object
was previously studied in detail in the Swift AGN catalog by Grupe et al. (2010).
• SDSSJ162901.30+400759.9. This object is classified as a blazar in Massaro et al.
(2009) or FSRQ by Falcone et al. (2004) but also classified as a NLS1 galaxy by
Bade et al. (1995). The optical spectrum exhibits strong Hα, Hβ, and a complex
of low ionization Fe ii emission.
• SDSSJ083740.24+245423.1. This object is a blazar and classified as a FSRQ by
Healey et al. (2007). The UV spectrum exhibits strong Mg ii and C iii] λ1908
emission lines.
• SDSSJ101405.89+000620.3. This quasar is classified as a Seyfert 1.8 by Dong et al.
(2005). The optical spectrum exhibits a strong and double peaked Hα but weak
Hβ. The excess emission over the power-law around these two lines is likely to be
contributed by host galaxies.
• SDSSJ213638.58+004154.1. This z = 1.9414 FSRQ has a strong radio jet (Healey
et al. 2007; Liu & Zhang 2002; Massaro et al. 2009). The UV spectrum contains
strong Mg ii, C iv, and C iii] λ1908 emission lines.
• SDSSJ170231.06+324719.6. This is a typical NLS1 (Zhou et al. 2006b; Grupe
et al. 2010).
• SDSSJ135516.54+561244.7. This is a typical NLS1 (Zhou et al. 2006b; Grupe
et al. 2010).
• SDSSJ092703.01+390220.8. This is a FSRQ with strong radio jet (Healey et al.
2007; Liu & Zhang 2002). The UV / optical spectrum also contains prominent
Mg ii, Hβ and H γ emission lines.
• SDSSJ074110.70+311200.2. This is an FSRQ (Healey et al. 2007; Liu & Zhang

• SDSSJ094215.12+090015.8. This is quasar with double peaked Hα. The FWHM
of the broad component is extremely wide and reaches ∼ 40, 600 km s−1, which is
the broadest known (Wang et al. 2005). The extremely broad Hα suggests that
the emission region is close to the black hole r ∼ 80–100 rg (Strateva et al. 2006).
• SDSSJ142921.87+540611.2. This object was classified as an FSRQ by Healey et al.
(2007), and Massaro et al. (2009), and listed as a lensed quasar candidate in King
et al. (1999). Browne et al. (2003) rejected the lensing hypothesis based upon
surface brightness and spectral indices criteria.
• SDSSJ081331.28+254503.0. This is a confirmed lensed quasar (Williams et al.
2008; Congdon et al. 2010; Inada et al. 2010); it is excluded from our analyses
because the amplified fluxes.
• SDSSJ101541.14+594445.2. This is a RL quasar exhibiting two pairs of radio
lobes in an X-shape (Cheung 2007). The origin of the wings in these radio sources
is unclear.
4.5 Correlation Analyses
In this section, we investigate the αox-lν(2500 Å) relationship using a selected
sample of Type 1 quasars from our catalog. This correlation has been described in
a series of papers (Avni & Tananbaum 1982; Marshall et al. 1984; Tananbaum et al.
1986; Anderson & Margon 1987; Wilkes et al. 1994; Pickering et al. 1994; Avni et al.
1995; Vignali et al. 2003; Strateva et al. 2005; Steffen et al. 2006; Just et al. 2007); as
quasars become more luminous, their relative UV and X-ray SEDs become softer, i.e.,
less X-ray emission with respect to UV emission. In the study of 372 type 1 quasars in
Just et al. (2007; hereafter the J07 sample), the UV/optical data are from SDSS DR3
quasar catalog (Schneider et al. 2005), IUE (Boggess et al. 1978; Kondo et al. 1989) and
COMBO-17 survey (Wolf et al. 2003) which covers the E-CDF-S (Wolf et al. 2004). The
X-ray data are from ROSAT, Chandra, and XMM-Newton. As a result of this variety of
observations, the UV/optical and X-ray data for an object frequently span a time scale
of years. Quasar variability inevitably introduces scatters to αox–lν(2500 Å) relation.
In this section, we attempt to demonstrate that this scatter can be reduced by using
simultaneous observed UV and X-ray data.
4.5.1 Sample Selection
In this work, we use 637 quasars with simultaneous observations by both UVOT
and XRT. The sample size vs. exposure cut-off is presented in Figure 4.27 and the X-ray
detection rate vs. exposure cut-off is presented in Figure 4.28. It is seen from Figure 4.28
that the X-ray detection rate is very low if we use the entire parent sample. Even if we
supplement our dataset with that in Grupe et al. (2010), the detection rate is still less
than 70%, i.e., over 30% of X-ray flux values are censored data (upper limits). These
censored data can be handled by the ASURV software package but the large fraction
of non-detections makes the results unreliable. On the other hand, if we use a very
116
long exposure time, the detection rate rises to > 95%, but only a few objects remain in
the sample and the statistics are very poor. Therefore, the selection of X-ray exposure
time cut-off should balance the sample size as well as the X-ray detection rate. In this
thesis, we use 20,000 s as the XRT exposure cut-off. The sample size with this constraint
contains about 130 objects and the X-ray detection rate is increased to about 90%. We
define this sample the catalog parent sample. In the following analysis, we supplement
this sample with the AGNs in Grupe et al. (2010), which contains 88 Swift observed
AGNs7. We define this sample supplemental sample or the G10 sample. The parent
sample is mixed with different types of quasars. To obtain a cleaned catalog sample,
we exclude objects that fall into any of the following four categories. The number of
quasars in each category is tabulated in Table 4.11. The cleaned catalog sample contains
89 objects with an X-ray detection rate 90%. There are 22 objects from the G10 sample
after applying the 20 ks exposure cut-off. Because the G10 sample is X-ray selected, all
objects are detected by XRT.
• RL quasars. They frequently have substantial X-ray flux from the radio jet,
which leads to a higher αox than those of radio quiet quasars (Worrall et al. 1987;
Brinkmann et al. 2000).
We adopt the “radio loudness” (R∗) defined by the ratio of monochromatic lu-
minosities at rest-frame 5 GHz and 2500 Å (Stocke et al. 1992; della Ceca et al.
1994; Lu et al. 2007; Miller et al. 2009), e.g., R∗ = lν(5 GHz)/lν(2500 Å). This
definition differs slightly from the R criterion, which is defined using the observed
radio flux at 5 GHz and B band power (e.g., a Parkes radio quasar; Kellermann
1989). Because the former provides a more consistent estimate of the intrinsic
ratio of radio to optical power among quasars at different redshifts, we adopt R∗
throughout the paper.
For most of quasars in the parent sample, we calculate the k-corrected lν(5 GHz)
from the 20 cm peak flux from the Very Large Array (VLA) FIRST Survey (Becker
et al. 1995; White et al. 1997) cataloged in the SDSS DR7 quasar catalog. The
equation to convert a radio flux from the observed frequency ν to the k-corrected
frequency ν1 assuming a constant power-law index αr is
log fν1 = log fν + αr log
ν1
ν
− (1 + αr) log (1 + z). (4.11)
In our case, ν1 = 5 GHz, ν = 1.5 GHz (corresponding to 20 cm). Here, we assume
an average value of radio spectral index αr = −0.5 (e.g., Kellermann et al. 1989;
Komossa et al. 2006; Lu et al. 2007).
For objects not detected by the FIRST survey (but still covered), we estimate radio
luminosity upper limits using the sensitivity limit of the FIRST survey, which is
1 mJy, which provides upper limits of R∗. If log R∗ < 1, we classify this object as
RQ. If log R∗ ≥ 1, we cannot simply claim it as RL because R∗ is a lower limit. In
this situation, we to refer to other resources of radio surveys, such as NRAO VLA
Sky Survey (NVSS; Condon et al. 1998).
7There are 92 objects in total, but 4 objects were not observed by UVOT, so they are excluded.
117
For objects not covered by the FIRST survey, we first check the published literature
and see if this object was detected in previous radio observations. If no observation
is found, we examine 15′ NVSS image for strong nearby radio source. If we cannot
confirm the quasar as RQ, we conservatively exclude it from the cleaned sample.
We preferentially adopt lν(2500 Å) from SDSS spectral fitting results, unless 2500 Å
is not covered, in which situation we use lν(2500 Å) calculated from the SED fitting.
• Lensed quasar. The flux from these quasars are amplified, so these objects are re-
moved from the cleaned sample (e.g., Just et al. 2007) because of flux uncertainty.
There is only one confirmed lensed quasar in our sample: SDSSJ142921.87+540611.2
(see Section 4.4.1).
• Blazars, including BL Lac objects and FSRQs, usually have large amplitude varia-
tions in UV/optical (e.g., Rani et al. 2010) as well as strong radio and X-ray emis-
sions (e.g., Beckmann et al. 2003; Padovani et al. 2007). As a result, the values of
αox can vary significantly over time. The UV/optical spectrum of BL Lac objects
usually have a featureless continuum without any emission lines (e.g., Blandford &
Rees 1978; Kollgaard 1994; Plotkin et al. 2008; Abdo et al. 2010). Many of them
are RL and their emissions are believed to be relativistically beamed from the jet
(Urry & Padovani 1995). Although some FSRQs exhibit similar broad emission
line features as Type 1 quasars, their radio emission is still beamed and variable.
These objects are also excluded from the cleaned sample.
• Reddened quasars. Our sample contains a number of quasars with shallow UV/optical
slopes and/or strong soft X-ray decline (e.g., Figure 4.23). The relatively flat
UV/optical spectra are attributed to dust reddening (Richards 2001; Richards et al.
2003; Hopkins et al. 2004), although observations of individual objects suggest that
some slopes could be intrinsically steep (e.g., Hall et al. 2006). The standard red-
dening correction is to measure the Balmer decrement and to assume an intrinsic
Hα/Hβ value, e.g., 2.86 (Osterbrock & Ferland 1989; Peterson 1997). However,
this value assumes a low density region and optically thin emission lines (Baker &
Menzel 1938), which may be applicable to planetary nebulae but not quasar BLRs,
because the gas density of the latter is much higher and radiative transfer effects
are not the same as in low density regime (e.g., Hao et al. 2005). In this work, we
only flag these objects and exclude them from the cleaned sample.
Following Richards et al. (2003), we use the relative color to define the “dust-
reddened” quasars. The relative color is calculated by subtracting the median
colors of quasars at the redshift of each quasar from measured colors of each quasar.
As argued by Richards et al. (2003), the quantity ∆(g−i) = (g−i)−Median(g−i)z
is an excellent redshift-independent surrogate for the photometric spectral index.
In Figure 4.24, we plot ∆(g − i) vs. redshift for all the objects in our raw catalog.
Objects to the right of the dashed line are flagged as “dust-reddened” quasars.
These quasars, which comprise 8.5% of the raw catalog, are excluded from our
Cleaned sample.
118
4.5.2 The αox–lν(2500 Å) Relation
In this section, we compare the dispersions between the J07 sample and our
cleaned catalog sample. We show that the dispersion can be reduced using simultaneous
UV and X-ray observations. Because the exact values of dispersion could be method-
dependent, we use two methods in our analyses.
To enlarge our sample size, we supplement our cleaned catalog sample with the
sample in Grupe et al. (2010). The G10 sample also contains simultaneous observations
from Swift UVOT and XRT. The G10 sample is soft X-ray selected and is composed of
low redshift AGNs (z . 0.4). Therefore, these objects are mostly low luminosity AGNs
and thus complements to our cleaned sample, which are relatively intrinsically bright
Finally, the G10 sample primarily consists of Type 1 AGNs, with only a few exceptions.
After removing the overlap with our sample and two RL objects in G10, we construct a
combined sample which consists of 111 objects. We will present two sets of results based
on both of the cleaned catalog sample and the combined sample.
Because our sample contains censored data, we use ASURV software package
(Lavalley et al. 1992) to perform statistical analysis. This package include the Expectation-
Maximization (EM) and the Buckley-James (BJ) algorithms, which we can use to per-
form linear regression and dispersion estimation. The methods differ in that the EM
algorithm estimates the residual assuming a Gaussian distribution while the BJ algo-
rithm assumes the Kaplan-Meire distribution. The correlation and regression results are
tabulated in Table 4.12. The results indicate that
• The cleaned catalog and the combined sample both exhibit strong correlations
between αox and lν(2500 Å), although the absolute values of correlation coefficients
are a bit lower than the J07 sample.
• The slope of the cleaned sample (−0.1532±0.0125) is steeper than the J07 sample,
the intercept is also larger, but they are both consistent within 1 σ error bars.
The combined sample has a shallower slope than the cleaned catalog sample which
is caused by the G10 sample. The possibility that the αox–lν(2500 Å) relation is
non-linear is proposed in the study of Wilkes et al. (1994) and Anderson et al.
(2003). As discussed in Wilkes et al. (1994), the difference in slopes is likely
caused by the varying host galaxy contribution to the lν(2500 Å) measurement
at low redshift. This may be the reason for the G10 sample since host galaxy
contribution is not corrected8. Strateva et al. (2005) found that their sample does
not offer significant evidence for a non-linear αox–lν(2500 Å) relation. Although
they obtained a shallower slope of −0.09±0.02 for the low luminosity (lUV < 30.5)
and −0.13± 0.02 for the high luminosity (lUV > 30.5) sample, they argue that the
difference in slopes is likely an artifact of the addition of five outlier AGNs, which
are probably X-ray-absorbed Seyfert galaxies at z < 0.22. From Figure 4.29, we do
not see low luminosity “outliers”, but we still cannot exclude the possibility that
the shallower slope is caused by host galaxy contamination. In addition, we also
8We do not correct for host galaxy light in our sample, but since the majority of our objects
are luminous quasars at higher redshift than G10, the host galaxy contamination is much smaller.
119
note that the J10 sample contains a number of the most luminous quasars with
lUV > 31.5, but excluding these high luminosity quasars does not reduce the slope
significantly (see regression results of J07T 9 in Table 4.12). A careful removal
of host galaxy contribution is probably necessary for further check, e.g., by using
GalFit (Peng et al. 2002, 2010).
• From Table 4.12, it is clear that the standard deviation of the cleaned catalog
sample is smaller than the J07 sample by about 13%-19%. This is dispersion is
reduced by 18%–25% using the combined sample because the G10 sample has a
higher degree of simultaneity.
• The dispersion of the lν(2500 Å)-αox relation does not exhibit a luminosity depen-
dence (see Figure 7 of Just et al. 2007). From Figure 4.29, we do not see the
dispersion showing any evident dependence on luminosity, either.
4.6 Conclusions
We have compiled a serendipitous quasar catalog with simultaneous UV/optical
and X-ray observations by Swift. The catalog is generated by matching the ∼ 3.5 year
Swift pointings from November, 2004 to June, 2008 to the SDSS DR5 quasar catalog.
For each object, the sky images observed by either UVOT or XRT are carefully selected
to ensure image quality. In this work, we derive the composite UVOT photometry and
XRT energy spectra by stacking all archival data to generate the deepest sky images.
The resultant SEDs reflect the time-averaged shape of quasar emission with simultaneous
observations at multi-wavebands. The final catalog contains 843 objects (see Table 4.6).
There are 637 objects (∼ 76%) that have UVOT and XRT observations, 168 objects
(∼ 20%) that only have XRT data and 38 objects that only have UVOT data (∼ 4%).
Among all the 675 objects with X-ray coverage, 399 (∼ 59%) are detected. We construct
SED plots for all objects with both XRT and UVOT data. In this thesis, we focus on
637 objects with both X-ray and UV observations. We supplement UVOT photometry
with SDSS and 2MASS data if available. All the photometric points are corrected for
the effects of emission lines and those from SDSS and 2MASS shifted to match the flux
levels of Swift UVOT.
We fit SEDs using the EXP and TPL models, attempting to constrain the flux
contribution from the BBB. In most cases, the EXP models creates a bump in the EUV
region, producing an upper limit of the BBB emission, while the TPL model connects
the SED points at 1216 Å and 0.3 keV, producing a lower limit of the BBB emission.
After correcting the contribution from IR emission, the TPL model produces bolometric
luminosities consistent with those estimated from BC while the EXP model produces
bolometric luminosities on average 0.3 dex higher than the TPL model.
We further select a cleaned sample comprised of 89 typical RQ quasars. We also
supplement this cleaned sample with 22 nearby AGNs from Grupe et al. (2010). We
re-visit the αox–lν(2500 Å) relation presented by Just et al. (2007), which is the best
9Low luminosity sample log lν(2500 Å) ≤ 31 in J07.
120
sample so far to investigate this correlation. We use two methods to compare the intrinsic
scatters of the αox–lν(2500 Å) relationship of our and the J07 sample using EM and
James-Buckley methods. These two methods consistently indicate that the dispersion
based on our sample is reduced by 13% to 19% using the cleaned catalog sample and
18% to 25% usinig the combined sample. This is the first time the reduced scatter in
this relation has been seen. The reduction amount is on average smaller than expected
(σαOX = 0.15 as estimated by Strateva et al. 2005), but it can be potentially increased
by using observations spanning a relatively short period of time. Firmly establishing
the αox–lν(2500 Å) emission in AGNs is an important step toward understanding energy
generation mechanisms of AGNs. Our work further verified this correlation and validate
that this correlation is intrinsically even tighter by reducing or eliminating scatters result
from variabilities.

red. Black curves are synthesize SED using EXP model and dashed lines represent
TPL models. Dotted curves are UV and X-ray components for the EXP model. The
SDSSJ154929.43+023701.1 is a case with strong UV and X-ray absorptions, in which
the EXP model is no longer an upper limit of BBB emission.

Fig. 4.20 Black hole mass as a function of bolometric luminosity for 923 quasars in
our catalog. Quasars are color-coded based on their redshift ranges following the same
convention as Shen et al. (2008b): red for z < 0.7, green for 0.7 < z < 1.9, and blue for
z > 1.9. We also plot solid, dashed and dash-dot lines when the Eddington ratio is 1,
0.1 and 0.01.

Fig. 4.21 Black hole mass as a function of redshift for 923 objects in our catalog. The
black hole masses are measured based on quasar spectra in SDSS DR7 quasar catalog.
Quasars are color-coded based on their redshift ranges (and the emission lines and con-
tinuum points used for calculation). Low redshift (z < 0.7) are plot in red; intermediate
redshift (0.7 < z < 1.9) are plot in green; high redshift (z > 1.9) objects are plot in blue.

Upper: black hole masses of 53 quasars whose spectra cover both Mg ii and Hβ. Lower:
black hole masses of 83 quasars whose spectra cover both Mg ii and C iv. In either panel,
the dash-dotted line represents the equality of values from two different estimators.

Swift (black), SDSS (blue), and 2MASS (red). The band passes are listed below the
photometric data points, and the positions of important emission lines and continuum
wavelength/energy points are marked. The SDSS and 2MASS data points are not cor-
rected for emission lines and not shifted to match the Swift flux level. Galactic reddening
corrections have been applied to all UV/optical data points. The intrinsic column den-
sity NH,i ∼ 1022 cm−2, which is about two orders of magnitude higher than the Galactic
column.

with E(B − V ) = 0.04 (see Richards et al. (2003) for the choice of 0.04 as the value of
E(B − V )). The dash line is the dotted line shifted by 0.2 to match the dust-reddening
quasar definition of Richards et al. (2003). Quasars to the right of the dashed line can
be considered to be dust-reddened.

Fig. 4.25 Distributions of FWHM for Hβ, Mg ii, and C iv, for all objects in our raw
catalog whose SDSS spectra are fit using our software package. The Hβ emission line
is fit using three Gaussian profiles; Mg ii and C iv are fit using two Gaussian profiles.
The histograms indicate that while Hβ and Mg ii have similar median values, the peak
of C iv distribution is evidently higher, suggesting the bias of using C iv as a black hole
mass estimator.

Chapter 5
The Physical Conditions of the Intrinsic Nv
Narrow Absorption Line Systems of Three Quasars
5.1 Introduction
Intrinsic absorption lines seen in the spectra of quasars are thought to originate
in ionized gas physically related with the quasar “central engine” (e.g., Hamann et al.
2004). They include resonance lines that appear in the rest-frame UV band, such as
Nv, C iv and/or high ionization species that have absorption lines and edges in the
soft X-ray band, such as Ovii and Oviii (e.g., Reynolds 1997; Giustini et al. 2010).
The intrinsic UV absorption lines are usually blueshifted relative to the quasar emission
lines and they are believed to arise from gas that is outflowing from the immediate
vicinity of the central engine. Lines that are blueshifted by less than 5000 km s−1 are
conventionally regarded as associated absorption lines (AALs). Many of these may indeed
be connected to broad emission-line region (BELR) (Ganguly et al. 2001) and to X-ray
“warm” absorbers (Mathur et al. 1995; Brandt et al. 2000). These absorption lines thus
trace the physical conditions and kinematics surrounding the central engine over a wide
range of redshifts, and thus provide a diagnostic of quasar evolution.
Narrow intrinsic absorption lines (NALs) typically have widths . 500 km s−1 so
that their doublets can be separated at high spectral resolution (see Hamann & Sabra
2004). This is in contrast to broad absorption lines (BALs) whose width can reach
30,000 km s−1 (Trump et al. 2006). Intrinsic NALs studies are complementary to stud-
ies of BALs, since they probe different regions in the quasar surroundings. Although the
intrinsic NALs are more difficult to identify, several practical considerations make the
derivation of their physical conditions more straightforward than for BALs. (Hamann &
Ferland 1999). Because NALs are often unsaturated and resolved, we can measure di-
rectly the NAL coverage fractions and column densities of various ions. In BAL systems,
doublet transitions are often self–blended, making such measurement more difficult.
Approximately 60% of all quasars show evidence of outflows (Misawa et al. 2007;
Ganguly & Brotherton 2008). Although statistical methods can be used to determine
this, partial coverage of doublets and multiplets and time variability analysis are the
two most commonly used ways to determine decisively if a particular NAL system is
intrinsic. These signatures are only seen in low ionization transitions of intervening
absorbers, and only rarely in the case of small molecular clouds that could be smaller
than the projected size of the background quasar broad emission line region. (e.g., Jones
et al. 2010, Ivanchik et al. 2010). Partial coverage is described by the coverage fraction
Cf , which is the fraction of photons from the background source that pass through
the absorber (Barlow et al. 1997). It can be estimated using the residual flux ratio of
resonance doublets (e.g., Barlow & Sargent 1997; Ganguly et al. 1999). Variability of
163
the absorption lines could be caused by transverse motion of the absorbing material or
by changes in its ionization state (Hamann 1997; Misawa et al. 2005). Using UV spectra
of z 6 1.5 quasars observed at two different epochs separated by 4–10 years with the
Hubble Space Telescope, Wise et al. (2004) concluded that a minimum of 21% of the
AALs are variable. A similar conclusion was reached for z ∼ 2 quasars by Narayanan
et al. (2004).
Early work investigating metal abundances using narrow associated absorption
lines indicated supersolar metallicities, i.e., Z > Z⊙ (Petitjean et al. 1994; Tripp et al.
1996; Hamann 1997). More recent work measures metallicities consistent with the previ-
ously determined values, and in some cases, it has provided a more stringent constraint.
Papovich et al. (2000) analyzed a z = 1.207 AAL system towards Q0122+0388 with the
help of photoionization models and found Z ∼ 2Z⊙. Fields et al. (2005) found that the
metallicity must be at least 5Z⊙ in order to produce the high-ionization absorption lines
(Ovi, C iv, and Nv) of the narrow-line Seyfert galaxy Mrk 1044. Gabel et al. (2006)
also found supersolar abundances by modelling the AALs of the quasar J2233−606, with
[C/H], [O/H] ≈ 0.5–0.9, and [N/H] ≈ 1.1−1.3. High metallicity, up to 3Z⊙, is suggested
in the study of quasar PG 0935+417 (Hamann et al. 2004). A study of the outflow from
Mrk 279 by Arav et al. (2007) has found an overabundance carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen
relative to the Sun by factors of 2.2±0.7, 3.5±1.1, and 1.6±0.8, respectively. Moreover,
photoionization modeling of associated NALs systems find metallicities ranging between
a few and 20 times the Solar value (e.g., Petitjean et al. 1994, Tripp, Lu & Savage 1996,
D’Odorico et al. 2004) . Such high metal abundances are also inferred from analysis of
the broad emission lines. For example, Hamann et al. (2002) find that α-elements, such
as C and O, are overabundant in the broad-emission line regions of quasars by a factor
of ∼ 3 relative to the Sun.
Previous studies indicate that the AALs and BALs are located within the scale
of the host galaxy and suggest that the absorbers are physically associated with and
may originate from the quasar outflow. For example, the strengths of the excited-state
Si ii∗ AALs in the high resolution spectrum of 3C 191 indicate a distance of 28 kpc from
the quasar assuming the gas is photonionized (Hamann et al. 2001). By studying the
metastable excited levels of Si ii and Si ii∗, Dunn et al. (2010) determines the distance to
the outflow for attenuated and unattenuated SEDs of ∼ 6 kpc or ∼ 17 kpc respectively.
Variability analysis of a C iv NAL complex towards quasar HS 1603+3820 constrains
an upper limit on the distance of r ≤ 6 kpc from the continuum source (Misawa et al.
2005).
Although it is generally agreed upon that intrinsic absorption lines are formed
in an outflow from the central engine, there is no consensus on the geometry or the
driving force of such an outflow. In the model of Murray et al. (1995), which was
developed further by Proga et al. (2000), the wind is launched from the entire surface
of the accretion disk, with many denser, absorbing filaments distributed throughout. In
this picture, the BALs appear at low latitudes (small angles from the plane of the disk)
when the line of sight passes directly through the dense, high velocity wind. The NALs
could form at higher latitudes when the line of sight intercepts a dense filament in the
hot, low-density flow. Elvis (2000), instead, proposed a funnel-shaped thin shell outflow
model, in which the wind rises vertically from a narrow range of radii on a disk in the
164
BELR. The high-ionization UV NALs and the X-ray “warm absorbers” are seen when
the disk is viewed at a low latitude, through the wind. When viewed along the fast
outflow, the full range of velocity is seen in absorption with a large total column density,
giving rise to a BAL. Recent work indicates that the column densities measured in the
X-ray spectra of quasars hosting intrinsic NALs are considerably lower than what the
Elvis (2000) scenario posits (Misawa et al. 2008; Chartas et al. 2009b), which suggests
a preference on the model of Murray et al. (1995). There is also a suggestion that in
some objects, the outflows are directed in the polar direction, parallel to the axis of the
accretion disk (see, for example, Ghosh & Punsly 2007; Zhou et al. 2006a; Brotherton
et al. 2006). In the context of such a picture, and by analogy with equatorial wind
models, the absorbers giving rise to NALs could be detached from the dense part of
the outflow and become visible along different lines of sight. Previous studies have
shown that the absorbing clumps originate at similar physical locations and are driven
by radiative acceleration. This is supported by the explanation of a double trough in the
C iv BAL by the “line-locking” effect (e.g., Arav et al. 1995). A striking case can be
seen in Srianand et al. (2002), which reports an observation of a highly structured flow
in which distinct components have similar velocity separations.
Misawa et al. (2007) identified two families of intrinsic absorption lines among
39 intrinsic NAL systems. The “strong Nv” family is characterized by strong, partially
covered Nv, relatively weak Lyα (less than twice the equivalent width of Nv), occa-
sionally detected C iv, and Ovi lines (sometimes even stronger than the Nv lines). The
“strong C iv” family, on the other hand, is characterized by strong, partially covered
C iv doublets, strong, usually black Lyα lines, and relatively weak or undetected Nv. A
possible third family, characterized by strong Ovi lines is discussed by Ganguly (2011).
They primarily used partial covering to diagnose the intrinsic nature of the systems, i.e.,
they found that the members of the doublet could not be fit simultaneously assuming
full coverage. Depending on the geometries and locations of the continuum source and
broad emission line regions (and empirically on their positions relative to the emission
lines) the absorber can partially cover either or both (Ganguly et al. 1999). There may
be overlap between the C iv and Ovi categories as some absorption systems can possess
both strong C iv and Ovi lines. Further observations covering both of these lines are
needed to investigate this issue. These different types of NALs are of interest because
they may allow us to probe different regions of the outflow. These three families of NALs
may represent different lines of sight through the outflow, which is also suggested by the
relations between the properties of UV NALs and the X-ray properties of the quasars
that display them (e.g., Chartas et al. 2009b).
The question we address in this paper is the origin of the intrinsic Nv NALs. To
this end we construct photoionization models for the strong Nv absorption systems in
the spectra of three radio-quiet quasars from the HIRES/Keck sample studied by Misawa
et al. (2007). This sample contains 37 optically bright quasars at z = 2 − 4. We choose
these particular three quasars because their spectra exhibit characteristics of the “strong
Nv” family. In addition, these three systems offer many observational constraints be-
cause many ions are covered in their spectra, and the Nv absorption lines have relatively
simple profiles. Similar systems, containing multiple absorption components spread over
165
thousands of km s−1 have been reported in the spectra of RX J1230.8+0115 (Ganguly
et al. 2003) and 3C 351 (Yuan et al. 2002).
In Section 5.2, we describe the absorption profiles of the three intrinsic Nv NAL
systems. In Section 5.3, we introduce our method for modelling the three systems using
the Cloudy photoionization code (Ferland 2006). The modelling results, in the form of
constraints on metallicity, ionization parameter, and volume number density are pre-
sented in Section 5.4. In Section 5.6, we discuss possible interpretations of our results on
the location of the absorbers in the quasar winds. We present a summary and conclusion
in Section 5.7. The cosmology we use in this paper is ΩΛ = 0.7, ΩM = 0.3, h = 0.7,
which leads to the luminosity distances listed in Table 5.1.
5.2 Data
The Keck/HIRES spectra of our three intrinsic Nv systems are described in
Misawa et al. (2007). The spectral resolution is R = 37, 500, or ∼ 7 km s−1. Table 5.1
summarizes the basic properties of the three absorption systems and of the quasars that
host them. The transitions listed are detected at a 5σ confidence level at the NAL
redshift. The sign of the velocity of a system is taken to be positive, if the line is
blueshifted, i.e., if the gas appears to be outflowing relative to the quasar; this is the
opposite convention from that adopted in Misawa et al. (2007). In the same table, we also
list the 4400 Å flux densities (taken from Misawa et al. 2007), as well as the bolometric
luminosities and ionizing photon rates (obtained as described in §5.3).
Figures 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3 present, for each system, absorption profiles for transi-
tions which are used as modelling constraints. An example of the best models we have
found (discussed in later sections) is also shown in each figure. The velocity of an entire
system is defined by the optical depth-weighted center of the strongest member of the
Nv doublet. We describe each system below.
HE0130−4021 (zabs = 2.973915; Fig. 5.1): The system is found ∼ 4000 km s−1 blue-
ward of the quasar emission redshift, just within the associated region. This system
is kinematically more complex than the other two, with 9 components in each Nv
line, spreading over ∼ 500 km s−1. All but one of these components have small
coverage fractions (Cf < 0.5; see Table 5.2). The strong features in the Lyα panel
of Figure 5.1 at ∼ −280, 50, 110, and 210 km s−1 cannot be Lyα components
because the corresponding Lyβ components are not detected. Thus only portions
of the Lyα profile can be used as constraints, but it is clear that the absorption in
Lyα is quite weak. The Ovi doublet appears to be detected in many of the same
components as Nv, though inconsistencies between Ovi λ1032 and Ovi λ1038 be-
tray a number of blends. For this system the alignment of kinematic components of
different transitions is convincing and it seems at least some of the Ovi absorption
is real. We can use the observed absorption at the positions of Ovi λλ1032, 1038
as an upper limit.
Q1009+2956 (zabs = 2.649510; Fig. 5.2): This system is ∼ 450 km s−1 redward of
the quasar emission redshift. The Nv λλ1239, 1242 doublet of this system exhibits
partial coverage in each of the three blended kinematic (Voigt) components required
166
to fit its asymmetric profile, with the strongest component having Cf = 0.70±0.06
(Fig. 5.2 and Table 5.2). Lyα and Lyβ are detected, but are unusually weak
compared to Nv. The ratio of Lyα to Lyβ is reasonable, but differences in the
shapes of these lines, particularly the presence of a wing on the red side of the Lyβ
profile, suggest a possible blend with another line. We will thus weight the Lyα line
more heavily as a constraint. Narrow C iii λ977 and Svi λ933 lines appear to be
detected, albeit with some uncertainty because of their location in the Lyα forest.
The red member of Svi λλ933, 945 doublet is heavily blended and thus cannot be
used to judge whether this doublet is truly detected or not. The feature at the
position of Si iii λ1207 is not aligned with the C iii λ977 and Nv λ1239 profiles
and is too broad, so we believe that we only have an upper limit on Si iii λ1207
absorption from this system. There is absorption at the positions of both members
of the Ovi λλ1032, 1038 doublet, however the minima are not aligned with each
other or with the Nv profile. The Ovi λ1032 is too broad relative to Ovi λ1038,
and both transitions are clearly affected by blends. The limits on Ovi for this
system are not restrictive constraints for our models.
HS1700+6416 (zabs = 2.7125; Fig. 5.3): This system is ∼ 750 km s−1 blueward of the
quasar emission redshift. The Nv λλ1239, 1242 and C iv λλ1548, 1550 doublets are
detected in this system, as well as Lyα and Lyβ (Fig. 5.3). The same system was
presented in Barlow et al. (1997), who found it to vary significantly on a time scale
of ∼ 6.5 months in its rest-frame. The central absorption is detected at z ∼ 2.7125
(vrel ∼ 0 km s−1) and a weaker component is found at ∼ 325 km s−1. The central
component shows an asymmetry, indicating the need for two Voigt components
for an adequate fit. The feature at ∼ 70 km s−1 in the Lyα panel cannot be
Lyα belonging to this absorption system, since no counterpart is detected in the
Lyβ panel. All three components of the Nv profile show partial coverage, with
coverage fractions between 0.33 and 0.43 (Table 5.2). The Lyβ component at
0 km s−1 is too strong relative to Lyα, indicating a blend that affects the Lyβ so
that it can only be used as an upper limit. If saturated (and affected by partial
coverage), Lyβ could have an equivalent width equal to that of Lyα, but it can
never have a larger equivalent width. The Ovi doublet lies in the Lyα forest, such
that it is hard to evaluate whether it is detected for this system or not. If all of
the detected absorption, either at 0 km s−1 or at 325 km s−1, is due to Ovi, the
absorber would have a much larger coverage fraction than the Nv, C iv, or Lyα
absorbers at these same velocities. In our modelling we will take the absorption
lines coincident with Ovi as an upper limit, but we note that the minima of the
absorption at ∼ 325 km s−1 in both members of the Ovi doublet are at the same
velocity as those in the Nv. Because of this, we will later consider whether viable
single phase models can also explain this possible Ovi absorption.
Transitions appearing in Figures 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3, but not described above, pro-
vide limits for model constraints, either because they are not detected or because they
thought to be affected by blends.

5.3 Photoionization Modeling
Our calculations were performed with version 07.02.01 of Cloudy, last described
by Ferland et al. (1998). Our modeling assumes a series of plane-parallel slabs of gas
(clouds) exposed to the ionizing continuum from the central engine. The gas within
each absorbing cloud is assumed to have a uniform density, metallicity and abundance
pattern. In most cases, we assume a solar abundance pattern (Holweger 2001), so that
for every element i, Ai/Ai,⊙ = Z/Z⊙ where Ai = ni/nH. When an adequate fit cannot
be achieved using the solar abundance pattern, we consider deviations. The intensity of
the ionizing continuum is parameterized by the ionization parameter,
U =
nγ
nH
=
1
4πr2 c nH
∫ ǫ2
ǫ1
Lǫ
ǫ
dǫ, (5.1)
where r is the distance of the illuminated face of the cloud from the continuum source,
ǫ1 is the lowest energy required to photoionize the gas, i.e., ǫ1 = 1 Ry, and ǫ2 is the
high energy cutoff of the SED. In our model, we take ǫ2 = 7.354 × 106 Ry. Each of
our models are specified by U and nH, which (given the quasar luminosity and spectral
shape) corresponds to a given r. We also assume that all the ions within a cloud have
the same coverage fraction, and that the gas cloud is in a state of thermal equilibrium,
so it is parameterized by a single electron temperature, Te. The assumption of the same
coverage fraction for different lines is likely to be valid for those from ions with similar
ionization states, particularly C iv and Nv which are the most important constraints for
out models. Lyα absorption may also arise from additional regions, but in any case will
provide a lower limit on metallicity. In our favored models, the clouds are optically thin
to the incident continuum so that the incident SED does not change after the ionizing
photons pass through an absorbing cloud.
We have measured the Doppler b parameters, column densities and coverage frac-
tions of the Nv doublets, as we describe below, and optimized on these values (i.e., we
required that Cloudy models produce them). We choose Nv as the transition on which
we optimize because it is located in a relatively “clean” spectral region where there are
few blends. This allows us to determine its column density, Doppler parameter, and cov-
erage fraction via Voigt profile fitting. The code AUTOVP (Dave et al. 1997) is used to
derive an initial solution, and then MINFIT is used to determine the minimum number
of components that produce an adequate fit. The goal of the modeling exercise is to
reproduce the observed absorption profiles for all other ions by adjusting three physical
parameters: metallicity, Z/Z⊙, ionization parameter, U , and hydrogen number density,
nH.
5.3.1 Voigt Profile Fitting of the N v Doublets
The approach of the MINFIT code is to first “overfit” the system using many
Voigt components and then to reject components that do not improve the fits at a
confidence level above 95%. This fitting technique has been used extensively in studies
of intervening Mg ii systems (e.g., Ding et al. 2003; Ding, Charlton & Churchill 2005;
Lynch, Charlton & Kim 2006). Table 5.2 lists the resulting fitting parameters. It is
168
essential to include the coverage fractions as free parameters in the fitting process for
these systems since Cf = 1 does not provide acceptable fits to these doublets within the
observed uncertainties (Fig. 5.4; Misawa et al. 2007).
5.3.2 Specification of the Ionizing Continuum
Although multi-band photometry and/or spectra of these three quasars are not
available over the entire spectral range, some observational data are available to place
constraints on the input SED. We consider three possible quasar SEDs.
1. A typical quasar SED from Elvis et al. (1994). This is a mean SED determined
from 29 moderately luminous quasars.
2. A broken power-law SED from Mathews & Ferland (1987). This is a mean contin-
uum determined by combining direct observations, without distinguishing between
radio quiet and radio loud quasars.
3. A multi-component continuum with either a small, a medium, or a big blue bump
(BB) (see the Cloudy document, Hazy § 6.2, for details), parameterized by kTBB =
10 eV, 100 eV and 300 eV, respectively (Casebeer et al. 2006). By adjusting the
parameters of this prescription we produce three different strengths of the BB,
which we list in Table 5.3 (“small”,“medium”, and “big”). For each BB strength
we examine three different values of αox (denoted as i, ii, and iii in Table 5.3),
which gives us nine different SED shapes for this model.
We utilize three parameters to constrain the SED: αo, αx, and αox, which are the
UV/optical spectral slope, X-ray band spectral slope and optical-X-ray spectral slope, re-
spectively (assuming that fν ∝ ν+α). The last is defined as αox = 0.3838 log
[
ℓν(2 keV)/ℓν(2500 Å)
]
,
where ℓν(2 keV) and ℓν(2500 Å) are the monochromatic luminosities at 2 keV and at
2500 Å (Tananbaum et al. 1979).
The low resolution (R ∼ 2000) UV/optical spectrum of HS1700+6416 is available
from the Data Release 5 (DR5) quasar catalog (Schneider et al. 2007) of the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS; York et al. 2000). We fitted the underlying continuum using a power-
law, with a small Balmer bump and the iron emission forest superimposed (Vanden Berk
2011), and obtained αo = −0.47 (see Table 5.3). This object was also observed by
Chandra and XMM-Newton. The X-ray spectrum was adequately fit with a power-law
index ∼ −1 (αx = −1.2 ± 0.2 for the Chandra spectrum and αx = −1.1 ± 0.2 for the
XMM–Newton spectrum; Misawa et al. 2008). Thus we adopted αx = −1.
To find αox we used the empirical correlation between it and the 2500 Å quasar
luminosity (Vignali et al. 2003; Strateva et al. 2005; Steffen et al. 2006). We adopt the
αox-ℓν(2500 Å) relation by Steffen et al. (2006):
αox = (−0.137 ± 0.008) log ℓν(2500 Å) + (2.638 ± 0.240) .
The 2500 Å luminosity is calculated as ℓν(2500 Å) = 4πd
2
Lfν(2500 Å), in which dL is the
luminosity distance and fν(2500 Å) is the rest-frame flux, derived from an extrapolation
169
of the flux density at 4400 Å (Misawa et al. 2007) assuming fν ∝ ν−0.44 (Vanden Berk
et al. 2001). Thus, for HS1700+6416 we find αox = −1.87
The three spectral indices for HS1700+6416, from spectroscopic observations, are
compared to those for possible quasar SEDs (Table 5.3). We find that the Medium BB
iii SED best matches the observational constraints thus, we use this SED as the input
ionizing flux for HS1700+6416. This SED is plotted as a solid line in Fig. 5.5.
We measured αo of the other two quasars from the low-resolution spectra of
Q1009+2956 (Burles & Tytler 1998) and HE0130−4021 (Osmer et al. 1994), respectively.
These UV/optical power-law indices are determined by connecting two empirical “line-
free” regions redward of the Lyα emission line and are ∼ −0.25 for both quasars. The
2500 Å luminosities for these two quasars are determined in the same manner as for
HS1700+6416 and their αox values are both ∼ −1.8. There have not been any X-ray
spectral observations of Q1009+2956 or HE0130−4021 so, we assume they have the same
αx as HS1700+6416. Generally, the photoionization cross section decreases rapidly with
photon energy so the ionization state is not sensitive to the X-ray spectral slope. We
then also use the Medium BB iii multi-component SED for both of these quasars, but
we adjust the optical slope to −0.25 to match the observations. This SED is shown as a
dotted line in Fig. 5.5.
We have integrated the above SEDs to compute the bolometric luminosities and
ionizing (E > 1 Ry) photon rates for the three quasars (Lbol and Q, respectively). We
first normalized them to match the 4400 Å luminosity density of each quasar (using the
flux density and luminosity distance from Table 5.1). The resulting values are listed in
Table 5.1; they will be useful for our estimates of the properties of the absorbing gas in
§5.6.2.
5.3.3 Comparison of Cloudy Model Results to the Data and the Role of the
Coverage Fraction
Cloudy calculates the electron temperature based upon thermal and ionization
balance. Using this temperature, we calculate the microturbulence velocity for Nv based
on its observed total Doppler b parameter assuming that both of them follow Gaussian
distribution. We then calculate the b parameters for all other elements by combining
this turbulent b with the thermal b, calculated from the atomic weight and the electron
temperature. Using these b parameters and the column densities of each ion, output
by Cloudy, we synthesize noiseless model spectra, convolving with a Gaussian function
which represents the instrumental profile. We compare the theoretical profiles with the
observed ones using a χ2 test in combination with visual inspection. The wavelength
range within which χ2 is evaluated is carefully chosen because even a single pixel affected
by a blend or an instrumental a artifact can dominate the χ2 values.
We apply a grid method in (Z/Z⊙)–U–nH space to search for acceptable solutions
by comparing model profiles to the observed absorption lines. In order to better visualize
the models and compare them to the observed spectra, we take constant-nH slices and
examine combinations of (Z/Z⊙) and U in this 2-dimensional parameter space. The
ranges of (Z/Z⊙), U , and nH we explore vary depending on the specific system, but
170
typically they span 1 . log (Z/Z⊙) . 3
1, −1.5 . log U . 1.5, and 2 . log(nH/cm−3) .
14. The initial increments are ∆ log (Z/Z⊙) = 0.1, ∆ log U = 0.1, and ∆ log(nH/cm
−3) =
2. Finer grids are applied only if necessary. We assume that different kinematic (Voigt)
components represent different parcels of gas, which we model separately. However,
if kinematic components are blended together, we start by assuming that they are all
described by the same model parameters. We refer to such models as the “initial” or
“preliminary” models. After finding the best preliminary solution, we vary (Z/Z⊙) and
U for each kinematic component within 0.2 dex of their preliminary values to seek better
solutions with smaller χ2 values.
In the process of producing synthetic line profiles for comparison to the observed
spectra, we make use of the coverage fraction inferred from the relative strengths of the
lines in the Nv doublet (see Table 5.2). Since Cf represents the fraction of photons
from the background source that pass through the absorber, we effectively dilute all the
absorption lines of a given system by a factor equal to Cf . We have to assume that the
same value of Cf applies to all transitions for lack of additional information. This need
not be the case in general, however; Misawa et al. (2007) do find cases where different
resonance doublets in the same system yield different values of Cf , for example. In one
of our three quasars, HS1700+6416, we do have separate measurements of Cf for the
Nv and C iv doublets but they agree with each other within uncertainties. We return
to the issue of the covering factor in Section 5.5 where we discuss the possibility of the
absorbers covering different fractions of the continuum and broad-emission line sources.
5.4 Photoionization Model Results
5.4.1 HE0130−4021
This absorption complex can be described by nine kinematic components (Fig. 5.1
and Table 5.2). These components are blended so we model them by first assuming that
they are described by the same model parameters. Si iv λ1396 is not detected, which
yields a lower limit on log U . Although Ovi λλ1032, 1038 and C iii λ977 do not provide
strong constraints, we require that they are not over-produced by our models. The
Lyα line provides a strong constraint for this system. Because the saturated absorption
troughs around 50 km s−1 and 100 km s−1 are not seen in Lyβ, they cannot be due to
Lyman absorption from this system. These two absorption features actually divide the
whole Lyα absorption system into a red part (positive velocity) and a blue part (negative
velocity), which we can model separately. The blue part comprises Components 1–4 and
9 while the red part consists of Components 5–8. Although this system comprises many
kinematics components, we can still obtain robust results for the coverage fraction of each
component. This is because we fit the blue and the red members doublet simultaneously
so that only features appearing in both of doublets are contribute to the determination
of Cf . The resulting relative uncertainties (listed in Table 5.2) are typically of order 20%,
which includes errors in profile fitting as well as errors in continuum fitting.
1In our initial simulations we tried to reproduce the absorption line strengths with
log (Z/Z⊙) . 1. However, we found that acceptable models require relatively high metalici-
ties, which led us to adopt this range of values in our grid search.
171
We start by seeking models that can reproduce the observed Lyα absorption
complex. For either the red or the blue part of the profile, we can find a series of solutions
for log (Z/Z⊙) and log U on a constant-nH slice. Fig. 5.6 illustrates the methodology we
apply to all systems: it shows the acceptable models for Lyα for log(nH/cm
−3) = 8 and
a range of log (Z/Z⊙) and log U . The highest and lowest possible values of log (Z/Z⊙)
and log U for different values of log(nH/cm
−3) are tabulated in Table 5.4. The blue
and red parts of the profile yield different sets of acceptable model parameters. Fig. 5.6
presents constraints on models based on the observed Ovi λ1032 and Si iv λ1396 lines.
The effect of changing log U and log (Z/Z⊙) on the model profiles of Si iv λ1396 and
Lyα is illustrated in Figures 7a, and 7b. The Ovi λ1032 profile is very insensitive to
metallicity as well as to log U when log U & −1.5. Below this value, the Ovi λ1032
absorption decreases gradually. Because the Ovi doublet is in the Lyα forest, we use
it as an upper limit on the Ovi absorption that a model should produce. However, at
log U ∼ −1.5, the red parts of Ovi 1032,1038 can be adequately fit. Therefore, the
intersection between the acceptable models for the red part of Lyα and the acceptable
models for Ovi 1032 happens at log U ∼ −1.5 and log (Z/Z⊙) ∼ 1.7. This model also
fits the observed C iii λ977 absorption and it does not overproduce Si iv λ1396. For the
blue part of the system, within the range of models that are consistent with the Lyα and
Siiv 1394, the Ovi λ1032 is never overproduced. Since the Ovi is taken as an upper
limit, these models are all considered acceptable, as listed in Table 5.4.
The synthesized line profiles are consistent with the data for values of log(nH/cm
−3)
between 2 and 14. The ranges of log (Z/Z⊙) and log U are slightly different for different
log nH values (Table 5.4). An example of an acceptable model is presented in Fig. 5.1.
There are still discrepancies between the model and the observed spectrum of
Lyα. Perhaps the Lyα line is blended with another transition because the corresponding
absorption trough is not seen in Lyβ. The v ∼ 300 km s−1 absorption trough in the Lyα
window is also underproduced, which seems to suggest an additional weak component
with a small Doppler parameter. Most of the absorption in Ovi is underproduced by
this model, with the exception of that at v ∼ 0 km s−1. The absorption at this velocity
is mainly contributed by Component 9, which is the only component with a coverage
fraction of unity. We have assumed that the Ovi absorption is only an upper limit,
but if it is real, a separate phase would be required that has a larger coverage fraction.
In the other two systems Ovi is similarly underproduced; we discuss this further in
Section 5.4.4.
We have attempted to optimise the model parameters for each kinematic compo-
nent separately but we found that this exercise did not yield useful results. We found
a large number of “pockets” in parameter space, spanning a wide range of parameter
values, where an acceptable fit can be achieved but there is no strong reason to prefer
one particular “pocket” over the others. We attribute this outcome to the fact that the
Lyman series lines that we use as constraints are blended with other lines and the profile
of C iii has a relatively low signal-to-noise ratio. Therefore, Table 5.4 provides the final
summary of acceptable model parameters.
172
5.4.2 Q1009+2956
The absorption-line profile of this system can be reproduced using 3 kinematic
components (Fig. 5.2 and Table 5.2), which are blended together. In addition to Nv,
there are three main constraints: Lyα, C iii λ977, and Svi λ933. We initially as-
sume that the three components have the same parameters. We find that using a
solar abundance pattern, we can always find overlapping regions in parameter space
between the best fits of Lyα and C iii λ977 if log(nH/cm
−3) . 13. These solutions are
at 2.3 . log (Z/Z⊙) . 2.5 and 0.2 . log U . 0.4, (Figs. 7c, and 7d). However, we
cannot find any overlapping parameter combinations between suitable fits for Svi λ933
and C iii λ977. The Svi λ933 solutions also do not intersect with acceptable Lyα solu-
tions, except when log(nH/cm
−3) ≈ 12. For most densities, only if we lower the sulphur
abundance by about 1 dex (relative to the solar abundance pattern) can we obtain ac-
ceptable model profiles for all three of the constraints (Table 5.4). In the case that the
absorption at the position of Svi λ933 is contaminated by blends with unrelated lines,
an even larger sulphur abundance reduction would be required. In principle, it is pos-
sible to produce less Svi λ933 by increasing the nitrogen abundance, since Nv is the
optimized transition, however we find that such an adjustment is not sufficient to fully
resolve the discrepancy. For the special case of log(nH/cm
−3) ≈ 12, the Svi λ933 and
Lyα profiles can both be reproduced for log (Z/Z⊙) ∼ 2.3 and log U ∼ 0.7. For that
case, with a higher ionization parameter, an alternative acceptable model is found if we
raise the carbon abundance by 0.5 dex, leaving the sulfur abundance unchanged from
the solar pattern. These results are summarized in Table 5.4.
We next tune separately the metallicity and ionization parameter of each compo-
nent, assuming that all three components have the same volume density, but allowing
this common value of the density to vary. We select the best model parameters at each
volume density value using χ2 technique and visual inspection (Table 5.5). An example
of acceptable models is presented in Fig. 5.2. To obtain this improved fit we vary the
metallicities and ionization parameters of different components over a range about 0.2
dex. Through this exercise, we require that Svi λ933 is not overproduced. The left wing
of Lyα cannot be well modelled and probably requires another component which may
not be detected in metal-line absorption or may be related to a region to the blue of the
Nv λ1239 profile. We had neglected that in our fit, since we could not consider whether
it was consistent with Nv λ1243. Nevertheless, the modelling results for this system
indicate metallicities considerably higher than the solar values.
5.4.3 HS1700+6416
This absorption system can be described by 3 kinematic components (Fig. 5.3,
Table 5.2). Because the third component, at v ∼ 315 km s−1, is well separated from
the central two components, we determine its parameters independently. Assuming the
central two clouds to have the same parameters, the preliminary best fits, consistent
with both Lyα and C iv λ1549 as well as with undetected transitions, are tabulated in
Table 5.4. In Figures 7e and 7f we plot the profiles of the two central components of
Lyα and C iv in the log (Z/Z⊙)–log U parameter slice around this preliminary best fit for
log(nH/cm
−3) = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12. For 2 . log(nH/cm
−3) . 8, the line strengths are
173
almost independent of density, but for higher densities we see weaker Lyα and slightly
stronger C iv absorption. When log(nH/cm
−3) & 11, the acceptable fits to C iv λ1549
occur at log U ∼ 0.6, but Lyα is underproduced by the models so that it is impossible
to obtain an acceptable fit at these very high densities. Observationally, variability on a
timescale of 6.5 months in the quasar’s rest-frame implies log(nH/cm
−3) > 3 (based on
considerations of the recombination time; see §5.2).
To refine our preliminary models, we next allow the central two components to
have different parameters. Thus, we adjust log (Z/Z⊙) and log U of each cloud sepa-
rately, within ±0.2 dex of the preliminary best fit. A complete tabulation of the best
model parameters at each value of the volume density can be found in Table 5.6. Take
log(nH/cm
−3) = 8 for example, a better fit is found at log (Z/Z⊙) = 1.3, log U = 0.5 for
the first component and log (Z/Z⊙) = 1.6, log U = 0.6 for the second component. Even
for this example, shown in Fig. 5.3, the Lyα components at v ∼ 0 km s−1 are slightly
underproduced. This may imply that an additional component would be needed, or that
the Lyα is blended with a line from a system at another redshift. The latter is not
unlikely given the unidentified component present at v ∼ 70 km s−1
The best fit for the third kinematic component at v ∼ 315 km s−1 is achieved at
log (Z/Z⊙) = 1.7, log U = 1 at log(nH/cm
−3) = 2–8. We cannot obtain any acceptable
fits for log(nH/cm
−3) > 8 because model Lyα profiles become broader than the observed
profiles for cases that match the observed C iv (Figures. 7g and 7h). Combining all three
components, Fig. 5.3 shows one of the acceptable fits we obtain for this system.
5.4.4 The O vi Doublet
The energy required to produce Ovi is much higher (8.371 Ry) than C iv (3.520 Ry)
and Nv (5.694 Ry). Thus, the Ovi doublet probes highly-ionized gas and could, in
fact, arise in a more tenuous gas that is not co-spatial with the gas responsible for the
lower-ionization absorption lines and also has a different coverage fraction of the back-
ground source(s). With the above in mind, we note that in the case of HS1700+6416
(Fig. 5.3), the best model cannot fully reproduce the Ovi absorption in both the central
and redward components. This could signal that the Ovi absorber has a larger cov-
erage fraction. Another possibility is that the Ovi is contaminated by lines from the
Lyman forest, which is supported by the large widths of the “black” troughs around
the Ovi λ1038 line of HS1700+6416 and Q1009+2956 ( Figures. 5.2 and 5.3). Almost
all spectral regions around Ovi for the three quasars have some indication of blending,
which makes the comparison of the synthesized Ovi doublet profile to the data ambigu-
ous. Therefore, we can only use the observed Ovi absorption troughs to set an upper
limit on the absorption produced by our models.
5.5 Partial Coverage of Continuum and Broad-Emission Line Regions
In principle, the intrinsic absorbers could cover different fractions of the con-
tinuum source and the BELR (e.g., Ganguly et al. 1999). Thus an absorption line
superposed on a broad emission line represents the absorption of different fractions of
emission-line and continuum photons. If this is true, the coverage fraction one obtains
174
from fitting a doublet is an effective coverage fraction, which represents the fraction of
the photons from all the background sources that pass through the absorber. Thus, for
an absorption line that is superposed on a broad emission line and the continuum, a
more general expression for the normalized residual flux at a certain velocity is given by
(see Ganguly et al. 1999)
R(v) = 1 −
[
1 − e−τ(v)
]
[Cc(v) + W (v)Ce(v)]
1 + W (v)
(5.2)
(see also the discussion and more general formalism in Gabel et al. 2005). In the above
expression, Cc and Ce represent the coverage fractions of the continuum source and of the
BELR and W = fe/fc is the ratio of the flux contribution of the emission line (without
continuum) and the continuum only at the position of the absorption line. In principle
C and W are functions of velocity across the absorption-line profile. However, since the
absorption lines of interest here are fairly narrow, W does not change appreciably over
the profile of the absorption line and we can regard it as independent of velocity. By
rearranging equation (5.2) one can show that the effective coverage fraction, Cf , can be
expressed as the weighted average of Ce and Cc as
Cf =
Cc + WCe
1 + W
. (5.3)
In practice, we can determine Cf by fitting the profiles of the UV resonance doublets
and W by measuring the strength of the broad emission line relative to the continuum
at the location of the absorption doublet. This leads to a relation between Ce and Cc
but it does not allow us to determine Ce and Cc separately. An example of a graphical
depiction of this relation can be found in Fig. 10 of Ganguly et al. (1999).
The Nv absorption doublet presents a further complication because it is likely to
be superposed on the blend of the Lyα and Nv emission lines. The regions emitting Lyα
and Nv are likely to have a different spatial extent and their coverage fractions should
also be different. This is suggested by the results of reverberation mapping studies (see,
for example Peterson & Wandel 2000; Onken & Peterson 2002; Kollatschny 2003), which
indicate an ionization stratification in the BELR. Under these circumstances, in the
numerator of equations (5.2) and (5.3), we must replace WCe by WLyαCLyα +WN VCNV
and in the denominator, we must replace W by WLyα +WNV. In this new notation CLyα
and CNV are the coverage fractions of the Lyα and Nv emitting regions and WLyα and
WN V are defined in a manner analogous to the definition of W .
Putting aside the above complication, we can invert equation (5.3) to obtain an
expression for Cc, in terms of Cf , W , and Ce. However, since Ce is unknown in practice,
this relation can only lead to upper and lower bounds on Cc, corresponding to Ce = 0
and 1, respectively. Even if the absorption doublet is superposed on a blend of emission
lines, the expression for Cf reduces to equation (5.3) if the BELR is fully covered or not
covered at all. Taking the error bars on the measured quantities into account we obtain
the following expressions for the limits on Cc:
175
Cmax
c
= min
{
1, [1 + (W + δW )](Cf + δCf )
}
and (5.4)
Cmin
c
= max
{
0, [1 + (W − δW )](Cf − δCf ) − (W + δW )
}
,
where δX denotes the error bar on X.
In an analogous manner, we can use equation (5.3) to derive limits on Ce, using
the fact that Cc must lie between 0 and 1. The corresponding expressions, including
uncertainties on the measured quantities, are:
Cmax
e
= min
{
1,
[1 + (W + δW )](Cf + δCf )
(W − δW )
}
and (5.5)
Cmine = max
{
0,
[1 + (W − δW )](Cf − δCf )
(W + δW ) − 1
}
. (5.6)
We have used flux-calibrated, low-resolution spectra of the three quasars to mea-
sure the values of W for the Lyα, and Nv absorption lines (as well as C iv absorption
line in the case of HS1700+6416). Using these values of W and the values of Cf from
Table 5.2 we have estimated the limits on the coverage fractions of the continuum source
and the BELR, Cc and Ce, which we list in Table 5.7. Limits derived from the Lyα
absorption line involve the assumption that the effective coverage fraction of the Lyα
absorber is the average of the values measured for the Nv absorber, which need not
be correct. Nevertheless, these limits appear to be consistent with those derived from
the Nv and C iv doublets. The limits on the continuum coverage fraction derived from
different Nv kinematic components in the same quasar appear to be consistent with each
other with one exception: component 9 of HE0130−4021, for which the effective coverage
fraction is measured to be Cf = 1. The only reliable limit on the BELR coverage fraction
comes from the C iv doublet of HS1700+6416.
A closely related issue is whether the superposition of absorption lines on strong
emission lines dilutes their strengths by different amounts and leads to large errors in our
estimated abundances. The relative strengths of the Lyα and Nv absorption lines are
particularly sensitive to this effect, especially when the blueshift of the absorption lines
is small. In a specific scenario where the absorber covers only the continuum source,
the Lyα absorption line is superposed on the peak of the Lyα emission line and can
be diluted much more than the Nv line which is superposed on the red wing of the
Lyα emission line (the velocity difference between the Lyα and Nv absorption lines is
approximately 5925 km s−1). In such a case, the procedure we follow here to determine
column densities, will lead us to underestimate the column density of Lyα relative to
that of Nv and our models would yield a nitrogen abundance that is higher than the
true one.
Examining the values of W listed in Table 5.7, we see that if such a scenario
is true, the Nv absorption line is actually diluted more than the Lyα absorption line
in HE0130−4021 and HS1700+6416. In other words, in these two quasars we would
176
have underestimated the nitrogen abundance rather than overestimated it. To verify our
expectation quantitatively, we explored a new set of models for HS1700+6416 in which
we assumed that the absorber covers the continuum source but not the BELR. Thus,
we started by adopting the Cf value of Cloud 2 because it is the dominant component
and set Ce = 0 and Cc = 0.64 for all transitions. As a result, the effective coverage
fraction for each transition depends on its W value, e.g., Cf = 0.33 for Nv, Cf = 0.45 for
C iv, and Cf = 0.34 for Lyα. By setting log(nH/cm
−3) = 8, we find an acceptable fit at
(log (Z/Z⊙), log U) = (1.6, 0.8). Compared to our best fit with Cc = Ce, this metallicity
is 0.2 dex higher and the ionization parameter is 0.4 dex higher.
In Q1009+2956 we have the opposite situation, in which WLyα is larger than WN V,
i.e., Lyα is diluted more by emission line than Nv, suggesting that metallicity may have
been overestimated. To assess whether this is indeed the case, we explored a new set of
models in which the Ce has the minimum value possible and Cc has the maximum value
possible. According to Eq. (5.4) and (5.6), these values are Cc = 1 and Ce = 0.245. Thus,
the effective covering factors are Cf = 0.593 for Lyα, and Cf = 0.895 for C iii. By setting
log
(
nH/cm
−3
)
= 8, we find an acceptable model at (log (Z/Z⊙), log U) = (2.5, 0.4), very
similar to our previous best-fitting model which had Cc = Ce.
In the calculation above, we assumed the same average value of W of two members
of the Nv doublets. However, the value of W could differ between the blue and red
members of the Nv doublet, which could affect not only the metallicity estimate but
also values of the coverage fractions. In this particular case, however, the value of W is
the same for the two members of the double, within uncertainties.
5.6 Discussion
5.6.1 High Metallicities
One of the main results of this work is that the metallicities in intrinsic NAL
systems are quite high, log(Z/Z⊙) & 1. Several possible scenarios have been proposed
to produce super-solar metallicities in the vicinity of the central massive black holes of
quasars (Hamann & Ferland 1999). The most natural scenario involves normal galactic
chemical evolution (see Hamann & Ferland 1992, 1993). By considering spectral synthesis
and chemical enrichment models of the Nv/C iv and Nv/He ii emission line ratios, it
was suggested that nitrogen is over-abundant by factors of 2–9 in high redshift (z > 2)
quasars (Hamann & Ferland 1999). Highly evolved gas with log(Z/Z⊙) > 0.5–1.1 is
needed to produce such a large over-abundance of nitrogen. This evolutionary model
requires a large number of high mass stars and implies a flat initial mass function (IMF)
and rapid star formation. The power-law index of the IMF (Φ ∝ Mγ) can be in the
range γ = 0.9− 1.4 and star formation must occur in less than 0.5 Gyr for z > 4 objects
(Hamann & Ferland 1992). This vigorous star formation is consistent with that found in
the environment of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The required time scales, metallicities,
and IMFs are similar to those of elliptical galaxies and bulges of disk galaxies (Romano
et al. 2002). Quasars with more massive host galaxies tend to be more metal rich,
based on observations of massive ellipticals (Clemens et al. 2009; De Lucia et al. 2006).
Therefore, the high abundances derived from our absorbing systems are not surprising,
177
assuming this scenario. The quasars could undergo extensive chemical evolution before
they are observable. Other possible processes within the accretion disk that can lead
to supersolar metalicities include metal enrichment by star trapping (Artymowicz et al.
1993; Shields 1996), star formation (Collin & Zahn 1999; Goodman & Tan 2004), and
non-stellar nucleosynthesis (Kundt 1996). However, it is unlikely that these mechanisms
can produce metallicities as high as log(Z/Z⊙) ∼ 1.
Early measurements of extremely high quasar metallicities based on BALs (Turn-
shek 1986) could have been overestimated because partial coverage of the background
emission was not taken into account, leading to underestimation of column densities
(Hamann & Ferland 1999). However, since our analysis of NALs takes partial coverage
into account, our measurements do not suffer from this bias. Actually, super-solar metal-
licities have also been derived for associated absorption systems in low redshift AGNs
(Papovich et al. 2000; Fields et al. 2005; Gabel et al. 2006). However, those metallicities
are not higher than log(Z/Z⊙) ∼ 1, i.e., somewhat lower than our results for quasar
intrinsic NAL systems. This difference could be due to the higher redshifts of our NAL
systems and/or due to their presence in more luminous AGNs. Rapid and vigorous
stellar evolution is likely to accompany quasar activity, as suggested by a correlation
between the Eddington ratio and the BELR metal abundance spanning 3 orders of mag-
nitude in both quantities (e.g., Shemmer et al. 2004). The resulting high-metallicity gas
could then be diluted with a low-metallicity interstellar medium as it moves outward
in the host galaxy. Eventually, it can escape the host-galaxy potential, enriching the
interstellar and intergalactic medium.
It is also possible that we are looking only at the tip of the iceberg, i.e., at
the most highly enriched gas. A diversity of absorber properties, including metallicity,
has been reported by Petitjean et al. (1996). Not only can absorbers have different
coverage fractions for the continuum and BELR but also different ions/species can have
different coverage fractions due to the multi-phase structure of the gas. Different coverage
fractions for different ions/species are also inferred from the general properties of the
strong C iv family of intrinsic NALs (Misawa et al. 2007), which usually have a saturated
Lyα line, but no detected Nv, implying a lower ionization state for the gas. In the
strong-Nv NAL systems studied in this paper, the Ovi doublet may sometimes be
under-produced by the models, which may be the result of a greater coverage fraction of
the Ovi absorber. Thus the high metallicities that we derived for the NAL gas in which
Nv is detected need not apply to all of the gas surrounding the central engine.
5.6.2 Properties of the Absorbing Gas
The ionization parameters that we obtained are similar to those for BALs. A
typical value of a BAL ionization parameter is log U ∼ 0 (with a range of −1.0 to +0.6;
e.g., Crenshaw et al. 2003; Wampler et al. 1995; Telfer et al. 1998). Both an intrinsic NAL
and a BAL are observed in the spectrum of Q0059−2735 by Wampler et al. (1995), who
show that both can be fitted with log U = −0.7. Hamann (1998) finds that log U & −0.6
is required to model the BAL of PG1254+047, while Telfer et al. (1998), using a two-slab
geometry to model the BAL system of QSO SBS 1542+541, find −1.1 < log U < 0.6 for
the lower-ionization zone and log U & 0.3 for the higher-ionization zone.
178
If we assume that the outflow includes thin filaments (justified below) that are
responsible for the UV absorption lines that we observe, we can estimate the outflow
rate in these filaments as
Ṁ = 4πr2
(
δr
r
)
ρv
(
δΩ
4π
)
, (5.7)
where ρ is the typical mass density of absorbing filaments, r is their typical distance
from the center, δr is their typical thickness in the radial direction and δΩ is the solid
angle they subtend to the center of the flow. We can re-cast the above expression by
using the definition of the ionization parameter, U ≡ Q/4πr2nHc, to replace 4πr2ρ (Q
is the rate of emission of ionizing photons at E > 1 Ry, and nH is the hydrogen number
density). We also note that the thickness of a filament is related to the hydrogen density,
and radial column density, NH, via NH = n δr. Thus we can write
Ṁ = 5.2 × 10−5 N18 v2 f−1
(
Q58
n6 U
)1/2
M⊙ yr
−1 , (5.8)
where NH = 10
18 N18 cm
−2, v = 102 v2 km s
−1, (δΩ/4π) = 10−1 f−1, Q = 10
58 Q58 s
−1,
and nH = 10
6 n6 cm
−3. We also note that from the definition of the ionization parameter,
we can obtain an estimate of the distance of the absorbing filament from the ionizing
source.
To justify the assumption that the absorbers are thin, we note that using the
definition of U and NH = n δr, we obtain δr/r = N
2
H
4πcU/nHQ. The values of NH
(neutral plus ionized) inferred from our photoionization models are in the following range:
log(NH/cm
−2) ∼ 16–19 for HE0130–4021, log(NH/cm−2) ∼ 17–18 for Q1009+2956, and
log(NH/cm
−2) ∼ 19 for HS1700+6416, the values of U are given in Tables 5.4–5.6 and
the values of Q are given in Table 5.1. Thus, any combination of values of the above
quantities yields δr/r < 0.01 which indicates that the absorbers are geometrically thin
along the line of sight.
We can now use equation 5.8 to obtain constraints on the mass outflow rate.
The necessary values of NH, v, U and Q are given in Tables 5.4–5.6. We also use a
value of f−1 ∼ 5 based on the results of Misawa et al. (2007). Unfortunately, we have
very poor constraints on the hydrogen volume density, which lead to a very wide range
of values for the mass outflow rate, i.e. Ṁ ∼ few M⊙ yr−1 for the lowest densities
and Ṁ < 10−4 M⊙ yr
−1 for nH ≥ 1010 cm−3. The kinetic power of these filaments
is negligible compared to the electromagnetic luminosity (εk ≡ 12Ṁ v
2/Lbol . 10
−5),
however they may be embedded in a hotter, more massive outflow or they may be
accompanied by a more massive outflow along a different line of sight.
Finally, we note that the poor constraints on the density also lead to poor con-
straints on the distance of the filament from the ionizing source, r. In Tables 5.5–5.6
we list the constraints on the radial distance of the filaments as a function of density
for Q1009+2956 and HS1700+6416 (the results for HE0130–4021 are very similar). For
nH ≥ 109 cm−3, the absorbers turn out to be very close to the ionizing source, at dis-
tances comparable to the size of the BELR, while at the lowest densities, the filaments
are located in the outskirts of the host galaxy.
179
5.7 Summary and Conclusions
In this paper, we modelled the intrinsic NAL systems in the spectra of the quasars
HE0130−4021, Q1009+2956, and HS1700+6416, We identify these systems as intrinsic
because they exhibit partial coverage in the Nv λλ1239, 1242 doublet. Using the pho-
toionization code Cloudy, we simulate and reconstruct each absorption feature observed
in a system by adjusting the metallicity (relative to the Sun), Z/Z⊙, ionization param-
eter, U and hydrogen volume density, nH. Our main conclusions are:
1. All three intrinsic systems have metallicities of log(Z/Z⊙) & 1–2, regardless of
constraints on U or nH. We find the high metallicities that we infer cannot alter-
natively be explained by different coverage fractions of the continuum source and
BELR. The origin of these supersolar metallicities is unknown, but we speculate
that they may result from intensive star formation before the quasar becomes ob-
servable. They could also be related to an inhomogeneous metallicity distribution
in the vicinity of the quasar central engine.
2. All three intrinsic systems require high ionization parameters, log U ∼ 0, which are
similar to those derived for BALs.
3. We can constrain the coverage fractions of the continuum source and the BELR
separately, and find that the continuum source is not fully covered by the absorbers.
4. Although we cannot constrain the hydrogen volume density very well, we do find
that the widths of the synthesized line profiles become larger than the observed
ones at very high densities. This is a result of a sharp increase in temperature
at high densities, produced by free-free absorption of infrared photons by free
electrons. This leads us to conclude that the hydrogen volume density is in the
range 2 . log(nH/cm
−3) . 9.
5. As a result of the large range of possible densities we cannot obtain robust estimates
of the mass outflow rate in the filaments responsible for the Nv absorption. We
can conclude, nevertheless, that Ṁ . few M⊙ yr
−1, and the corresponding power
is a negligible fraction of the electromagnetic luminosity.
6. The strength of the Ovi λλ1032, 1038 doublet is underproduced by the models
that reproduce the other absorption lines. This suggests that the Ovi lines are
either contaminated by lines in the Lyman forest of that they arise in a separate
gas phase with a larger coverage fraction.
The strong-Nv absorbers studied in this paper make up one of two, apparently
distinct, families of intrinsic absorber identified by (Misawa et al. 2007). Our next goal is
to study the physical properties of the other family of absorbers, the strong-C iv family
and probe the origin of the two families.

Transitions are ordered by increasing ionization potential, except that Lyα and Lyβ

by adjusting the photoionization model parameters (see Section 5.4 for details). We
mark each kinematic (Voigt) component using a tick mark; the component numbers are
printed in the Nv λ1239 panel. The corresponding components for different transitions
have the same partial coverage factor (see Section 5.3). The corresponding components
for different transitions have the same partial coverage factor (see Section 5.3), which
are listed in Table 5.2.

log U = 0.1 for a hydrogen density of log (nH/cm

the frequencies corresponding to 2500 Å and 2 keV since flux densities at these two

Summary of Thesis Results
In this thesis, we constructed a set of 149 composite quasar spectra from SDSS
DR3 quasar catalog using the spectral binning, averaging and weighting techniques in
Vanden Berk et al. (2001). The composite spectrum set covers a wide range of redshift
with 0 . z <. 5 and wide range of luminosity with 40.5 . lλ(2200 Å) . 43.5. Using
this spectrum, we studies the general trend of UV spectral shape. For quasars at a
similar redshift, the ones with lower luminosity tend to be redder than the ones with
higher luminosity. For quasars with a similar luminosity, the ones at higher redshift tend
to be redder than the ones at lower redshift. The Baldwin Effect is an anti-correlation
between the emission line EW and UV luminosity. Using the composite spectrum set,
we found that while the slopes of the Baldwin Effect do not change over redshift, the
amplitudes exhibit a significant trend over redshift. At the certain luminosity, the EW
of C iv λ1549 may change 0.2 dex from z ∼ 1.4 to z ∼ 4.5; the EW of Mg ii λ2798 may
change 0.3 dex from z ∼ 0.4 to z ∼ 2.2. The redshift dependence of this correlation is an
important contributor to the scatter of the Baldwin Effect of a quasar sample covering
a wide range of redshifts. There is a monotonic trend of the mean emission line shifts
with luminosity for several emission lines such as H i λ5877, C iv λ1549, Al iii λ1857,
C iii] λ1908, and Mg ii λ2798. The emission line width, parameterized by FWHM is
positively correlated to luminosity. Similar to the Baldwin Effect, the amplitude of this
correlation also depends on redshift. At a given luminosity, the FWHM of C iv λ1549
trends to be lower at higher redshifts (see Chapter 2).
The C iv Baldwin Effect is driven by both αox and lν(2500 Å) or equivalently,
by lν(2 keV) and lν(2500 Å). This result implies that changes in the ionizing flux induce
changes in the ionization state of the BELR, producing more C iv ions when the SED
becomes harder, and vice versa. No correlation is found between EW(Fe Kα) and either
αox or EW(C iv), implying that Fe Kα is not likely to have the same origin as C iv. Most
of the scatter of the Baldwin Effect as well as the EW(C iv)-αox relation is contributed
by variability (Chapter 3).
We have constructed a quasar catalog with simultaneous UV, optical and X-ray
observations from Swift. This catalog contains 843 quasars, among which 637 have both
UVOT and XRT observations and 354 are detected by both UVOT and XRT. Using a
sample selected from this catalog, we found that the dispersion of the αox-lν(2500 Å)
relation can be reduced by ∼ 10% (Chapter 4).
By modeling the intrinsic NAL systems in the spectra of three quasars, we found
that they processed super-solar metallicity of log(Z/Z⊙) & 2, regardless of constraints
on ionization parameter U and hydrogen volume density nH, implying intensive star
formation before quasars become observable. We find a high ionization parameter,
202
log U ∼ 0, consistent over three absorption systems. By constraining the coverage fac-
tion of the continuum source and the BELR separately, we found that the continuum
source is likely to be partially covered by absorbers. We conclude that the accretion rate
Ṁ . few M⊙ yr
−1, and the corresponding power is a negligible fraction of the electro-
magnetic luminosity. The Ovi λλ1032, 1038 doublet is underproduced by the models
that reproduce the other absorption lines, suggesting that the Ovi lines are either con-
taminated by Lyman forest or they arise in a separate gas phase with a larger coverage
fraction (Chapter 5).
We verified the following properties and correlations, which were previously gen-
erally accepted.
• In general, the emission line shift is correlated with the ionization potential; emis-
sion lines produced by high ionization potential ions are more blue shifted than
lines from low ionization ions. (Chapter 2)
• The Baldwin Effect does not only exist for C iv λ1549 but also for other broad
emission lines such as Lyα Si iv λ1396, He ii λ1640, and Mg ii λ2798, but this
trend is not present for Nv λ1239, C iii] λ1908, and Hβ (Chapter 2).
• The αox-lν(2500 Å) correlation is seen in the samples we constructed to study the
C iv Baldwin Effect and the Cleaned sample we constructed from the Swift quasar
catalog (Chapter 4).
Again, this work is intended to provide observational constraints to quasar models.
Although a general super massive black hole – accretion disk model has been established
for many years, detailed structure and physical conditions of each component are still
not well understood, such as the volume density of the BELR and the outflow, the exact
locations of the broad emission lines and the states of the accretion disk which controls
the energy distribution shape as well as the variability. In addition, models should ex-
plain the redshift-dependent properties of quasars. A possible solution to these problems
could be building a large code to numerically modeling the geography, dynamics, radia-
tive transfer, ionization and chemical compositions of the central engine. The physical
conditions must be tuned so that the output emission matches the observational property
constraints.
Observationally, to obtain further constraints on AGN physics, it is not only im-
portant to continue performing many wavelengths and programs of long term monitoring
to study the variability, which are directly informative on the central black mass (e.g.,
Peterson et al. 2004; Denney et al. 2009, 2010) and outflow dynamics (e.g., Misawa et al.
2005). In addition, larger ground based and space telescopes are critical to spatially
resolve the BELR and even the accretion disk. The ongoing Thirty-Meter-Telescope
project (Trimble & Barton 2007) and Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), could
be very helpful on this. Although Chandra and XMM-Newton have produced tremen-
dous successes since launch (see a review by Brandt & Hasinger (2005)), there may not
be large X-ray missions in the next decade except the Astro-H (Takahashi et al. 2010).

Appendix A
Fitting the Continuum of
a Composite SDSS Quasar Spectrum Using CMA-ES
A.1 Introduction
This appendix discribes an algorithm to fit a composite SDSS quasar spectrum
using CMA-ES. Although this algorithm is different from the one used in our thesis, it
has some advantages and produces better results.
Described in Chapter 2, we have constructed a set of 161 composite quasar spectra
binned in redshift and luminosity space from ∼ 80, 000 typical SDSS quasars. Spectra in
the same bin are normalized and averaged, so each composite spectrum represents the
average properties of the spectra in each bin. This is the first time this techinque has been
used to study the evolution over a wide range of luminosity (38.25 . log lλ(2200 Å) .
44.00) and redshift (0 . z . 5).
We have tried two types of algorithms to derive a set of measurements from the
composite spectra.
• The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LMA) is designed to solve multivariate least
squares curve fitting problem (More & Wright 1993). It interpolates between the
Gauss-Newton algorithm (GNA) (Björck 1996) and the method of gradient descent
(Avriel 1993), but it is more robust than the GNA, which means that in many
cases, LMA finds a solution even if it starts far from the final minimum. The
fitting results using this algorithm are displayed in Figure A.1. This method has
some limitations
– We found that to solve a problem with more than 10 free parameters, this
algorithm is sensitive to initial values of parameters. We must provided an
initial guess of the power-law (PL) component, and this estimate must be as
close to the optimal value as possible.
– This algorithm does not work well for the iron templates, which do not have
analytical expressions. The features where the iron emission and the small
blue bump (SBB) cannot be fit well simultaneously (see the over-production
of model flux around 3700 Å). In addition, we could not use this method to
find the proper velocity dispersions of the iron template because the available
dispersion values are discrete.
• Genetic algorithm (GA). GA is a search heuristic that mimics the process of natural
evolution (Banzhaf et al. 1998). This heuristic is routinely used to generate useful
solutions to optimization and search problems. A typical GA algorithm consists
204
of initialization, selection, reproduction and termination. The solutions asymptot-
ically converge to an optimal value under a given criteria. Vanden Berk wrote a
program (not published) using this algorithm to fit the SDSS quasar spectra using
GA, but this program has two disadvantages
– Instead of using the iron emission templates, each low ionization iron emission
line is simulated using one or multiple Gaussian profiles. This requires over a
hundred free parameters, which significantly slows down the fitting process.
GA requires ∼5 – 10 minutes (a typical desktop computer with a 2.0 GHz
processor) to fit a composite quasar spectrum.
– Although the program can produce a nearly perfect fit, the result is unstable.
There are a number of parameter combinations that can produce equally good
fits and it is difficult to determine which is the physical solution.
The limitations and disadvantages of these two methods motivate us develop an
evolutionary algorithm to fit the quasar spectrum. The CMA-ES is an evolutionary algo-
rithm for difficult non-linear non-convex optimization problems in a continuous domain
(Hansen & Kern 2004). It is a second order approach to estimate a positive definite
matrix within an iterative procedure (the covariance matrix). This approach makes the
method feasible on non-separable and/or ill conditioned problems. Because this method
does not require gradients, it is feasible on non-smooth and even non-continuous prob-
lems, as well as “noisy” problems. Previous results using LMA imply that the space of
the objective function is not smooth as the solution varies depending on the initial guess
(Hansen & Ostermeier 2001). The CMA-ES approach is can overcome this problem.
The paper is outlined in the following way. In Section A.2, we describe the
problem in detail; in Section A.3, we present the solution strategy in terms of each step
applied in CMA-ES; in Section A.4, we briefly describe some important issues that arose
when developing the program; in Section A.5, we present our optimization results; and
finally in Section A.6, we discuss the limitations of our approach and potential extension
of this work.
A.2 Problem Description
We are aiming at fitting the underlying continuum of a composite quasar spec-
trum at z = 0.738, and log lν(2500 Å) (see Figure A.1). This continuum is fit by four
components
1. A power-law (PL) continuum, which takes the form fλ = 10
βλα. This component
has two free parameters: the spectral index α and the scaling factor β. In principle,
the variables do not have any constraints but previous studies have found that
α ∼ −1.6 and β ∼6–7.
2. A small blue bump (SBB), which takes the form
fλ =


AB · 1−e

ehc/(kλBTB)−1
· e−(λ−λB)/∆λ, λ ≥ λB

ehc/(kλTB)−1
·
(

)−5
, λ ≤ λB, τ = τB

)3 (A.1)
205
This component has three free parameters: Balmer temperature TB, Balmer optical
depth τB, and scale factor AB. The scale factor should be positive; the other two
parameters do not have constraints. Empirically, τB ∼ 1, and TB ∼ 104. Both λ
and λrmB are in unit of Å and ∆λ = 100 Å.
3. UV iron emission forest. This is a blend of many low ionization iron emission
lines ranging from ∼ 1075 Å to 3090 Å. This component has three free pa-
rameters, the scale factor AU, velocity dispersion vU and relative shift ∆zU
1.
The scale factor should be positive. The velocity dispersion can only be one of
1500, 2000, · · · 9500 km s−1 (set by template grid). In principle, ∆zU can be any
value but typically |∆zU| ≤ 0.005.
4. Optical iron emission forest. This is a blend of many low ionization iron emission
lines ranging from ∼ 3535 Å to ∼ 7534 Å. Similar to the UV template, this com-
ponent also has three free parameters, the scale factor AO, velocity dispersion vO
and relative shift ∆zO. Again, vO can only be one of 1500, 2000, · · · , 9500 km s−1,
and |∆zO| ≤ 0.005.
A summary of the free parameters and their permitted values are listed in Table A.1.
We use the reduced χ2 value as the objective function:
χ2 =
1
N − n − 1
N
∑
i=1
(
fi − fe,i
)2
σ2
i
in which N is the number of benchmark wavelength points, which is used to compare
the model and the observed fluxes; n is the number of variables; fi is the interpolated
observed flux value at wavelength point i; fe,i is the expected (calculated) flux value at
wavelength point i, and σi is the interpolated observational uncertainty at wavelength
point i. In this problem, we have N = 50 benchmark points and n = 11 variables.
A.3 Solution Strategy
We apply the CMA-ES as the method to solve this problem. This algorithm
involves sampling, selection, cumulation and updating operations (Hansen & Ostermeirer
1996). The problem is initialized as Table A.2 and each parameter shown below such as
x, m and z are also described in Table A.2. Each generation loop consists the following
steps.
1. Generate and evaluate λ offspring
xi = m + σzi, zi ∼ Ni (0,C) , i = 1, 2, · · · , λ
fi = χ
2 (xi)
1
This is the shift of the template with respect to the quasar spectrum itself, not the redshift
of the quasar relative to the observer.
206
Vector m has N elements, and C is an N × N matrix (the covariant matrix). In
this step, we apply a death penalty to the two velocity dispersion values vU and
vO. If they fail to fall into the range of [1500, 9500], we simply discard this value
and re-draw a new set of random numbers. However, if the number of failures is
greater than 10, we stop drawing and adopt the boundary value. When evaluating
the fitness function, we apply a penalty term fp(x) to the fitness function based on
the value of redshift ∆zU and ∆zO, so that
f̃ (xi) = f (xi) + fp (xi)
fp (xi) = (C · t)2 · G (xi)
G (xi) =
4
∑
k=1
max [0, 5 × gk (xi)]2
The gk(xi) are the constrained items [gk(xi) ≤ 0]:
g1=∆zU − 0.005
g2=−∆zU − 0.005
g3=∆zO − 0.005
g4=−∆zO − 0.005
In the equations above, C = 0.5 and, t is the generation number.
2. Sort offspring by the penalized function f̃(xi) and compute the weighted mean.
Although we sort the offspring using the penalized function, we still output the
unpenalized function fp(xi), because it reflects the real goodness-of-fit regardless
of penalty term. In addition, f̃(xi) involves the generation number t, so even if the
best f̃(xi) decreases in the first few generations, will increase after a certain point.
After sorting the offspring ascendingly, we select the first µ offspring as the parents
to calculate the weighted mean. The weighted mean after selecting µ offspring is
ms
j
=

∑
i=1
wix

, j = 1, 2, · · · , N
Note that xs is a matrix of µ × N and xs is selected from x based on the fitness
function so x0j , j = 1, 2, · · · , N contains the best offspring and thus has the heaviest
weight w0 (see appendix).
3. Cumulation: update the evolution paths. Conceptually, the evolution path is the
path the strategy takes over a number of generation steps, which can be expressed
as a sum of consecutive steps of the (weighted) mean m. To accomplish this
task, we iterate two path vectors, pσ and pc, which represent the path of σ and
covariance matrix C. Both pσ or pc has two terms. The first term is the vector
itself in the last iteration multiplied by a decay factor. This term causes the vector
norm to decrease. The second term is based on the weighted mean of the selected
offspring with a normalization factor and directs the evolution path to the optimal
207
value. This step is a preparation to the covariance matrix adaption and step size
adaption in the succeeding steps. The equations used to calculate these paths and
the updates of evolution paths pσ and pc, are shown below.

4. Adapt covariance matrix C. This is the essential part of the algorithm and the
reason why it is named as covariance-matrix adaption evolutionary algorithm. The
adaption equation includes three terms. The first term is the covariance matrix
itself multiplied by a decay factor. Again, this term decreases the norm of the
covariance matrix. The second term is rank one update plus a minor correction
based on the evolutionary path pc; This term can learn straight ridges in O(n)
rather than O(n2) function evaluations. The third term is rank µ update which is
based on the weighted cross product of the selected offspring. The rank µ update
increases the possible learning rate in large populations and also reduces the num-
ber of necessary generations roughly from O(n2) to O(n) Hansen & Koumoutsakos
(2003). Therefore, the rank µ update is the primary mechanism whenever a large
population size is used (say λ > 3n + 10). The quations for adaption of covariance
matrix C is

offspring.
5. Finally, we update the step size σ. The reason for a step control is that the
covariance matrix update can hardly increase the variance in all directions simul-
taneously. In other words, the overall scale of search, the global step-size cannot
be increased effectively (Andreas Ostermeier 1995). In our investigation, we apply
208
the path length control (cumulative step-size adaption) as recommended by Beyer
& Arnold (2006). The equation for adaption of step size σ is.

.
6. Correct C. To ensure that C is a symmetric matrix, we enforce symmetry by
replacing the lower triangle elements with the upper triangle elements.
7. We apply three criteria to terminate the generation loop
(a) The best fitness is below the pre-defined value.
(b) The number of generations is greater than the maximum number of genera-
tions allowed (104).
(c) The change of the best fitness value is smaller than 0.05 for 20 consecutive
generations.
(d) The change of the best fitness value is positive for 20 consecutive genera-
tions. Theoretically, this could never happen, but it exists when the objective
function approaches the optimal value.
A.4 Program Design
The coding design basically follows the flow of the loop in Section A.3; here we
briefly mention some special aspects that arose to when developing the code.
• To avoid reading the iron emission templates from hard drive each time we evalu-
ate the fitness function, we upload template spectra of all the velocity dispersions
before the generation loop. This requires a few seconds of some overhead computa-
tional time, but it significantly reduces the computational time required to evaluate
the objective function. In each generation, we must evaluate the objective function
for at least 220 times (in the default situation).
• The available values of vU and vO are not continuous. As a result, we must perform
a discretization to make sure that they are integer multiples of 500 km s−1 before
evaluating the fitness function.
• To compute C−1/2, we first must find the eigenvectors of C, and construct an
array P whose column vectors are these eigenvectors. Given that C is symmetric
and positive deterministic, it can be diagonalized as D = P−1CP whose diagonal
elements are eigenvalues of C. Therefore, C−1/2 = P
(
D1/2
)−1
P−1.
• It is recommended to use the eigenvalues to construct the diagonal matrix D,
instead of obtaining D using matrix multiplication, i.e.,, D = P−1CP. This
is simply because of the limited precision of computers so that after a series of
computations, the number zero is expressed in terms of a small number such as
1.1E-11, but after a number of iterations, this number may accumulate, increase
and eventually destroy the computation.
209
• Because the termination criteria mentioned above, the last generation is not nec-
essarily the best. As a result, after terminating the loop, the program reads the
entire output file and selects the generation with the minimum fitness value as the
final best result.
A.5 Optimization Results
A.5.1 Testing Program
Instead of using an existing code, we wrote our own code because the objective
function evaluation cannot be performed separately from the optimization code. The
code is written in interactive data language (IDL) 8.0 Mac version and run on a Mac Pro
with two 2.66 GHz Dual-Core Intel Xeon processors and 2 GB 667 MHz memory. Before
using the code to fit the quasar spectrum, we perform a series of tests by optimizing the
generalized Rosenbrock function (Rosenbrock 1960):
f(x) =
n−1
∑
i=1
[
100
(
x2i − xi+1
)2
+ (xi − 1)2
]
The global minimum of this function occurs when each xi equals 1 yielding f(x) = 0.
The global minimum is inside a long, narrow parabolic-shaped flat valley. This function
is widely used as a test function because to find the valley is trivial but to converge to
the global minimum is difficult, e.g., Storn & Price (1997). The goal of this test is to
prove that this code is working and achieve the desired performance. We terminate the
generation loop when the function values decrease below 10−10. We perform three tests.
In the first test, we fix the number of variables n = 2 while change the population size
λ = 10, 20, 50, 100. The evolution curves (Figure A.2) indicate that the code is working
and as the population size becomes larger, the results converge faster.
In the second test, we fix the population size at 50 and change the number of
variables N = 2, 5, 10, 15. The evolution curves are presented in Figure A.3. Again,
these curves indicate that the code is working well up to N = 15, which is above the size
of the quasar spectrum fitting problem (N = 11). The number of generations requested
to converge increases with problem size.
In the final test, we fix both population size λ = 50 and DOF N = 10, and run
the code 100 times. We want to determine (1) whether the function can converge to
the same value every run; (2) if it can, the distribution of the number of generations it
needs to converge (Figure A.3). We find that the objective function is below 10−10 and
|xi − 1| < 10−3 for all the runs. The distribution resembles a Gaussian with a median of
247 (Figure A.4), and a dispersion of ∼ 20. Only 3 runs need more than 300 generations.
The three tests verifies that the code is working well for the Rosenbrock function
optimization problem up to N = 15 with acceptable reliability. In the following sections,
we use this program to fit the quasar spectrum.
210
A.5.2 Results in Default Setup
In the default setup, we fix the population size λ = 220 and the number of
selected offspring µ = 110. The initial values of the free parameters are, in general, of
the same order of magnitude as the typical values (but not exactly the fitting results
using other methods). The optimization process terminates at the 72nd generation.
The values of basic parameter are presented in Table A.2. The fitting results in the
default setups are presented in Figure A.5. The optimal parameters we obtained are
presented and compared with previous results using LMA in Table A.3. Comparing with
the fitting result in Figure A.1, we find a significant improvement around the emission
lines between 2500 Å and 3000 Å. Another evident improvement is the region around
3600 Å and 3700 Å. The LMA overproduces the flux around this wavelength range but
the CMA-ES produces a much better fit. However, the CMA-ES over-produces the PL
continuum between 4500 Å and 5000 Å. In order to fit the broad bump (contributed
by iron emission) around 4500 Å, the overall scale factor of the optical iron template is
large so that the total flux beyond 5000 Å is over-produced. However, in general, the
CMA-ES algorithm produces a good balance between all the emission components and
the overall quality is indeed improved comparing with LMA method.
A.5.3 Varying Parameters
In this section, we compare the performance of CMA-ES on this particular prob-
lem by changing population size λ and number of offspring µ. First, we fix the proportion
of selected offspring with respect to the entire population, which is 50%, but change the
population size. The evolutionary curves are shown in Figure A.6 and the number of
generations for each population size is listed in Table A.4.
The population size changes from 55 to 440 as the color changes from red to blue.
We can see that neither the red nor the blue curve has the best performance. The red
curve, which represents the case λ = 55, converges to the optimal values at t ∼ 110 but
it is not the fastest option. The blue curve, which represents λ = 440, actually does not
converge to the optimal value; it bounces back at generation 100, returns at generation
170, and then remains around f = 110. It even exhibits a gradual increase after t ∼ 170.
The curve that shows the fastest convergence represents the case λ = 330, which is 30
times the total number of free parameters.
Next, we fix the population size λ = 22, but change the proportion of selected
offspring. The evolutionary curves are shown in Figure A.7 and the number of generation
for each proportion is listed in Table A.5. The color changes from red to blue as the
proportion increases from 1/10 to 1/1.5. From Figure A.7, we do not see a significant
difference among these cases, although the case in which µ/λ = 1/3 converges the fastest
with the minimum number of generations (64).
Finally, we test the reliability of CMA-ES on the quasar spectrum fitting problem
by running the program under the default setups (λ = 220, µ = 110) 100 times. The
distribution of the number of generations the evolution terminates is represented in
Figure A.8. This figure illustrates that the in general the CMA-ES algorithm is reliable;
about 60% of runs converge to the optimal value.
211
A.6 Conclusion and Discussion
The CMA-ES method has achieved a preliminary success in the continuum fitting
problem of a typical composite quasar spectrum. In the best case, it can finish fitting
a spectrum in about 1 minute under the default setups. Although this is about 5 times
longer than the LMA algorithm, it is still within the acceptable time scale. The most
important aspect is that the overall fitting quality is significantly improved and the op-
timal results do not depend on the initial parameters. It is then feasible to extend its
application to more quasar spectra and more complicated cases.
The real case can be more complicated. For instance, an iron emission template
(either UV or optical) can be subdivided into a number of sections and each section
may have a different scale factor. For some objects, a single PL is not enough and we
usually need to include another PL at λ > 5600 Å (if covered). Because of effective
exposure time, spectra may have different signal-to-noise ratio. All of these factors may
complicate the fitting process. Although the task in this work is simplified, the spectrum
we are using for the test is representative of the entire sample.
The fact that the theoretical reduced χ2 value (χ2 ∼ 1) is not reached is proved
not because of the algorithm but the model used the fit the spectrum. A single power-law
may not be accurate description to the overall spectral profile. The iron emission shape
may vary with different quasars, so a single iron emission template may not be exact.
The emission lines can also contribute some flux at the benchmark wavelength points so
it may not correct to only count the contribution from the continuum at these wavelength
points. Another issue is the non-uniformity of the benchmark wavelength points. When
selecting these wavelength points, we were trying to use as many constraints as possible.
However, because the benchmark points must avoid emission lines and there is a region
in which the iron emission template is not available (between 3000 Å and 3500 Å), these
benchmark points are not uniformly distributed; this could affect the evaluation.
Despite these limitations, the CMA-ES produces us a limit we can reach under the
best fitting model we can provide. It provides an acceptable fitting of a quasar spectrum
in a timely manner. Based on these results, we can further fit the emission lines seen in
the spectra.

log lλ(2200 Å) = 42.00. The original spectrum is shown in black. The x-axis is rest-frame
wavelengths in angstroms (Å) and the y-axis is flux density in 10−17 erg s−1 cm−2 Å−1.
The green curve is the underlying continuum fit using the LMA; the dashed magenta

Fig. A.2 Testing results of Rosenbrock function by varying population size using CMA-
ES. The colors of curves change from red to blue as the population size changes from 10
to 100. We fix degree of freedom (DOF) as 2. It is clear that a smaller population takes
much more generations to converge than a large population.
214
Fig. A.3 Testing results of Rosenbrock function by varying DOF. The colors of curves
change from red to blue as the DOF decreases from 15 to 2. We fix the population size
as λ = 50. It is clear that an evolutionary process with a higher DOF converges much
more slowly than an evolutionary process with a lower DOF.

with λ = 330 converges the fastest.

Software Design & User Manual for QSFIT
B.1 Introduction
The SDSS Quasar Spectral Fitting Software Package (QSFIT) is designed to fit
a typical quasar spectrum in the rest-frame UV and/or optical band. The wavelength
coverage of an observed SDSS quasar spectrum is 3700 Å-9200 Å; the spectral resolution
is ∼ 2000. The continuum of the spectrum can be fit with two power-laws (PLs),
intersecting at ∼ 5600 Å. The spectrum between Lyα (∼ 1216 Å) and ∼ 5600 Å is called
UV part; the wavelength longer than ∼ 5600 Å is denoted as the optical part. The
power-law can be represented as
fλ = 10
βλα (B.1)
in which α is called spectral index while β is called spectral coefficient or scale factor.
B.1.1 Software Availability
The user is always recommended to use the most recent version of this
software package. Due to historical reasons, the software parts are not assembled
as a single compressed file. Users must copy/download necessary programs from the
designated directories/urls.
• Install IDL 5.5 or newer version.
• Copy IDL astro library and add it to your IDL path: http://idlastro.gsfc.
nasa.gov/.
• Copy the IDL application collection:
nprmac.astro.psu.edu:~jxw394/idl/app/ and add it to your IDL path.
• Copy the UV iron template collection:
nprmac.astro.psu.edu:~jxw394/research/sdss/project/composite/data/FeTempl VC/.
You are recommended to copy this folder to a separate directory. You will need to
specify this directory in qconfit.par or qconfita.par.
• Copy the optical iron template collection:
nprmac.astro.psu.edu: jxw394/research/sdss/project/composite/data/Veron2004 VC/.
Again, you are recommended to copy this folder to a separate directory. You will
need to specify this directory in qconfit.par or qconfita.par.
• Copy the whole continuum and emission line fitting package:
nprmac.astro.psu.edu: jxw394/research/sdss/project/qsfit/. This folder contains
226
all the programs, parameter, input files and list files needed for this software pack-
age. After copying, rename the folder wgm/ as a name the user wants, which is
related to the project of the user, and empty all the sub-folders, e.g., bicheck out/.
Some folders are used for the user to save input/parameter files, others are used
to save programming running results.
B.1.2 Convention
We strongly recommend the user keep the conventional extensions defined in
the original software package, although the input spectral files are allowed to have any
extension. For example, the output of qconfita.pro is always named as .tmp. These
extensions are used to distinguish files input/output for different procedures/functions.
Changing these extensions may cause the program to malfunction.
B.1.3 Copyright and Maintenance
This software is designed, written, and maintained by Jian Wu (Department of
Astronomy and Astrophysics, Pennsylvania State University). All rights reserved. The

• Input/List/Parameter files (*.in, *.par, *.list). The package adopts a special for-
mat of parameter files (*.par) and input files (*.in). A parameter file contains
adjustable parameters used in a corresponding program in which each parameter
has a single possible value. An input file contains adjustable parameters used in a
corresponding program in which each parameter has multiple possible values. All
the *.par files use the same format and so do the *.in files. The program used to
read the *.par files and *.in files are readpar.pro and readin.pro. Both formats are
within the IDL application collection.
– A parameter file (.par file) contains four columns separated by semicolons.
Empty lines are not permitted in .par files.
1. Parameter value. Scientific notion supported.
2. Parameter type. We support four types: int, flt, dbl and str. For
example, a directory name is of type str. All directories must end
with a slash “/”.
3. Parameter name used in program.
4. Notes/Explanation of a parameter. Space permitted.
230
– An input file (*.in) contains
1. Quasar spectra. These could be original SDSS quasar spectra or composite
quasar spectra. They should contain three columns separated by space. Col-
umn 1 is the wavelength; Column 2 is the flux density fλ; Column 3 is the
uncertainty in fλ. These spectra can be placed in a folder but you need to
specify the folder in the parameter files of fitting programs (see below).
2. bicheck.par. Parameter file for bicheck.pro.
3. nod.list. A list of wavelength windows for PL estimation; used by bicheck.pro.
This file has three columns, separated by hyphens (“-”). In each row, the first
number is the starting wavelength of the window; the second number is the
ending wavelength of the window; the third number is the decrease factor.
This is a default wavelength window list. If you cannot achieve a good fit
using the default window and decrease factors, you can write a nod file for a
specific quasar (see the next item).
4. [qsoname].nod. The same as nod.list except that it is designed for a particular
quasar. bicheck.pro first searches for this file. If it does not exist, bicheck.pro
uses the general nod file nod.list. It is recommended that you use the “qson-
ame” which is part of the original spectrum. For example, if the original
spectrum is named as “Mrk727.dat”, this file should be “Mrk727.nod”, and
put it into a special directory designated in bicheck.par (see § 1).
5. line.in. A list of UV and optical emission lines appearing in a quasar spectrum,
used by several programs. This file has two columns separated by space. The
first column is the name of species producing an emission line, e.g., , CIII,
NIII], Ly1. Lyman and Balmer series are expressed in numerical numbers
rather than Greek letters, so Ly1 stands for Lyα. The second column is the
central vacuum rest-frame wavelength of the emission line in angstroms.
6. benchmark.list. A list of wavelengths at which the original and the model
spectra are compared. It contains only one column.
B.3 User Manual
Fitting a quasar spectrum can be divided into three major steps: estimating the
power-law, continuum joint fit, and emission line fit. Currently, these three steps can
only be run separately.
B.3.1 Power-law Estimation
The major programs to run this step are bicheck.pro and bicheckplot.pro. Before
running these codes, a few initial setups are required on the .par and .in files. Most
parameters do not need any change. Some information needs be changed only one time,
e.g.,, file path. In the context below, we define the working directory as the same
directory where you run the code.
1. Editing bicheck.par. This file must be copied to the working directory.
231
• bpoint - no need to change.
• nodfile - no need to change, but you must copy this file to working directory.
• dirin - change. This is the directory where you put all the rest-frame quasar
spectra you need to fit.
• dirnod - change. This is the directory where you put the wavelength window
files for specific quasars. It is recommended to be a sub-directory of dirin
named nod.
• outfile - no need to change. This is the output file of bicheck.pro. This file has
a header and contains 14 columns, with one row per spectrum. The meaning
of each column is given in Table B.1.
Table B.1 Columns in bicheck.pro output file.
Header Explanation
SPECFILE Original quasar spectrum file name
PINDEX1 UV PL spectral index
PINDEX2 Optical PL spectral index
PCOEFF1 UV PL spectral coefficient
PCOEFF2 Optical PL spectral coefficient
BPOINT Wavelength point where the two PL intersects
NOD1 0 Left wavelength of UV window 1
NOD1 1 Right wavelength of UV window 1
NOD1 2 Left wavelength of UV window 2
NOD1 3 Right wavelength of UV window 2
NOD2 0 Left wavelength of Optical window 1
NOD2 1 Right wavelength of Optical window 1
NOD2 2 Left wavelength of Optical window 2
NOD2 3 Right wavelength of Optical window 2
• dfact - no need to change. Decremental factor by default.
• smf - may change. Smooth factor by default.
2. Editing bicheck.list. This is the input quasar spectrum list by default. It has two
columns, the first column is a flag, there are typically 3 flag values (Table B.2) You
need to flag the spectra you want to fit with “r”.
3. Run bicheck.pro. There is a parameter and a keyword to run the program (Ta-
ble B.3). This program is run as below:
IDL> bicheck[,file][,/auto]
4. You should immediately check the output file (bicheck.tmp.out by default) after
running and rename it as necessary. This program will not remind you if this file

exists. It will simply overwrite the file. If you want to write a postscript (PS) plot
of the original spectrum with the PL fit into a file, we recommend renaming it as
bicheck.out because it is the default input file of bicheckplot.pro.
5. Edit bicheckplot.par. There are only two parameters in this file.
• dirin - Change. This is the directory where you put all the rest-frame quasar
spectra you need to fit.
• dirout - no need to change. The figures will be plotted into a single file and
written into this directory. By default dirout is the current directory but you
can certainly change it.
6. Run bicheckplot.pro. There is only one keyword - FILE. It is optional and has a
default value of bicheck.out. This should be the output file by bicheck.pro. However,
because the default file of bicheck.pro is bicheck.tmp.out, you may need to rename
that file to bicheck.out. The user can specify an alternative name as long as it was
output by bicheck.pro. The program is run as
IDL> bicheckplot[ ,file=file]
There are two output files produced by this program
• bicheckplot.ps - the original quasar spectra overplot with the estimated PL,
one spectrum per page.
• [qsoname].noc - PL continuum subtracted spectra written in dirin as specified
in bicheckplot.par. This file will be used to estimate the iron template scaling
factor.
233
B.3.2 Continuum Join-Fit
The major code to run for this step is qconfit.pro and qconfita.pro. The former
is for manual fitting and the latter is for automatic fitting. Because of the complexity
of the manual operations, this section only covers the automatic fitting at this moment.
As before, some initial setups need to be done before we run qconfita.pro.
1. Edit qconfita.par. This parameter file consists many parameters.
• indir - Change. This is the directory where you put all the rest-frame quasar
spectra you need to fit.
• outdir - no need to change. This is the output directory and is the current
directory by default.
• pardir - no need to change. Directory for [qsoname].par.
• infiledir - no need to change. Directory for [qsoname].in.
• uvdir - Change. The UV iron template directory.
• opdir - Change. The optical iron template directory.
• bicheckout - no need to change. The output file of bicheck.pro. Note that
you must rename this output file as bicheck.out (the original file name is
bicheck.tmp.out).
• f unit - no need to change. Scale factor for the flux density of the SDSS
spectra. It is 10−17 by default.
• bmfile - no need to change. A file containing benchmark wavelengths where
the original and the model spectra are compared.
• smf - May change. Smooth factor by default. This default smooth factor is
suitable for composite spectra. For real SDSS spectra, you may need a higher
value.
• snlim - May change. Limit of signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio. Flux pixels are
discarded if the S/N ratio is below this value. You may need another value
depending on your spectral quality.
• woffset - May change. Wavelength offset with respect to a benchmark wave-
length. Pixel fluxes between (benchmark−woffset,benchmark+woffset) are
evaluated (see bmfile).
• tnm uv - no need to change. Prefix of UV iron template files.
• norm uv - no need to change. This is a universal normalization factor of UV
iron template. Another factor will be multiplied to obtain the real flux level
of the iron emission.
• norm op - no need to change. This is a universal normalization factor of
optical iron template. Another factor will be multiplied to obtain the real
flux level of the iron emission.
• pidx uv - no need to change. PL index αUV at UV band (fλ = 10βλαUV). This
is a default spectral index if qconfita.pro cannot find the output of bicheck.pro.
234
• pscl uv - no need to change. PL coefficient β at UV band (see pidx uv).
• pidx op - no need to change. This is a default spectral index αop in optical
band if qconfita.pro cannot find the output of bicheck.pro.
• pscl op - no need to change. This is a default spectral coefficient β in optical
band if qconfita.pro cannot find the output of bicheck.pro.
• fix pidx uv - May change. Set to 1 if you want to fix the PL index at UV
band (either from bicheckout or the default value), otherwise, set it to 0.
• fix pscl uv - May change. Set to 1 if you want to fix the PL coefficient at
UV band (either from bicheckout or the default value), otherwise, set it to 0.
• fix pidx op - May change. Set to 1 if you want to fix the PL index at optical
band (either from bicheckout or the default value), otherwise, set it to 0.
• fix pscl op - May change. Set to 1 if you want to fix the PL coefficient at
optical band (either from bicheckout or the default value), otherwise, set it to
0.
• z uv - no need to change. Initial redshift offset of UV iron template.
• fix z uv - May change. Set to 1 to fix z uv and 0 to fit it.
• z op - no need to change. Initial redshift offset of optical template.
• fix z op - May change. Set to 1 to fix z op or 0 to fit it.
• v uv - no need to change. Initial velocity dispersion of UV iron template.
• fix v uv - May change. Set to 1 to fix v uv or 0 to fit it.

• bscl - no need to change. Initial scaling factor of small blue bump.
• fix bscl - May change. Set to 1 to fix bscl or 0 to fit it.
• c4200 - no need to change. An imperial adjustment factor at the 4200 Å
benchmark wavelength.
If you want a .par file for a particular quasar spectrum, you can create a copy
of qconfita.par and modify, and rename it. It is strongly recommended that you
save the renamed .par file in the directory designated by pardir. The program will
preferentially use this parameter file. If it does not exist, it will use the default
one.
2. Edit qconfita.in.
• trange uv - no need to change. UV iron template wavelength range.
235
• trange op - no need to change. Optical iron template wavelength range.
• wdiv uv - no need to change. Empirical dividing wavelengths of UV iron
template.
• wdiv op - no need to change. Empirical dividing wavelengths of optical iron
template.
• vval uv - no need to change. Possible velocity dispersion values for UV iron
template.
• vval op - no need to change. Possible velocity dispersion values for optical
iron template.
Similarly to the .par file, you can make a copy of qconfita.in, modify it and save
it in the directory designated by infiledir. The program will preferentially use this
parameter file. If it does not exist, it will use the default one.
3. Edit qconfita.list. The meanings of flags are the same as bicheck.list.
4. Run qconfita.pro or qconfitaloop.pro. To run a single spectrum, use the former;
to run a number of spectra in a loop, use the latter. The running command
qconfita.pro contains one parameter and two keywords (Table B.4). The commands
Table B.4 Parameters and keywords in qconfita.pro.
Name Property Option Default Explanation
specfile parameter mandatory original quasar spectrum file
plotg keyword optional 0 Set to 1 to launch window display
or else figures are plot into a PS file
replace keyword optional 0 Set to 1 to overwrite the existed result file
to run these two programs are
IDL> qconfita, specfile[ ,/plotg][ ,/replace]
IDL> qconfitaloop
For each spectrum, the continuum fitting results are written into a file named
[qsoname].tmp. If plotg is not set, a figure containing the underlying continuum
component over the original spectrum is plotted into a file named [qsoname].ps.
5. Checking the results. The result file of qconfita.pro may contain multiple rows,
each of them corresponds to one combination of velocity dispersions for the iron
templates in UV and optical bands. Currently, we have not found an effective way
to find the proper value of velocity dispersion for the iron templates. As a result,
we plot and print all the results out for a visual inspection.
236
Alternatively, the user can simply fix the velocity dispersion of UV or optical
template to be 3000 km s−1 if the sample size is so big that a visual inspection is
impossible to implement. This is an empirical “typical” or “average” value. It may
not apply to every spectrum, but should be a reasonable value for most quasars.
6. Run qconsyn.pro and qconsynplot.pro. The former program is used to synthesize
and plot the continuum spectrum output by qconfita.pro. Before running this pro-
gram, the user must edit qconsyn.par and qconsyn.in. These two files are imported
from qconfita.par and qconfita.in, respectively, so most of the parameters have
the same values. The only parameter to possibly change is tmpdir, which is the
directory of spectrum parameter files. The command to run qconsyn.pro has one
parameter and three keywords (see Table B.5). You must also edit qconsynplot.list,
which has the same format as qconfita.list. The program qconsyn.pro can only deal
Table B.5 Parameters and keywords in qconsyn.pro.
Name Property Option Default Explanation
specfile parameter mandatory original quasar spectrum file
psplot keyword optional 0 Set to 1 to plot figures into a PS file
or else plot figures in an IDL window
modelf keyword optional 0 Model flux.
(output) modelf[0,*] - total continuum
modelf[1,*] - PL continuum
modelf[2,*] - Small blue bump
modelf[3,*] - UV iron emission
modelf[4,*] - optical iron emission
tmpdir keyword optional 0 Same as tmpdir in qconsyn.par
Just in case of difference from default value
with a single spectrum; it is invoked by qconsynplot.list to run a number of spectra.
IDL> .compile qconsynplot.pro
IDL> .go
The output files are [qsoname].noc, which is the continuum subtracted spectra
(ready for emission line fitting), and [qsoname syn].ps, which is the underlying
continuum over the original quasar spectrum. Note that [qsoname].noc is different
from the files output by bicheckplot.pro. By default the outputs by bicheckplot.pro
are placed into the same directory as the original spectra while the outputs by
qconsyn.pro are written into the current directory.
237
B.3.3 Emission Lines Fitting
Emission lines are fit using either of the two codes: mlfit.pro and vmlfit.pro.
They fit emission lines in a similar way except that they create different outputs. The
program mlfit.pro writes line parameters for one quasar spectrum into one file, while
vmlfit.pro writes line parameters of an emission line for all quasar spectra into one file.
We recommend using vmlfit.pro other than mlfit.pro. We introduce how to run
mlfit.pro first.
1. Edit mlfit.par. This file has only two parameters.
• dir rst - Directory where you put all the rest-frame quasar spectra you need
to fit.
• dir noc - Underlying continuum-subtracted spectrum directory.
2. Edit mlfit.in. This input file is different from traditional input files described above.
It is especially designed for mlfit.pro or vmlfit.pro. Each column is described below:
(a) Flags - Change. Two possible values: + or −. A + means including this line
in fitting queue while a − means not fitting this line.
(b) Line ID number - no need to change. Line sequence number adopted from
line.in,
(c) Emission line rest-frame wavelength in angstroms - no need to change.
(d) Emission line fitting window left boundary - may change. If you want to
group several adjacent lines and let them be fit simultaneously, you must use
the same value for this parameter.
(e) Emission line fitting window right boundary - may change. If you want
adjacent lines to be fit simultaneously, you must use the same value for this
parameter.
(f) Number of Gaussian profiles needed to fit the emission line - may change.
(g) Left boundary of a single Gaussian profile range - may change. This specifies
the wavelength range of a single line even if it is blended with other transitions.
The code will fit the spectrum within this wavelength range so as to determine
the Gaussian σ of the line profile. If multiple Gaussian profiles are needed,
this sigma will be used as the one of the narrowest component.
(h) Right boundary of a single Gaussian profile range - may change.
(i) Continuum choice - may change. This specifies which type of continuum is
used; “mc” means global continuum while “lc” means local continuum.
3. Setup the mask files and are named as [qsoname].mask These files are used in
mlfit.pro if the user wants to mask certain wavelength ranges when fitting the
emission lines. The spectrum may show strong associated absorption features that
may lead to underestimations of emission line fluxes. This file can contain as many
lines as needed. It contains only two columns delimited by hyphens (“-”).
4. Run mlfit.pro. The command has one parameter and one keyword.
238
• qsolist - mandatory. Spectrum file name without the suffix. For example, if
the spectrum file name is Mrk766.dat, this parameter should be Mrk766.
• auto - optional. This program has two modes. If auto is set, it runs all the
lines in a spectrum; otherwise, it is in the manual mode. In this mode, you
can select and fit a specific emission line. If an emission line is grouped with
other emission lines, all the lines in this group will be fit.
The command to run is
IDL> mlfit, qsoname[, /auto]
The steps to run vmlfit.pro are similar to that to run mlfit.pro.
1. Edit vmlfit.par. This is the default setup file for all emission lines, but if you need
a parameter file for a certain emission line different from the default one, you can
create a similar file called [linename].vml.par. The program will search for this file
first. If it does not exist, the default parameter file is used. Here, [linename] is a
name of an emission line after removing the “irregular” characters. For example,
the semi-forbidden line name CIII]1908 is renamed as CIII1908.
• filterpass - may change. The smaller it is, the less the high frequency com-
ponent (noise) there is.
• dir noc - change. The directory of underlying continuum-subtracted spectra.
• file - may change. A file containing a list of spectra names whose emission
lines are to be fit. This file has three columns, separated by spaces. The
first column is a flag. Differently from previous list files, spectrum files
marked with an “x” is going to be run. The second column is the
numbers of quasar spectra. The third column is the name of quasar spectra
without suffix. For example, if the spectrum file name is Mrk766.dat, this
name should be Mrk766.
• sufnoc - may change. The suffix of the continuum-subtracted spectra. Of
course, it is .noc by default.
• dir ori - change. Directory of the original quasar spectra.
• sufori - may change. Suffix of the original spectra, e.g., .dat.
2. Edit vmlfit.in. This is the same as mlfit.in.
3. The outputs of this program include four types of files.
• vmlfit.[linename].log. This is the log file recording the run status of this pro-
gram.
• vmlfit.[linename].gss. Parameters for Gaussian profiles of the best fit. The
first line is the title for each column. Here, a Gaussian profile takes the form
g(λ) = g0e
−(λ−λ0)
2/2σ2 (B.2)
There are eight columns in this file (Table B.6).

• vmlfit.[linename].par. There are ten columns in this file (see Table B.7).
• [linename].vml.ps This file contains four panels.
(a) The first plot is the region of the original spectrum around the desired
emission line.
(b) The panel to the right of the first one is the global continuum subtracted
spectrum around the desired emission line.
(c) The panel below the first one shows the global continuum subtracted
spectrum with the “low pass band filter” signal (in blue). If the local
continuum fit is required, it will also display the shape of this local con-
tinuum.
(d) The last panel displays the emission line fit in blue. The dotted lines are
Gaussian components and the dot-dashed lines are the boundary within
which the emission line fitting is performed.
By now, both of the continuum and emission line fittings are completed.

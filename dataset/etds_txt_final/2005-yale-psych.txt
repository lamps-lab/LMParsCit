Abstract
Attentional Capture in Specific Phobia 
Mariann Rose Weierich 
2005
This work examines the mechanistic role of attentional processing of threat­
relevant visual stimuli in specific phobia using the theoretical framework of attentional 
capture. The attentional capture approach distinguishes between the facilitated orienting 
of attention to and difficulty disengaging attention from threat, and is associated with 
experimental paradigms that offer a nuanced examination of attentional processing in 
anxiety. In addition, most prior work in attentional processing in anxiety has focused on 
the spatial allocation of attention; the temporal allocation of attention in anxiety has been 
under-studied, although it also may underlie symptom onset and maintenance. The cue 
validity and rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) paradigms can measure orienting and 
disengagement of attention using circumscribed phobia-relevant stimuli.
Experiment 1 examined the spatial allocation of attention in spider phobia using 
the cue validity paradigm. Consistent with hypotheses and recent work examining the 
capture of attention in anxiety, there was no evidence for facilitated spatial orienting of 
attention to phobic stimuli, although spider-phobic participants did exhibit difficulty with 
spatial disengagement from phobic stimuli. Experiment 3 examined the temporal 
mechanisms of attentional processing in spider phobia using the RSVP paradigm 
modified to address the limitations of Experiment 2. Consistent with hypotheses, the 
preliminary results suggest that phobic participants, relative to controls, experience 
facilitated temporal orienting of attention to phobic stimuli, in addition to more difficulty 
with temporal disengagement from threat-relevant stimuli. Both studies also eliminate 
negative valence of the stimuli as an explanation for the results. The results suggest that

specific phobia is characterized by enhanced perception of and difficulty disengaging 
from threat-stimuli within the immediate visual field, whereas preferential spatial 
orienting of attention may require more top-down processing.
The current work provides evidence that these basic attentional paradigms can be 
translated for the examination of the role of potentially problematic mechanisms of 
attentional processing in clinical anxiety. In turn, improved mechanistic models of 
anxiety disorders may lead to the development of more effective or efficient behavioral 
interventions.

Attentional Capture in Specific Phobia 1 
Overview
Attention to threat-relevant information is implicated widely in the etiology and 
maintenance of the anxiety response (e.g., Mathews, 1990). The present work represents 
the translation of the attentional capture model for the examination of the mechanisms of 
attentional processing of threat-relevant information in specific phobia. The question of 
interest is whether anxiety disorders are characterized by facilitated orienting of attention 
to threat, difficulty disengaging attention from threat, or a combination of both attentional 
mechanisms. A better understanding of the nature of attentional processing in anxiety 
disorders will enhance mechanistic models of anxiety, which in turn can explain 
symptom onset and maintenance, as well as inform interventions. Specific phobia is an 
anxiety disorder that is particularly well-suited for this initial translation of basic visual 
paradigms for the study of attention in anxiety; threat-relevant stimuli largely are visual 
and circumscribed, and the fear response is specific to the phobic stimulus, rather than to 
internal cues, as in panic disorder, or to stimuli that are less homogenous across patients, 
as in PTSD. I therefore chose specific phobic as the disorder of interest for this initial 
examination of the mechanisms of attentional processing in anxiety.
Most of the prior work examining attentional processing in anxiety and other 
psychological disorders has been based on the attentional “bias” construct (c.f., Mineka, 
Rafaeli, & Yovel, 2002), but this theoretical model does not distinguish between the 
subcomponents of attentional processing. In addition, most research that examines the 
role of attention in anxiety focuses on spatial allocation of attention, or the notion that 
anxious individuals scan their environment for threat. Measurement of spatial allocation 
of attention has been limited largely to the dot-probe paradigm, although recent work has

utilized a more contemporary task, the cue validity paradigm. The first of the present 
studies extends the literature in attention and anxiety by addressing the subcomponents of 
attentional processing in specific phobia utilizing the cue validity paradigm.
Spatial processing alone may not completely account for the attentional 
difficulties in anxiety; attention to anxiety-relevant information in its physical absence 
(e.g., continued attention to a mental representation of a spider after the spider is removed 
from the room) also might create significant difficulty for individuals with anxiety 
disorders. However, the temporal allocation of attention has been under-studied, and 
research to date has not examined the temporal allocation of attention in clinical anxiety. 
The second and third studies presented here are the first to employ the rapid serial visual 
presentation (RSVP) paradigm with photo stimuli for the examination of the temporal 
allocation of attention in individuals with an anxiety disorder.
Specific Phobia
A brief overview of specific phobia further supports the selection of this disorder 
as ideal for the present investigation of the attentional mechanisms underlying anxiety 
disorders. Specific phobia is defined by the DSM-IV as a “marked and persistent fear that 
is excessive or unreasonable, cued by the presence or anticipation of a specific object or 
situation” (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). Additional required criteria are that 
the individual must (1) experience the fear nearly every time he or she encounters the 
phobic stimulus; (2) recognize that the fear is unreasonable or excessive; (3) avoid the 
situation or endure exposure to it with extreme distress; (4) experience significant 
impairment in functioning or significant distress about having the phobia; and (5) have

had the problem for at least 6 months in the absence of another DSM-IV disorder that 
better accounts for the symptoms. Specific phobias are categorized into five types: animal 
type (e.g., snake, spider), natural environment type (e.g., bodies of water), blood- 
injection-injury type (e.g., shots), situational type (e.g., public transportation), and 
“other” type (e.g., vomiting, clowns). The current work focuses on snake and spider 
animal type phobias as common examples of specific phobias. The point prevalence for 
snake and spider phobias has been estimated at 5.5% and 3.5%, respectively (Fredrikson, 
Annas, Fischer, & Wik, 1996).
Across phobia types, the most common response to exposure to the feared object 
or situation is a panic attack, or a panic-like reaction, that includes a rush of fear, 
followed by a rapid heartbeat or pounding in the chest, muscle tension, shortness of 
breath or rapid breathing, and an urge to flee (Thyer & Himle, 1987). Unlike individuals 
with other anxiety disorders, such as social phobia or panic disorder, individuals with 
specific phobia do not report anxiety about the experience of the physical symptoms of 
anxiety (i.e. anxiety sensitivity) (Taylor, Koch, McNally, & Crockett, 1992). That is, the 
phobic stimulus elicits a severe anxiety response that is particular to that external 
stimulus, rather than the experience of an aversive internal state (i.e., the physiological 
experience of anxiety). The initial translation of cognitive theory and measurement for 
the examination of attentional processing in anxiety disorders requires a disorder with 
such clear-cut characteristics.

Theoretical Models of Attention and Anxiety 
Most broad theoretical models of anxiety implicate attention to threat-relevant 
information in the etiology and maintenance of disorder (Mathews, 1990; Mathews & 
MacLeod, 1994; Mogg & Bradley, 2003; Williams, Watts, MacLeod, & Mathews, 1988). 
Individuals with anxiety disorders, including specific phobia, generally are thought to 
attend preferentially to threat-relevant information (e.g., Wenzel & Holt, 1999). Because 
this behavior appears to result in increased distress, the role of attention as a potentially 
causal or maintaining factor for symptoms has become the focus of a large body of 
research. For example, associative network models of fear and anxiety posit systems of 
concepts stored as “nodes” in memory (Bower, 1981; Foa & Kozak, 1986; Lang, 1979). 
Each node is connected to related nodes such that the mental representation of a feared 
object or situation is associated with related representations (e.g., “snake” is linked to 
“slimy”, “striped”, “coil”, etc.). The activation of one node upon the perception of a 
threat-relevant cue can activate the associated nodes in any direction, such that the 
activation of “coil” upon seeing a garden hose, for example, can activate “snake” and 
provoke a fear response in an individual with snake phobia. The networks o f linked nodes 
can become very elaborate and the strength of association between nodes can become 
quite strong in fear situations and in anxiety disorders. Attention, voluntary or not, 
naturally is required to activate a concept and its associated nodes. The basic question of 
interest, therefore, is whether there is something special about the role of attention in 
anxiety disorders such as specific phobia. Do individuals with anxiety disorders attend 
differently to stimuli that are assumed to activate their fear networks? The behavioral 
literature supports the notion of differential attentional processing in anxiety (e.g,

MacLeod & Mathews, 1988; Mathews & MacLeod, 1994; Mogg & Bradley, 2003; 
Ohman & Mineka, 2001; Teachman & Woody, 2003, Williams, Mathews, & MacLeod,
1996). In addition, recent evidence from neuroscience suggests that attentional 
processing in anxiety may include reduced cognitive control over the processing of 
threat-relevant information (cf. Bishop, Duncan, Brett, & Lawrence, 2004).
In phobia, converging evidence from recognition memory studies also suggests 
that phobics exhibit poorer memory for peripheral objects when a phobic stimulus is 
present (Wessel & Merckelbach, 1998). Phobic subjects may experience narrowed 
attentional processing of threat-relevant stimuli that significantly impairs concurrent 
attentional processing of other environmental information. It appears clear that 
something is different about attentional processing in anxiety. Less clear is the precise 
nature of the differences in attentional processing between anxious and non-anxious 
individuals -  do individuals with clinical anxiety orient attention preferentially toward 
threat, or do they have more difficulty disengaging from threat, once it is attended?
“Attention” Defined 
Before further discussing the theory and research on the role of attention in 
specific phobia, it is necessary to specify a definition of attention. One erroneous, yet 
common, assumption made by researchers is that each mention of attention refers to the 
same construct (c.fi, Styles, 1997). This assumption fosters a significant degree of 
confusion in the understanding of the theoretical models that implication “attention” and 
the comparison of findings about “attention” across studies. In fact, even vision scientists, 
whose work is the study of attention, have not reached a consensus definition (Styles,
1997). One major goal of researchers in experimental psychopathology is to translate

theoretical assumptions and measurement paradigms from basic vision science to the 
study of psychopathology. Thus, it is imperative to adopt a common working definition 
of attention in which to ground our investigations.
For the purpose of the study of attentional processing in anxiety, it seems 
reasonable to begin with the classic general definition provided by William James: 
"Everyone knows what attention is. It is the taking possession by the mind in clear and 
vivid form, of one out of what seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of 
thought...It implies withdrawal from some things in order to deal effectively with others" 
(1890). More precisely, visual attention can be defined as the processing capacity by 
which we select certain visual stimuli for further processing (Pashler, 1998; Scholl,
2001). This selection is subject to limited capacity, as we can attend only to a finite 
number of stimuli simultaneously. Additionally, this selection mechanism can require 
considerable effort. In anxiety, the notion is that attention preferentially selects threat­
relevant information for elaborated processing (Williams, Mathews, & MacLeod, 1996). 
Such selection can significantly limit the concurrent processing of other, potentially 
important, information. The degree of effort required to maintain attention to threat­
relevant information is part of the present question. It is possible that the effort involved 
in attentional processing of threat is invested in attempts to avoid the stimuli, but that this 
effort frequently is unsuccessful. The larger question is whether attentional processing of 
threat-relevant information in individuals with anxiety disorders is characterized by 
enhanced orienting of attention to threat, or by a relative difficulty with disengagement 
once threat information is attended.

Attentional Capture in Specific Phobia 7
In the service of the examination of the mechanisms of attentional processing in 
anxiety, it is useful to adopt a mechanistic model of attention that elaborates upon these 
questions. Posner’s (1980) three-step processing model of the shift of attention 
incorporates attentional subcomponents: attentional engagement, disengagement, and re­
engagement (orienting). That is, attention first is engaged with a location or object, as the 
reader’s attention currently is engaged with this page. Attention then must be released, or 
disengaged, from the attended object or location, in order to re-engage with (i.e., be 
oriented toward) a different location or object (Posner & Cohen, 1984). This cyclical 
model is particularly useful for outlining the mechanisms of attentional processing in 
anxiety; symptoms of anxiety may be caused or maintained by difficulty with 
disengagement from or enhanced orienting to anxiety-relevant information (e.g., Amir, 
Elias, Klumpp, & Przeworski, 2003; Fox, Russo, Bowles, & Dutton, 2001).
The theoretical model of attentional capture (Yantis & Jonides, 1984) takes into 
account the subcomponent processes of attention, and it fits well with Posner’s nuanced 
three-step model. This model suggests that the difficulties experienced by individuals 
with anxiety disorders, including specific phobia, are caused or maintained not only by an 
abnormal “bias toward”, or facilitated orienting of attention to, threat-relevant 
information, but also by difficulty disengaging from that information once it is perceived. 
This distinction is potentially important, as the mechanistic contribution of each 
processing subcomponent to anxiety symptoms might vary by anxiety disorder. For 
example, individuals with specific phobia might experience symptoms due to enhanced 
orienting of attention to their phobic objects, whereas individuals with GAD might 
experience symptoms due to difficulty disengaging from worry-relevant information once

it is attended. This distinction between subcomponents also is potentially clinically 
relevant; if  the difficulty is facilitated orienting of attention to threat, treatment can focus 
on reducing scanning or vigilance behaviors, for example. On the other hand, difficulty 
disengaging from the trigger stimulus might be addressed by helping patients to 
disengage more adaptively (i.e, faster).
Attentional Capture Approach 
As noted, the field has learned a tremendous amount from the attentional bias 
approach; however, both the theoretical approach of attentional bias and the related 
measurement models used for the study of the role of attention in anxiety may not 
adequately address the nature of attention in anxiety. The theoretical assumptions and 
experimental paradigms of contemporary vision science can be translated for the study of 
the influence of attentional processing in anxiety, and this alternate approach addresses 
the limitations of the prior models. The measurement paradigms developed for the study 
of attentional capture allow for the parsing of attentional processing into the 
subcomponents of orienting and disengagement of attention.
One necessary element of the argument that attentional processing may maintain 
anxiety symptoms is a clear understanding of whether problematic processing reflects 
preferential orienting of attention to threat or difficulty disengaging attention from threat 
cues once they are attended. In recent years, several pioneers have begun to adopt this 
approach (e.g. Amir, Elias, Klumpp, & Przeworski, 2003; Fox, Russo, Bowles, & Dutton, 
2001; Koster, Crombez, Verschuere, & DeHouwer, 2004), although a comprehensive 
discussion of the theoretical distinction does not yet exist in the clinical literature.

Theoretical Model: Attentional Capture 
The theoretical model of attentional capture (Yantis & Jonides, 1984) is a better 
fit than the bias model for the conceptualization of the role of attention in anxiety. 
Attentional capture occurs when attentional resources are drawn involuntarily by an 
environmental stimulus. For example, the abrupt onset of a stimulus tends to draw 
attention in a stimulus-driven manner, as does an object that flashes (Yantis & Jonides, 
1984; 1990). This capture of attention maybe involuntary and unconscious, yet not 
capacity-free, such that the individual may be less able concurrently to allocate attention 
to another stimulus or task in the presence of the attended stimulus (e.g., Folk, 
Remington, & Johnston, 1992; Theeuwes, 1991). One fundamental characteristic of the 
attentional capture construct is its allowance for the prioritization of potentially 
dangerous, or otherwise important stimuli, such that the capture of attentional resources 
by these stimuli is adaptive (e.g., Most, Scholl, Clifford, & Simons, 2005).
Evolutionarily, it makes sense that a poisonous snake captures attention, for example. In 
anxiety disorders, however, the range of objects or situations that are perceived as 
“dangerous” can be wider than is logical. For example, a coiled garden hose might 
capture the attention of an individual with snake phobia. This theoretical model of 
attentional capture, therefore, maps well onto the phenomenology of anxiety disorders 
such as specific phobia, in which attentional capture by phobic stimuli often precludes 
attention to other potentially important information.
Within the vision science literature, there often is debate as to whether the capture 
of attention under certain conditions reflects a perceptual effect or an attentional effect 
(e.g., Yantis & Jonides, 1984). The former implies that properties of the stimulus draw

attention, whereas the latter assumes that the implicit attentional goals of the individual, 
such as vigilance for threat, direct attention preferentially to certain objects or locations. 
In both cases, the allocation of attention is assumed to be relatively involuntary. For the 
current examination of attentional processing of threat in specific phobia, it seems likely 
that the top-down attentional goals of an individual with phobia interact with perceptual 
characteristics of feared animal (e.g., legs) to facilitate orienting of attention to threat. 
Disengagement from threat, on the other hand, may reflect a greater influence of 
attention, as features of an object are less likely in themselves to continue to hold 
attention (Yantis & Jonides, 1984). Whether due to the relative influence of top-down or 
of bottom-up processing, the capture of attention by threat-relevant stimuli represents a 
distressing problem for individuals with anxiety disorders.
Contemporary measurement paradigms for the attentional capture framework 
have been developed by visual-perception researchers, and it is possible to translate these 
paradigms for the study of the processing of visual threat information in anxiety. These 
tasks are designed to measure orienting and disengagement of attention, and they 
represent the state of art in the measurement of the subcomponents of visual perception.
Traditional Theoretical Approach: Attentional Bias 
The majority of research that incorporates an experimental approach to the study 
of anxiety disorders has been based on the theorized “attentional bias” for threat-related 
stimuli in the environment (MacLeod & Rutherford, 1998; MacLeod & Mathews, 1988; 
Mathews & MacLeod, 1985; McNally, 1999). The bias construct is incomplete with 
respect to the current conceptualizations of attention held by vision scientists, as it does

not discriminate between the subcomponents of attention. Anxious individuals may, on 
average, exhibit facilitated orienting of attention toward threat-relevant environmental 
stimuli to a greater extent than non-anxious individuals. An alternate possibility is that 
anxious and non-anxious individuals may attend, on average, equally efficiently to threat­
relevant stimuli, but anxious individuals may experience more difficulty disengaging 
their attention from threat once they have attended to it. The distinction is important, as 
the various anxiety disorders might differ depending on which subcomponents are 
problematic for each, and the development of appropriate behavioral treatments can be 
enhanced by a clearer understanding of attentional mechanisms. For example, facilitated 
orienting of attention to negative facial expressions might be prominent in social phobia, 
whereas difficulty with disengagement from trauma-relevant stimuli might represent the 
greater impediment in PTSD. Unlike the relatively broad attentional bias construct, the 
theoretical and measurement models of attentional capture fit the phenomenology of 
attention in anxiety (i.e., the theorized behavioral impairment associated with attention to 
threat), because they are able to address the distinction between the subcomponents of 
attention.
Measurement o f Attentional “Bias"
In the past two decades, numerous researchers in the field of experimental 
psychopathology have utilized performance-based paradigms to examine the role of the 
theorized attentional bias in anxiety (e.g. Mathews & MacLeod, 1985; McNally, 
Riemann, & Kim, 1990; Watts, McKenna, Sharrock, & Tresize, 1986). Their work 
largely has relied upon two measurement paradigms: the Stroop task and the dot-probe 
task.

Stroop Paradigm
The emotional Stroop paradigm is a commonly-used measure that attempts to 
discover whether threat-relevant stimuli interfere with concurrent task demands (e.g., 
MacLeod, 1991). In the Stroop task, subjects view words printed in different colors. The 
task is to name the colors rather than reading the words. The original Stroop effect was 
found with color names printed in different colors; subjects took longer to name the word 
color when the color name was incongruent with the print hue (Stroop, 1935). In other 
words, the word meaning interferes with color naming when the meaning is inconsistent 
with the color percept. In the anxiety literature, researchers commonly use a variant of the 
original design, the emotional Stroop task (MacLeod, 1991). Word stimuli in this design 
are chosen for their affective value for the population of interest. In studies of social 
phobia, for example, emotion words might include “embarrass”, or “awkward”.
In studies of anxiety using the emotional Stroop paradigm, anxious subjects are 
expected to take longer to name the color of anxiety-related words because those word 
meanings presumably draw attention more efficiently than neutral words. For both supra- 
and subliminal Stroop tasks, longer response times for color-naming of anxiety-related 
words compared to color-naming of neutral words are interpreted as greater attentional 
bias to the anxiety-relevant word stimuli. For example, a subject with OCD might show 
slower color-naming of obsession-related words compared to neutral words.
A variety of studies present evidence for Stroop interference in anxiety disorders 
(Williams, Mathews, & MacLeod, 1996). For example, studies have found interference 
effects of fear-relevant words for participants with specific phobia (Kindt & Brosschot, 
1997; Watts, McKenna, Sharrock, and Trezise, 1986), GAD (Mogg, Bradley, Williams,

& Mathews, 1993), social phobia (Mattia, Heimberg, & Hope, 1993), panic disorder 
(McNally, Riemann, & Kim, 1990), and PTSD (Paunovic, Lundh, & Oest, 2002). In 
addition, results from one version of the Stroop task using color-masked photo stimuli 
found enhanced interference of snake stimuli for snake-fearful subjects (Constantine, 
McNally, & Homig, 2001). When effects are found, they generally are reported as 
interference in anxious participants and the absence of such interference in control 
participants. However, several studies have failed to find Stroop interference effects for 
fear-relevant stimuli (e.g., Bryant & Harvey, 1995; Kindt & Brosschot, 1997; Mathews & 
Sebastian, 1993). In sum, Stroop results generally appear to support the existence of 
differential processing of threat-relevant information in anxiety. That is, it is fairly 
consistently found that anxious individuals experience some difficulty completing target 
tasks (i.e., color-naming) in the presence of anxiety-relevant stimuli. What is unclear is 
the mechanism underlying this relative difficulty.
Limitations o f Stroop paradigm
Although many Stroop results in studies of anxiety appear to suggest a unique 
role of attention in anxiety, clear interpretation of these results with respect to the 
orienting and disengagement subcomponents processes of attention is limited. The target 
and distractor stimuli are superimposed in this task, as target color and distractor word 
are properties of the same stimulus. It therefore is not possible to determine whether the 
interference effect reflects orienting of attention to threat words, or difficulty disengaging 
from them (Fox, Russo, Bowles, & Dutton, 2001). For example, if an individual with 
social phobia takes longer to name the colors o f social threat words compared to neutral 
words, this could reflect facilitated orienting of attention to social threat meaning,

difficulty disengaging attention from social threat meaning, or both. It follows that a clear 
understanding of the mechanistic role of attention in anxiety cannot be achieved using 
this task. In addition, target tasks and threat-relevant stimuli generally are not 
superimposed spatially in the real world; this characteristic of the Stroop task limits its 
ecological validity.
Dot-Probe/Attentional Probe Paradigm
The dot-probe, or attentional-probe, paradigm also has been used to measure 
attentional bias in anxiety (MacLeod, Mathews, & Tata, 1986; Mogg & Bradley, 2003). 
Participants view two stimuli, such as one neutral and one threat-relevant word, presented 
above and below fixation for 500 milliseconds (See Figure 1). Stimuli then offset, and a 
probe (e.g., dot) appears in the location of one of the stimuli. Participants respond by 
indicating the location of the probe. If a participant has been attending to the threat­
relevant stimulus, the response time for indicating the probe location in the threat position 
should be faster than the response time for the probe in the neutral stimulus location. It 
follows that faster response times to the threat location are interpreted as an attentional 
bias for threat.

fixation
Figure 1. Spatial measurement of attentional “bias”: Dot-probe paradigm. A faster response time 
to the target dot in the same position as the threat word than to the target dot in the same position 
as the neutral word is considered an index of attentional bias to threat.
This paradigm has been modified to address one concern regarding the nature of 
the probe detection. It is possible for a subject to detect the presence of a simple probe 
(e.g., dot) without shifting attention when the initial stimuli and the probe both are 
presented within foveal vision. That is, participants can detect the onset of the probe in 
the periphery while maintaining attention at the other cue location. The modified version 
of the task requires a discrimination task as the probe, such as the identification of one 
symbol versus another, rather than simple detection of an object onset, such as a dot 
(Bradley, Mogg, Falla, & Hamilton, 1998). Although participants can detect simple 
features of probes in the periphery, they must attend to the probe object in order to 
discriminate between possible responses.
Shorter response times to probes in the same position as anxiety-relevant stimuli 
compared to control stimuli have been found in participants with GAD (Bradley, Mogg, 
Millar, & White, 1995), social phobia (Mansell, Clark, Ehlers, & Chen, 1999; Musa, 
Lepine, Clark, & Mansell, 2003; Pishyar, Harris, & Menzies, 2004), panic disorder 
(Kroeze & van den Hout, 2000), and PTSD (Bryant & Harvey, 1997), compared to non­

anxious control participants. However, the one dot-probe study measuring attention in 
specific phobia failed to find an attentional bias toward threat information in spider or 
blood-injury phobia (Wenzel & Holt, 1999). That study used positive (e.g., cheer), 
negative (e.g., nausea), neutral (e.g. table), and threat-relevant (e.g., web, syringe) word 
stimuli, and the authors concluded that individuals with phobia might not show the effect 
when semantic processing is required. Again it appears that the published results 
generally support the existence of differential attentional processing in anxiety, and the 
researchers have largely interpreted the results as implicating preferentially oriented 
attention to threat. One exception to the interpretation of results as a “bias toward” threat 
is a recent paper that used the dot-probe paradigm to examine selective attention related 
to general threat photo stimuli in unselected participants (i.e, there was no assessment of 
participant anxiety) (Koster, Crombez, Verschuere, & DeHouwer, 2004). The authors 
found slower response times to probes in the opposite position from threat photos, such 
as those from the International Affective Photo System (IAPS), and they interpreted this 
result as difficulty with disengagement from threat. It is difficult to compare dot-probe 
study results due to the heterogeneity of populations studied and stimuli used, but the 
effects typically are reported in anxious participants but not in non-anxious participants 
(e.g., Yiend & Mathews, 2001). In some studies, the effect is reversed in low or non- 
anxious participants; these participants have faster response times to probes in the 
opposite location as threat stimuli compared to neutral or positive stimuli (e.g., Bradley, 
Mogg, & Millar, 2000; Ioannou, Mogg, & Bradley, 2004).
It appears clearer with the dot-probe paradigm than with the Stroop task that 
anxiety-relevant stimuli may differentially influence attention in individuals with anxiety

disorders. This increased level of consistency might reflect the superior construct validity 
of the dot-probe task compared with Stroop (Mineka, Rafaeli, & Yovel, 2002); because 
the distractor and target task are not superimposed, the task is more likely to tap actual 
shifts of attention. In effect, the results suggest that attentional processing in anxiety 
might be characterized by specific difficulties with disengagement or orienting, although, 
as discussed below, the dot-probe design cannot parse the two subcomponents of 
attention.
Limitations o f dot-probe paradigm
The addition of a target discrimination task has enhanced the interpretation of 
results; however, two major limitations to interpretation remain. First, as noted by several 
researchers (Bradley, Mogg, & Millar, 2000; Fox, Russo, Bowles, & Dutton, 2001), the 
commonly used 500 ms duration of the stimulus pair presentation is relatively long. It is 
possible to attend to one location and shift to the other within a 500 ms window, as the 
initial orienting response has been found both at 100 ms and 200 ms (e.g., Christie & 
Klein, 1995). It also is possible to attend to one location, shift to the other location, and 
then shift back within 500 ms (e.g, Fox et al., 2001). Therefore, it is not possible to 
determine whether the longer response times to probes in the non-threat location reflect 
facilitated attention to or difficulty disengaging from the threat-relevant stimuli, or both. 
Adding to the confusion is the conflicting language used by researchers to describe their 
results. As noted, although most authors of dot-probe studies present their data as 
evidence of attentional bias toward threat, one more recent paper nicely addresses the 
issue of orienting and disengagement and presents dot-probe results as evidence for the

latter (Koster, Crombez, Verschuere, & DeHouwer, 2004). In either case, the 500 ms 
stimulus presentation time precludes accurate interpretation.
Second, both threat-relevant and neutral stimuli are presented simultaneously 
within a participant’s minimum visual field around fixation; one cannot know where 
subjects are attending (Fox, Russo, Bowles, & Dutton, 2001). Participants cannot help 
but attend to both stimuli initially; therefore, measurement of initial biased allocation of 
attention to threat-related information is not possible.
General Measurement Issue: Stimulus Considerations 
There are two common problems with stimulus sets used in many prior studies 
that utilize the Stroop and dot-probe paradigms to assess the role of attention in anxiety. 
First, the stimuli developed by cognitive researchers to study basic visual attention do not 
correspond well to the stimuli encountered in the world. Although this is preferable in 
basic research that examines visual processing, the measurement of attentional processing 
in individuals with psychological disorders, such as specific phobia, requires stimuli that 
more closely approximate the triggers that lead to distress. Tasks that rely upon word 
stimuli, therefore, often are less relevant for this population, as, for example, an 
individual with spider phobia rarely sees the word “spider” appear in her kitchen. That is, 
one general assumption about attentional processing in anxiety is that anxiety-relevant 
trigger stimuli in the world often are percepts, such as a frown on someone’s face to a 
social phobic, or a smudge of dirt to someone with OCD. Although interpretation, or 
semantic processing, of stimuli such as words also may be problematic for individuals 
with anxiety disorders, the study of basic attentional processing is concerned with the 
detection of perceptual information. A caveat: it also might be the case that word stimuli

are the optimal choice for the examination of the role of attentional processing in some 
anxiety disorders. For example, in GAD, the content of worry may be more conceptual 
and semantic than perceptual, such that word stimuli are most appropriate.
A related advantage of the use of snake and spider phobias for the examination of 
attentional processing in anxiety is that, whereas the range of trigger stimuli for various 
anxiety disorders often includes cues related to other sensory modalities, the triggers in 
specific phobias often are purely visual. For example, auditory cues, such as the sound of 
a person laughing, might be a trigger for a patient with social phobia; and olfactory cues 
such as the smell of a rapist’s brand of cologne might trigger PTSD symptoms for a rape 
victim. Snakes and spiders, however, generally are perceived visually; they are detected 
less often by scent or sound, with the notable exception of the distinctive sound of 
rattlesnakes. It follows that the examination of the mechanisms of visual attentional 
processing is particularly relevant for this type of anxiety disorder, and that photos are the 
optimal experimental stimuli for use in attentional paradigms.
The second common limitation of most prior stimuli is that inattention to stimulus 
valence and emotionality issues often clouds the interpretation of results (c.f. Ruiz- 
Caballero & Bermudez, 1997). Researchers frequently compare threat-relevant stimuli to 
neutral stimuli and/or positive stimuli without including negative, non-threat stimuli, for 
example. Thus, the results may represent subjects’ sensitivity to negative valence rather 
than anxiety relevance. Results also may be due to preferential processing of general 
emotionality, rather than threat-relevance (Mathews & Klug, 1993). That is, researchers 
sometimes attribute effects to the negative valence of stimuli when the effect may be due 
to general (positive or negative) degree of emotional arousal. The present work continues

the current trend toward the use of photo stimuli to more closely approximate the real- 
world experience of threat-relevant stimuli, and also includes the proper controls for 
valence and emotionality.
Summary o f Attentional Bias Approach 
Based on the evidence from the extensive attentional bias research, it appears 
likely that there is something special about the role of attentional processing in anxiety. 
Differential attentional processing of threat-relevant information appears to be associated 
with anxiety (Mineka, Rafaeli, & Yovel, 2002). However, we cannot determine the 
precise nature of the attentional differences, as the methods based on the relatively vague 
bias construct cannot disambiguate the subcomponent processes of attention. It follows 
that our understanding of the mechanistic role of attentional processing is limited. 
Research can be better served by a more contemporary approach that addresses this 
significant shortcoming. The theoretical and measurement models of attentional capture 
serve such goals. Measurement paradigms also should address the stimulus 
considerations that have been overlooked in the prior use of attentional paradigms.
Temporal/spatial allocation o f attention 
One additional theoretical distinction is relevant to the model of attentional 
capture in anxiety. Attention can be allocated spatially or temporally, and the relative 
influence of these aspects of problematic attentional processing in anxiety should be 
included in mechanistic models of symptom onset and maintenance. Spatial allocation of 
attention refers to the shift of attention from one location in space to another. Tasks that 
require individuals to search among items in a display, for example, are spatial tasks. 
Generally, the theorized bias in anxiety has been thought to result from spatial vigilance

(e.g., Ioannou, Mogg, & Bradley, 2004; Ohman, Flykt, & Esteves, 2001), or constant 
scanning of the immediate environment for threat. For example, a person with spider 
phobia might have her attention drawn along the baseboards of a room upon entering, or 
an individual with social anxiety might scan faces at a party for perceived critical 
expressions. Accordingly, measurement of the attentional bias construct largely has relied 
upon spatial paradigms. As discussed earlier, the two most commonly used measures of 
attentional “bias” in anxiety are the emotional Stroop and dot-probe paradigms. It is 
unclear whether the emotional Stroop paradigm measures spatial or temporal allocation 
of attention, as both target (color) and distractor (word meaning) are properties of the 
same stimulus, so it is not possible to determine the cause of the interference. The dot- 
probe task was designed for the spatial measurement of attentional bias. Individuals are 
required to attend to one location or another on the screen, and they also may need to re­
allocate attention to another spatial location during a trial. In addition, several measures 
of attentional capture address spatial allocation of attention; the visual search paradigm 
and the Posner cue validity paradigm recently have been used to provide more precise 
measurement of the subcomponents of spatial attention (e.g., Amir, Elias, Klumpp, & 
Przeworski, 2003; Fox, Russo, Bowles, & Dutton, 2001; Ohman, Flykt, & Esteves, 2001, 
Yiend & Mathews, 2001). Overall, a considerable literature addresses spatial allocation 
of attention in anxiety and has found differential processing in anxiety. Further, evidence 
for both spatial orienting of attention (e.g., Ohman et al., 2001) and difficulty with spatial 
disengagement (e.g., Amir et al., 2003; Fox et al., 2001) in anxiety has been found using 
measurement paradigms developed from the attentional capture perspective. The 
temporal and spatial aspects of attentional allocation provide multiple ways to measure

the construct, in much the same way as multi-method measurement (e.g., self-report and 
behavioral observation) is preferred in clinical research. It follows that the examination of 
the allocation of attention can be optimized by the measurement of both dimensions.
Spatial and Temporal Allocation o f  Attention in Anxiety 
As noted, most experimental paradigms used to study attention and anxiety 
measure spatial processing; the temporal allocation of attention has been under-studied in 
anxiety. Temporal allocation of attention refers to the distribution of attention over time, 
or how long an individual attends to one stimulus, or stimulus representation, without 
redirecting attention to another stimulus in the same location. Although most feared 
stimuli do not appear or disappear suddenly, there are instances in which the temporal 
allocation of attention is likely to present difficulties for persons with anxiety disorders. 
For example, a glimpse of a snake on television might capture the attention of a snake 
phobic, even when the image is presented very briefly or the channel is changed.
Although the threat-relevant cue then would be replaced temporally by non-threat 
material in the same spatial location, the individual with snake phobia might nonetheless 
continue to process the trigger stimulus, which could lead to symptom onset or 
exacerbation.
The measurement of both temporal and spatial allocation of attention is important 
for the understanding of the mechanisms of attentional processing in anxiety, as well as 
for the development of effective behavioral interventions that can be tailored to the 
various disorders. Recent work in attentional retraining for the purpose of reducing 
anxiety (e.g., Rutherford, MacLeod, & Campbell, 2002) highlights the need for treatment 
paradigms that correspond to the targeted problematic processing. Thus, for example,

someone with GAD might benefit more from temporal retraining of attention that leads to 
decreased difficulty with temporal disengagement from worry-relevant information. 
Parsing the relative influence of the temporal and spatial dimensions of attention in 
anxiety may be particularly valuable for the tailoring of treatments.
It may be that the relative influence of temporal and spatial mechanisms of 
attention varies by disorder. For example, a person with GAD may be less likely to scan 
her environment and thereby have her attention captured spatially, although the same 
person may be quite likely to experience difficulty disengaging from anxiety-relevant 
information over time, which might precipitate or maintain worry. It also is possible that 
both spatial and temporal difficulties with allocation of attention are implicated in 
symptom onset and maintenance in some disorders. A social phobic, for example, might 
have her attention drawn spatially to “unfriendly” faces at a social gathering, and also be 
unable to disengage temporally from the perceived negative information when the 
“unfriendly” expressions are replaced by welcoming smiles. In specific phobia, it makes 
sense that phobic individuals might experience difficulty disengaging spatially and 
temporally from phobic stimuli.
Spatial Measurement o f Attentional Capture: the Cue Validity Paradigm 
The cue validity paradigm (Posner, Snyder, & Davidson, 1980) measures 
primarily spatial allocation of attention. This paradigm presents only one stimulus at a 
time, correcting one difficulty with interpretation of the dot-probe paradigm. Participants 
initially fixate on a central point on the screen. A single cue stimulus is presented to the 
right or left of fixation, unlike in the dot-probe paradigm, wherein two stimuli are 
presented simultaneously. The cue offsets, and the target stimulus appears in either the

cued (valid) or the non-cued (invalid) location (see Figures 2 & 3). In the following 
experiment, the target was one of two possible symbols, and reaction time for symbol 
discrimination was the dependent measure. The cueing paradigm allows examination of 
the efficiency of orienting attention to an object, and the efficiency of disengaging 
attention from an object. For valid cue trials, the speed of target discrimination reflects 
the speed with which attention is oriented to the cue object. For example, Christie and 
Klein (1995) found that target discrimination on valid trials was faster when the cue was 
a common word versus when the cue was a non-word. Such modulation of attentional 
orienting as a function of cue meaning was observed at cue-target stimulus onset 
asynchronies (SOAs) of 100 ms and 200 ms. For invalid cue trials, the speed of symbol 
discrimination reflects the efficiency of disengaging attention from the cued location and 
re-orienting it to the target location.

they must disengage from the cue position and shift attention to the opposite location.
One essential parameter, cue validity, ensures sustained attention to the cued 
location; the target appears in the valid location (i.e., the same position as the cue) most 
(75%) of the time. That is, the high probability of a target in the cue location trains 
subjects to attend preferentially to the cued location. This contingency results in the basic 
cueing effect, which is the mean response time to the invalid (uncued) location minus the 
mean response time to the valid (cued) location. The cueing effect typically is a positive 
value. Attending to the cued location on invalid trials results in longer response times to 
the target, as participants must disengage their attention from the cued location to attend 
to the target. As discussed earlier with the dot-probe paradigm, a useful modification of 
the task requires participants to perform a discrimination task following the onset o f the 
target stimulus. For example, the target might be one of two symbols (e.g., “%” and 
“&”), and participants must identify the symbol. This ensures subjects’ allocation of 
attention to the target rather than simple detection of a featural change in the periphery.

Attentional Capture in Specific Phobia 26
As noted, response times for the target discrimination are faster after valid cues 
than after invalid cues. That is, when participants direct their attention to the cue prior to 
the presentation of a target, they take additional time to disengage from the cue to re­
allocate attention to a target in the other location. For anxious participants, response times 
after a phobic cue object should be slower than those of control subjects if  difficulty with 
disengagement from threat-relevant stimuli exists. Therefore, for example, if  the cue is a 
negative socially-relevant stimulus, subjects with social phobia should take longer to shift 
attention to the true target location in the invalid condition due to a relative difficulty 
with disengagement from the anxiety-relevant stimulus.
The cueing paradigm has been used to examine difficulty with disengagement in 
sub-clinical anxiety (Fox, Russo, Bowles, & Dutton, 2001). High trait-anxious subjects 
showed longer response times for detecting targets following invalid angry face cues than 
did controls. Similar findings were reported for general threat pictures, such that high 
trait-anxious individuals showed greater difficulty disengaging from threatening 
photographs relative to non-anxious controls (Yiend & Mathews, 2001). A third set of 
studies reported greater difficulty in disengaging from emotional face stimuli (angry or 
happy) for high trait-anxious subjects compared to low-anxious subjects (Fox, Russo, & 
Dutton, 2002). The one recent study with clinical anxiety found difficulty with 
disengagement from threat-relevant stimuli in social phobia (Amir, Elias, Klumpp, & 
Przeworski, 2003).
The cueing paradigm also provides a measure of enhanced orienting of attention 
to threat-relevant target stimuli. At very short stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs), or the 
time between cue onset and target onset (e.g., 100 ms to 200 ms), faster response times to

threat-relevant stimuli compared to neutral stimuli in the valid (cued) location reflect 
faster orienting to threat (Christie & Klein, 1995). One study did not find differences in 
orienting attention to threatening stimuli between high and low trait anxious subjects at a 
150 ms SOA (Fox, Russo, Bowles, & Dutton, 2001). This result was consistent with their 
hypothesis that anxious individuals would not show enhanced orienting to anxiety­
relevant information compared to non-anxious individuals. Spatial attentional capture by 
abrupt onset (i.e., onset of cue) should not vary by diagnostic group. That is, anxious and 
non-anxious individuals presumably detect low-level features of objects, such as color or 
shape, equally efficiently. The results support the notion that the difficulty for anxious 
individuals instead may lie with disengagement from threat-relevant information.
The cueing paradigm clearly is capable of measuring differences in attentional 
processing with respect to emotional stimuli. As is true with the dot-probe paradigm, 
careful consideration of stimulus presentation times is essential to the design. On valid 
cue trials, cue-target SOAs that are too long allow enough time for the subject to shift 
attention to the cue on all trials, obscuring differences in the efficiency of orienting. As 
noted above, the optimal timing parameters for an initial orienting response should be in 
the range of 100-200 ms SOA, as used by Fox et al. (2001) and Christie and Klein 
(1995). For assessment of disengagement, a longer cue-target SOA is required to ensure 
that participants have had opportunity to shift attention to the cued location prior to target 
appearance; the cued location must be reliably attended to examine the efficiency of 
disengaging attention from that location. Fox et al. (2001) successfully used a 300 ms 
cue-target SOA to examine efficiency of disengagement.

The present experiment was divided into two sub-experiments. Both included 
valid and invalid cue trials. In the attentional orienting sub-experiment, cue-target SOA 
was set at 120 ms to examine initial shifts of attention, and response times following 
valid cues were of central interest. In the attentional disengagement sub-experiment, the 
cue-target SOA was set at 300 ms to ensure that participants had attended to the cue 
object prior to the appearance of the target object, and response times following invalid 
cues were of central interest.
Experiment 1
The aim of Experiment 1 was to examine the role of the subcomponents of the 
spatial allocation of attention in specific phobia using the cue validity paradigm. Photo 
stimuli were used to enhance the ecological validity of the findings. Additionally, 
negative, non-threat stimuli were included, which allowed differentiation between 
attentional processing of threat-relevant information and negatively valenced 
information. Consistent with the basic vision literature (e.g., Christie & Klein, 1995), and 
the results of recent studies that examined the subcomponents of attentional processing in 
subclinical anxiety (e.g., Fox et al., 2001) and social phobia (e.g., Amir et al., 2003) using 
spatial paradigms, I hypothesized that (1) spider-fearful participants would not show 
faster orientation of attention to phobia-related stimuli compared to other stimulus types 
and compared to control participants, and (2) spider-fearful participants would experience 
difficulty with disengagement of attention from phobia-related stimuli compared to other 
stimulus types and compared to control participants. This pattern would indicate that 
phobic status is not one of the parameters that influences the efficiency of spatial 
orienting of attention to a stimulus. But, once attended and identified, phobic status may

affect the dwell time of attention, with phobic participants attending to threat-relevant 
stimuli longer before they can orient their attention spatially elsewhere. On the other 
hand, phobic individuals are likely to experience difficulty disengaging spatially from 
phobia-relevant stimuli once they have been attended. This maps onto behavior in the 
world; a spider phobic is unlikely to let a spider out of her sight lest it approach her, for 
example.
Method
Participants
Participants were 12 spider-fearful and 12 non-fearful controls who were recruited 
from the University of Iowa undergraduate introductory psychology subject pool. 
Potential participants were pre-screened for eligibility using a subset of questions from 
the Snake Anxiety Questionnaire (SNAQ) (Klorman, Weerts, Hastings, Melamed, & 
Lang, 1974), and the Fear of Spiders Questionnaire (FSQ) (Szymanski & O’Donohue, 
1995) (see Appendix A for Experiment 1 pre-screen items). The pre-screening procedure 
limited the number of questionnaire items, therefore the entire measures could not be 
used. I used score cutoffs that corresponded to full-measure means that were found to be 
consistent with high animal fear in prior studies (Constantine, McNally, & Homig, 2001; 
Klorman, Weerts, Hastings, Melamed, & Lang, 1974; Muris & Merckelbach, 1996; 
Teachman & Woody, 2003). Accordingly, eligible spider-fearful participants scored high 
on the 15 FSQ items (i.e., at least 75 of 90 possible points) and low on the 15 SNAQ 
items (i.e., 3 or fewer of 15 possible points). Two pre-screened spider-fearful male 
participants were excluded from the analysis due to their non-fearful questionnaire

responses (i.e., FSQ scores in non-phobic range) after session one. Non-fearful control 
participants scored low on both pre-screening measures of animal fear (i.e., 15 or fewer 
points on the FSQ and 3 or fewer points on the SNAQ). Study participants were primarily 
female and White (see Table 1). Participants were compensated with course credit for the 
two separate 60-minute experimental sessions.

Procedure
Sessions
Each participant completed two sub-experiments in two sessions. In one session, 
the speed of orienting attention toward phobic, negative, and neutral stimuli was 
assessed. In the other block, the speed of disengaging attention from phobic, negative, 
and neutral stimuli was assessed. Participants completed the full battery of self-report 
questionnaires after the first session, and they repeated the state version of the State-Trait 
Anxiety Inventory after the second session. The state anxiety measure provided an 
assessment of participants’ level of anxiety immediately following the experiment. 
Experimental session order (i.e., orienting or disengagement) was counterbalanced by 
participant.
Overview o f  Cue Validity paradigm
For both the orienting and disengagement sub-experiments, participants were 
seated in a comfortable chair at a viewing distance of 70cm from the monitor.
Participants read the task instructions on the computer screen (see Appendix C for 
complete task instructions). The following events constituted an experimental trial. 
Participants viewed a blank screen with a central fixation marker for 1000 ms. Next, a 
photo cue stimulus appeared to the left or the right of fixation for 80 ms (orienting 
blocks) or 260 ms (disengagement blocks); these presentation times are described in more 
detail within the block descriptions. The cue then offset, followed by a 40 ms blank to 
prevent masking of the cue by a target. The target letter appeared either in the same 
location as the cue (valid trials, see Figure 2) or the opposite location as the cue (invalid 
trials, see Figure 3). Participants then identified the target letter (i.e., “X” or “O”) as

quickly as possible by pressing one of two buttons on a response box. Participants 
received feedback on the accuracy of their responses; “correct” or “incorrect” appeared 
on the screen following each response. During the experiment, a research assistant 
monitored participants’ eye movements from fixation. The research assistant flagged 
trials during which participants made saccadic eye movements, and these trials were 
excluded from the analyses.
The target appeared in the same location as the cue in 75% of the trials, thus 
providing participants with a strong incentive to attend to the cued location. Participant 
demonstration of a baseline cueing effect (i.e., longer response time to targets in the 
invalid location compared to the valid location) is a necessary condition for examining 
modulation of attentional shifts within the cueing paradigm. Orienting to and difficulty 
disengaging from threat-relevant stimuli were measured by presenting photos o f spiders 
(threat-relevant), snakes (negative, non-threat) and frogs (neutral) in the cue position, and 
using two different cue presentation times (see block-specific descriptions). Each cue 
type appeared equally often, and cue order was randomized by the computer program. 
The animal stimuli were color photos of spiders, snakes, and frogs that were removed 
from their backgrounds to control for possible effects of background features (see 
Appendix B for sample stimuli). The stimulus set consisted of 12 photos of each animal 
type, for a total of 36 photo stimuli. All stimuli were approximately 6cm wide and 6cm 
high, and the edges of the photos closest to center were presented approximately 6cm to 
the right or left of fixation. Target stimuli were the letters “X” and “O”. The experiment 
was presented on a dark gray screen. The cue validity paradigm was programmed using 
E-Prime software (Schneider, Eschman, & Zuccolotto, 2002a; 2002b).

Orienting session
Participants completed 604 orienting trials of the cueing paradigm. The first 28 
trials were practice trials, for which response time data were not analyzed. 432 (75%) of 
the remaining 576 test trials were valid (i.e., the target appeared in the same position as 
the cue). The invalid trials allow us to determine the existence of a baseline cueing effect. 
As noted, this baseline cueing effect is a necessary condition for testing the modulation of 
cueing by group and stimulus type. For measurement of orienting of attention, I used a 
120 ms SOA (see Figure 4). The dependent variable for the orienting session was the 
mean reaction time for correct target identification on validly cued trials. Although data 
from invalid trials were important for the establishment of a baseline cueing effect, the 
variable of interest was reaction time to the cued location. Faster reaction times to threat­
relevant cues (spider) compared to neutral (frog), or negative, non-threat (snake) cues 
provide an index of orienting of attention to those threat cues.

Disengagement session
Participants completed 604 disengagement trials, of which the first 28 were 
practice trials. Of the test trials, 144 (25%) were invalid (cue in opposite position from 
target). The majority of the cues were valid, which gave participants an incentive to keep

attention focused on the cue location as predictive of target position, and allowed 
measurement of a cueing effect. For the session measuring disengagement of attention, I 
used a 300ms SOA (see Figure 5). This timing allows participants time to orient attention 
to the cue, but does not allow shifting of attention from the cue prior to target onset (Fox, 
Russo, Bowles, & Dutton, 2001; Theeuwes, Godijn, & Pratt, 2004). The dependent 
variable for this block was the cueing effect, or the mean reaction times on invalidly cued 
trials minus the mean reaction times on validly cued trials for each stimulus type.
Because participants must disengage their attention from the cued location to identify the 
target in the invalid location, the cueing effect should be a positive value, as response 
times to targets in the uncued location should be longer than response times to the cued 
location.

In addition to the basic cueing effect, I computed an index of difficulty with 
disengagement from threat-relevant cues that controlled for the basic cueing effect by 
subtracting the cueing effect for neutral (frog) stimuli from the cueing effect for threat 
(spider) stimuli. Similarly, I computed an index of difficulty with disengagement from

threat-relevant cues that controlled for negative valence by subtracting the cueing effect 
for negative, non-threat (snake) stimuli from the cueing effect for threat stimuli. This 
index allows differentiation of difficulty disengaging from phobic stimuli beyond 
difficulty disengaging from negatively-valenced stimuli.
Questionnaire measures
At the end of the first experimental session, participants completed a battery of 
self-report measures that included the Fear of Spiders Questionnaire (FSQ) (Szymanski 
& O’Donohue, 1995), the Snake Anxiety Questionnaire (SNAQ) (Klorman, Weerts, 
Hastings, Melamed, & Lang, 1974), Fear Questionnaire (FQ) items relevant to snake and 
spider fear (Marks & Mathews, 1979), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory -  State version 
(STAI-S) (Spielberger, Gorsuch, & Lushene, 1970), and the Beck Depression Inventory- 
II (BDI-II) minus the suicidality item (Beck, Steer, & Brown, 1996). IRB approval 
necessitated omission of the suicidality item, as the research assistants who assisted in 
data collection were not qualified to assess suicidal ideation should a participant endorse 
that item.
The FSQ is a commonly-used 18-item questionnaire for which responses are 
given on a 7pt scale. Items tap two dimensions of the phobic response: avoidance/help- 
seeking (e.g., “If I came across a spider now, I would leave the room”) and fear of harm 
(e.g., “If I saw a spider now, I would be very afraid of it”). The FSQ has been found to 
have good psychometric properties; it has been shown to have test-retest reliability of .97, 
and it is internally consistent (Cronbach’s a = .92).
The SNAQ (Klorman et al., 1974) is a commonly used 30-item True/False 
measure of snake fear that includes items such as “I am terrified by the thought of

touching a harmless snake”. The SNAQ has a reported test-retest reliability o f .75 
(Klorman et al., 1974).
The selected Fear Questionnaire items measure self-reported avoidance of snakes 
and spiders using a single rating for each on a 9pt scale, as well as a subjective rating of 
the present state of phobic symptoms on a 9pt scale. The FQ has been shown to 
discriminate between phobics and non-phobics, and it has good reported test-retest 
reliability for individual phobia items (r =.93) and global phobia severity rating (r =.79) 
(Marks & Mathews, 1978). The authors do not report internal consistency, as the foil 
measure contains single items specific to particular fears, rather than multiple items 
related to particular fears.

Questionnaire Data
A one-way ANOVA with group as the factor and questionnaire scores as 
dependent variables revealed that spider-fearfol participants had significantly higher 
scores on the FSQ, F(l,20)=256.86,/K.001; the FQ spider fear item, F(l,20)=79.31,

p<.01, compared to controls (see Table 2). Spider-fearfol participants also scored 
significantly higher than control participants on the SNAQ, F(l,20)=6.97, j?<.05; and the 
FQ snake-fear item, F(l,20)=5.73,/><.05. There were no significant differences between 
groups on the BDI-II, F(l,20)=3.13,/?=092.

Response time data trimming
Reaction time data for both blocks were trimmed to eliminate outliers. Trials with 
reaction times that were less than 175ms or greater than 2000ms were not included in the 
analysis. This trim procedure is a standard, conservative method of excluding response 
time outliers, and this procedure eliminated 3% of trials. Trials during which participants 
made saccadic eye movements from fixation also were excluded, which eliminated just 
under 3% of trials.

Orienting
The baseline cueing effect was observed; participants showed longer response 
times on invalid trials (M=450.32) than on valid trials (M=432.04). Demonstration of a 
baseline cueing effect is a necessary condition for examining modulation o f attentional 
shifts within the cueing paradigm. All participants showed a valid cueing effect in the 
orienting session, thus, the data from all participants contributed to the analysis of group 
and stimulus effects.
Response time data from the valid trials were analyzed to determine the speed of 
orienting of attention to the three stimulus types; the orienting effect is the response time 
to target stimuli that appear in the same position as the cue. A two-way mixed model 
ANOVA was conducted with group as the between-subjects factor, stimulus type as a 
within-subjects factor, and reaction time as the dependent variable. There was no 
significant main effect of group, F ( \ ,  20) = .171,/?=.683, rjp2 = .008; spider-fearful and 
control participants did not differ in reaction times to targets in the same position as the 
cue (see Table 3 and Figure 6). There also was no significant main effect of stimulus 
type, Wilk’s A= .94, F  (2,19) = .623,/?=.547, r)p2= .06, and the interaction between 
group and stimulus type was not significant, Wilk’s A= .996, F (2,19) = .037, p=.963, rjp2 
= .004. Spider-fearful and non-fearful control participants did not appear to attend 
differentially to the stimulus types on valid trials. The effect size for the interaction was 
quite small (i.e., less than 1% of the variance), which suggests that the absence of 
significant differences is not attributable to Type II error.

Disengagement
The basic cueing effect was observed in the disengagement session for all but four 
participants. Disengagement data were excluded for 2 control participants and 2 spider- 
fearful participants due to negative cueing effects (i.e., faster reaction times following 
invalid cues than valid cues for two or more stimulus types). It is unclear why the 
negative cueing effect occurred for some participants, but their data cannot be used to 
examine the modulation of disengagement, as they do not show a reliable baseline cueing 
effect. For the remaining 10 control participants and 8 spider-phobic participants, 
response times were faster in the valid condition than in the invalid condition; these data 
contributed to the analysis of group and stimulus effects.
A two-way mixed model ANOVA with group as a between subjects factor and 
stimulus type as a within subject factor revealed no significant group differences in the 
magnitude of the cueing effect, F  (1, 16) = .278,/>=.605, pp2 =.017 (see Table 4 for 
means). There was a significant main effect of stimulus type, Wilk’s A= .499, F  (2,15) =

A= .518, F(2,15) = 6.99, p<.01, pp = .482. Follow-up paired samples t-tests showed no 
significant within-subjects differences between stimulus types for control participants,

these participants took significantly longer to disengage from spider stimuli (M=26.69,

One of the aims of the present study was to examine the cueing effect for threat stimuli 
independently of the basic cueing effect or the cueing effect for negatively valenced 
stimuli. I controlled for the basic cueing effect by subtracting the frog (neutral) cueing 
effect from the spider cueing effect, and controlled for negative valence by subtracting 
the snake (negative) cueing effect from the spider cueing effect (see Figure 8).

Experiment 1 Discussion 
Consistent with prior research (Fox et al., 2001), I did not find evidence for 
facilitated orienting of attention to threat in spider-fearful participants compared to non­
fearful controls. There also was no evidence for within-subject enhanced orienting of 
attention to spider stimuli compared to negative or neutral stimuli. These preliminary 
results are inconsistent with theories of attentional “bias toward” threat-relevant 
information in anxiety disorders. I adjusted timing parameters to assess the orienting 
response within the 100ms to 200ms initial orienting window that has been stated in the 
literature (e.g., Christie & Klein, 1995; Fox, Russo, Bowles, & Dutton, 2001), which 
resulted in the accurate measurement of the orienting response to cue stimuli. It was 
hypothesized that there would be no group differences in the orienting of attention to the 
onset of cue stimuli, regardless of their phobia-relevant features (e.g., spider legs). This is 
consistent with a perceptual explanation of attentional capture; phobic stimuli did not 
differentially attract the attention of individuals with phobia, although these individuals 
presumably have implicit attentional goals that include detection of threat. These data 
also are consistent with the finding that, during free viewing of real-world scenes, 
semantically salient objects (e.g., a toaster in a bathroom) do not preferentially draw 
attention; although, once attended and identified, they are attended longer than 
semantically consistent objects (e.g., a hair dryer in a bathroom) (Henderson, Weeks, & 
Hollingworth, 1999).

Attentional Capture in Specific Phobia 44
The hypothesis for difficulty with spatial disengagement from phobia-relevant 
information was supported. Spider-fearful participants showed greater difficulty 
disengaging from spider stimuli compared to control participants, and they also showed 
greater difficulty disengaging from spider stimuli compared to negative or neutral stimuli. 
This also is consistent with recent research that utilizes this paradigm with sub-clinical 
anxiety (Fox et al., 2001; Yiend & Mathews, 2001), and social phobia (Amir, Elias, 
Klumpp, & Przeworski, 2003). Spider-fearful participants also had significantly greater 
difficulty disengaging from spider stimuli, controlling for the baseline cueing effect and 
the cueing effect for negative stimuli, compared to control participants. This finding 
supports the notion that individuals with specific phobia experience attentional capture by 
threat-relevant information that is greater than that of simply negative information. The 
evidence that potentially problematic attentional processing of anxiety disorder-relevant 
information is unique (i.e., beyond the effects of negative valence) supports the notion 
that there is something special about attentional processing in anxiety disorders. The 
present work provides evidence that non-anxious participants do not process negatively- 
valenced visual stimuli differently from neutral stimuli. On the other hand, phobic 
participants appear to process phobic stimuli differently than both negative, non-threat 
and neutral stimuli. The differential processing of negative valence supports the notion of 
that the processing of threat is unique in phobic individuals. Beyond that baseline level of 
visual processing of threat, phobic individuals’ attention appears to be held more 
strongly, and potentially problematically, by phobic stimuli. The evidence supports the 
notion that these participants may experience considerable difficulty disengaging their

attention from phobic stimuli, and suggests that interventions that retrain individuals to 
disengage more effectively may be useful clinically.
As discussed earlier, the spatial allocation of attention is only part of the potential 
pattern of attentional difficulties in anxiety disorders. Temporal allocation of attention 
also may present problems for individuals with anxiety disorders, including specific 
phobia. One of the aims of the present work is to provide converging evidence for 
differential attentional processing in the temporal domain.
Temporal Measurement o f Attentional Capture: the RSVP Paradigm
\\
Anxious individuals may experience involuntarily sustained temporal attention to 
threat-relevant stimuli that decreases their ability to attend to subsequent stimuli 
presented in the same visual field. Normal individuals exhibit a refractory period 
following identification of one stimulus, during which the individual is less able to 
allocate attention to another stimulus due to the capacity required for processing the first 
stimulus (e.g., Chun & Potter, 1995; Shapiro, Raymond, & Amell; 1994). This period of 
impaired performance is termed the attentional blink. The blink phenomenon can be 
measured using the RSVP paradigm.
In the original RSVP design, participants view a stream of rapidly presented black 
letters, within which is one white letter (first target) (see Figure 9). In half of the trials, a 
black “X” (second target) is presented in one of several positions within an 800ms 
window following the white letter. Participants’ task is to identify the white letter, and 
indicate whether the “X” was present in the stream. The time between a correctly 
identified white letter (Tl) and a correctly detected “X” (T2) for a given subject

represents the measure of the attentional blink, or difficulty disengaging attention from 
T l. The dependent variable is the percentage of correctly identified T2 stimuli, given a 
correctly identified T l, for each position after T l . For normal individuals, the duration of 
the blink (i.e., the period of relative difficulty with T2 identification) averages between 
two and five positions (200-500ms) following Tl (Shapiro, Raymond, & Amell, 1994). 
The position of a particular stimulus following Tl is termed a “lag” (e.g, the 1st stimulus 
after Tl is at “lag 1”).

Figure 9. Original design of attentional blink paradigm. Participants identify the white letter and 
indicate the presence or absence of the black X. The X is present at lag 3, and a failure to detect it 
in the given example would indicate an attentional blink of at least 300ms, if each stimulus was 
presented for 100ms.
The prototypical attentional blink curve reflects the percentage of correct T2 
identification at each lag (see Figure 10). The most pronounced period of impaired 
performance (i.e., lower percent correct detection of T2 given correctly identified T l) 
usually is found in the first few lags following T l . The exception to this performance 
deficit is at the first lag following T l, as performance is enhanced at this lag due to the 
ability of individuals to “bind” , or concurrently identify, the lag 1 stimulus with the 
identified Tl stimulus due to temporal proximity (Shapiro, Raymond, & Amell, 1994).

increases.
Attentional Blink: Disengagement
When the letter stimuli are replaced by anxiety-relevant stimuli, we expect a 
threat-relevant Tl to result in a larger blink for anxious subjects, as these individuals are 
likely to experience more difficulty disengaging from threat-relevant information (see 
Figure 11). When a threat-relevant stimulus (e.g., spider) appears in the Tl position 
among neutral distractors, individuals with high fear of spiders are expected to show 
worse T2 detection performance in the lags immediately following T l, as the threat­
relevant image should hold their attention more than a neutral T l .

animal and indicate the presence or absence of fruit. If phobic individuals have more difficulty 
disengaging from their feared animal at Tl, their attentional blink should be more pronounced 
than that of individuals who are not afraid of the animal at T l.
Relative difficulty disengaging from threatening or negative stimuli has been 
found in recent studies using negative kanji (Japanese characters) in normal subjects 
(Ogawa & Suzuki, 2004), negative words in high trait anxiety (Barnard, Ramponi, 
Battye, & Mackintosh, in press), and negative images in normal subjects (Most, Chun, 
Widders, & Zald, in press). These findings support the notion that both anxious and non- 
anxious individuals may experience difficulty disengaging temporally from negative or 
threat-relevant information.
In addition, Arend and Botella (2002) presented streams of word stimuli, with 
threat and neutral words in the Tl position. Contrary to the hypothesis that anxious 
individuals would have difficulty disengaging from threat-relevant information at T l, the 
authors found a reduced blink period following threat-relevant words at T l for high trait- 
anxious subjects relative to non-anxious subjects. The authors interpreted this finding as 
representative of more efficient processing of threat-relevant word stimuli by anxious 
subjects. It remains to be seen whether the same effects might hold for photo (i.e., non- 
semantic) stimuli. That is, it may be that anxious individuals have overleamed negative

words such that they process (i.e., read) them more efficiently, although their response to 
non-semantic stimuli might not show the same effect. Yet another study found relative 
difficulty with disengagement from threat words (e.g., death) compared to neutral words 
(e.g., table) in all subjects using an RSVP paradigm, but failed to find a greater 
disengagement effect in anxious participants (Yovel, 2002). However, for this study, the 
reported percentages of correctly detected T2 stimuli at the lag most likely to show the 
effect were less than 10%. Thus, a floor effect may have prevented detection of any 
group differences.
Attentional Blink: Orienting
A second possibility is that anxious individuals might exhibit an attenuated blink, 
or facilitated orienting of attention to the second target (T2), when the second target is 
threat-relevant (see Figure 12). Such a finding would support the theorized bias toward 
threat-relevant information, as the interruption of an otherwise normal attentional blink 
would provide strong evidence for the individual attending more quickly to threat­
relevant stimuli. A spider-phobic participant is expected to detect a spider stimulus in the 
T2 position more efficiently than a neutral stimulus if that participant exhibits facilitated 
allocation of attention to threat.

Participants identify the fruit and indicate the presence or absence of an animal. If phobic 
participants exhibit facilitated orienting of attention toward their fear-relevant animal, they should 
show an attenuated blink when their feared animal is in the T2 position.
Anderson and Phelps (2001) found an orienting effect in non-anxious subjects 
with negative words in the T2 position, and another study recently found evidence of 
facilitated orienting of attention toward valenced words at T2 (Keil & Ihssen, 2004). It 
appears that all individuals experience enhanced detection of negative stimuli compared 
to neutral stimuli, which suggests that the proper controls for emotionality and valence 
are a necessity for accurate interpretation of results when doing translational work. 
Another study also failed to find group differences in orienting between anxious and non- 
anxious participants in the RSVP task with anxiety-relevant and neutral words in the T2 
position, although the absence of findings may have been due to design issues that 
resulted in below-chance performance in the task (Yovel, 2002).
The RSVP task also has been used in the clinical literature to compare basic 
temporal allocation of attention in dysphoric individuals compared to normal controls 
(Rokke, Amell, Koch, & Andrews, 2002). The authors used the original design with 
streams of letters to measure temporal processing efficiency. In this case, the authors 
found that dysphoric subjects exhibited a larger attentional blink than control subjects.

This result was interpreted as a general attentional processing deficit in dysphoria, and it 
suggests the need to control for baseline mood state of participants during the RSVP task. 
Attentional Blink: Summary
In sum, temporal allocation of attention has been under-studied in anxiety, 
although recent work confirms the relevance of the temporal dimension as potentially 
problematic. The RSVP paradigm lends itself well to the study of facilitated orienting of 
attention to and difficulty disengaging from anxiety-relevant information over time, and 
one purpose of the present work is to determine whether the effects are enhanced in 
anxiety disorders such as specific phobia. The present studies utilize the RSVP paradigm 
for the examination of the mechanisms of temporal allocation of attention in specific 
phobia.
Experiment 2
The RSVP paradigm assesses temporal allocation of attention and can be used to 
disambiguate the subcomponent processes of attention that might underlie symptom onset 
and maintenance in anxiety. The aims of Experiment 2 were to examine the role of 
temporal orienting of attention to and disengagement of attention from threat stimuli in 
spider and snake phobia, and to determine the feasibility of the use of photo stimuli 
within the RSVP paradigm. I had two primary hypotheses. First, I hypothesized that 
phobic individuals would experience enhanced temporal orienting of attention to phobia­
relevant stimuli (i.e., a smaller attentional blink) to a greater degree than non-fearful 
control participants, and that this effect would be independent of negative valence. This 
hypothesis contrasts with the hypothesized absence of enhanced spatial orienting of 
attention to threat. It is more likely that fear-relevant information will interrupt

concurrent visual processing of non-threat information when the threatening stimulus 
appears in the attended location, than that threat-relevant information will draw attention 
to a different location. Second, I hypothesized that phobic individuals would experience 
greater difficulty disengaging attention temporally from phobia-relevant stimuli (i.e., a 
larger attentional blink) than control participants; this effect also should be independent 
of negative valence.
Method
Participants
Participants were 9 spider-fearful, 15 snake-fearful, and 18 non-fearful controls who were 
recruited from the Yale undergraduate introductory psychology subject pool as well as 
via recruitment posters on campus. I pre-screened potential participants for eligibility 
using a subset of questions from the Snake Anxiety Questionnaire (SNAQ) (Klorman, 
Weerts, Hastings, Melamed, & Lang, 1974), and the Fear of Spiders Questionnaire (FSQ) 
(Szymanski & O’Donohue, 1995) (see Appendix D for pre-screen items). The pre­
screening procedure limited the number of questionnaire items, therefore the entire 
measures could not be used. I used score cutoffs that corresponded to full-measure means 
that were found to be consistent with high animal fear in prior studies (Constantine, 
McNally, & Homig, 2001; Klorman, Weerts, Hastings, Melamed, & Lang, 1974; Muris 
& Merckelbach, 1996; Teachman & Woody, 2003). Accordingly, eligible spider-fearful 
participants scored high on the 10 FSQ items (i.e., at least 42 of 60 possible points) and 
low on the 10 SNAQ items (i.e., 2 or fewer of 10 possible points). The point cutoffs for 
Experiment 2 differed from those of Experiment 1, as the number of items allowed in the 
pre-screening process varied by research site. Eligible snake-fearful participants scored

low on the FSQ items (i.e., 10 or fewer of 60 possible points) and high on the 10 SNAQ 
items (i.e., at least 7 of 10 possible points). Control participants scored low on both 
measures of animal fear. Study participants did not differ significantly on demographic 
variables (see Table 5). Participants were compensated with course credit or cash 
payment of $15 for participating in the 90-minute experiment.

Procedure
The RSVP task was programmed using E-Prime software (Schneider, Eschman, 
& Zuccolotto, 2002a; 2002b). Experimental stimuli were color photo stimuli taken from 
the Internet and equated for size and background using Adobe Photoshop (see 
Appendices E & F for sample photographs). Stimulus photos were 6cm high and 6cm

wide, and they were presented at fixation on a black screen. Distractor stimuli were plant 
and flower photos, critical stimuli were spider, snake, and frog (neutral) photos, and an 
additional set of target stimuli were apple, orange, and grape photos. Individual photo 
backgrounds were either solid (e.g., color of table on which spider stood), textured (e.g., 
sand beneath frog), or natural (e.g., branch beneath snake). Target stimuli were sized to 
fill the 6cm x 6cm space as much as possible.
The stimulus set contained 26 photos from each stimulus type category (e.g., 26 
spider stimuli, 26 apple stimuli). Target and distractor stimuli were randomly selected for 
each trial. Each RSVP photo stream contained 18-20 photos. The first target (Tl) in each 
stream was preceded randomly by 8 or 10 randomly selected distractor photos, and 
second targets (T2) appeared randomly in one of 8 positions, or lags, after T l . Each photo 
stimulus type appeared 4 times at each lag for each of the two conditions (i.e., the 
disengagement block, the orienting block). One additional randomly selected distractor 
photo was presented at the end of each RSVP stream to mask T2 images in the 8th 
position.
Participants were seated in a comfortable chair approximately 70 cm from the 
computer monitor in a sound attenuated room that was dimly lit using a 40 watt lamp 
placed behind a desk. Participants completed six blocks of the RSVP paradigm for a total 
of 576 trials: two orienting blocks; two disengagement blocks; and two single-task, or 
control, blocks. The single-task blocks were identical in stimulus-presentation design to 
the orienting and disengagement blocks, with the exception of instructions. Participants 
did not report the first target for single-task blocks. Eight practice trials preceded each 
block, and block types were counterbalanced across participants (i.e., each participant

completed both disengagement blocks and the disengagement control block, then both 
orienting blocks and the orienting control block, or vice versa).
Orienting trial blocks
Participants completed two orienting trial blocks. Each block began with 8 
practice trials, followed by 96 test trials. All photos were presented for 100ms; this is a 
common presentation time for complex stimuli in the RSVP paradigm, and it is the 
timing parameter that most consistently produced the blink in the piloting phase of the 
study design. Each photo in the RSVP stream contained fruit (neutral) target stimuli in 
the Tl position, and T2-present trials (50%) had an animal at the T2 position (see Figure 
13).

Each block was preceded by a text screen that clearly stated the tasks for that 
block and the order of the stimuli (see Appendix H for text instructions). For the orienting 
block, participants were asked to identify the fruit and indicate whether the animal was 
present or absent. Following each photo stream, the words “apple”, “grape”, and

“orange” appeared in that order on the screen (see Appendix I). Participants pressed the 
“1”, “2”, or “3” keys, which corresponded to the word position on the screen, to report 
the identified fruit. Following that response, participants viewed the words “animal 
present?” on the screen, and responded with “4” for present and “5” for absent. The “4” 
and “5” keys were labeled with “p” for present, and “a” for absent. Participants then 
pressed the spacebar to begin the next trial. Responses were not timed.
Disengagement trial blocks
The disengagement blocks were identical to the orienting blocks with the 
exception of target order. For the measurement of disengagement, animal stimuli 
appeared in the Tl position, and fruit appeared in the T2 position on 50% of trials (see 
Figure 14). Participants were asked to identify the animal and indicate whether the fruit 
was present or absent.

Single-task blocks
Two single-task control blocks of 96 trials each also were presented. One of these 
blocks served as a control for the orienting condition, and the other served as a control for 
the disengagement condition. For each block, the stimulus presentation streams were

identical to those of the orienting and disengagement blocks, but participants were not 
required to identify the first target (Tl). Participants reported only the presence or 
absence of the T2 stimulus during these blocks. This procedure provides a baseline 
measurement of detection of the T2 stimuli; performance on T2 detection should not be 
subject to an attentional blink if participants are not required to attend to the Tl stimulus. 
Performance on these control blocks can assist in ruling out stimulus type effects that 
may interfere with interpretation of dual-task blocks; if  a particular stimulus type is too 
difficult to detect, for example, performance on the single-task will be impaired. 
Questionnaire/Interview measures
Following completion of the experimental tasks, participants completed a battery 
of self-report measures that included the Fear of Spiders Questionnaire (FSQ) 
(Szymanski & O’Donohue, 1995), the Snake Anxiety Questionnaire (SNAQ) (Klorman, 
Weerts, Hastings, Melamed, & Lang, 1974), Fear Questionnaire (FQ) items relevant to 
snake and spider fear (Marks & Mathews, 1979), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory -  
State version (STAI-S) (Spielberger, Gorsuch, & Lushene, 1970), and the Beck 
Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) (Beck, Steer, & Brown, 1996). The experimenter also 
conducted a brief interview with each participant; the interview included Structured 
Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-IV) modules for major depression, psychotic 
symptoms, and phobic symptoms.
We also used a version of the FSQ with items modified to measure snake fear. 
The modified measure (see Appendix G) was included due to its ability to tap avoidance 
and fear of harm, as well as its continuous rating scale, which allows participants to 
provide a more nuanced report of symptoms. Scores on the FSQ modified for snake fear

were highly correlated with scores on the SNAQ in Experiment 2 (r(42)=.92,/?<.01) and 
Experiment 3 (r(18)=.90, /K.01).
Results
Questionnaire/Interview Data 
Participants completed questionnaire measures and responded to interview 
questions following the experimental task. Group scores on questionnaire measures are 
summarized in Table 6. Contrary to expectations based on pre-screening data, snake- 
fearful participants generally did not report clinical levels of snake fear. For example, 
when responding to the SCID interview questions, participants in the snake-fearful group 
denied unreasonable fear and frequently acknowledged that they would be able to touch a 
snake held by someone else. The snake-fearful group mean on the Fear Questionnaire 
phobia severity rating also was lower than expected for a high-fear group. Mean FQ 
severity ratings for a sample of 20 phobic inpatients was 7 of 8 possible points (Marks & 
Mathews, 1978). Although I did not expect mean severity ratings of that magnitude for 
our undergraduate sample, the mean snake-fear group score (M= 2.8, SD= 1.4) was 
considerably lower than what would be considered high-fearful. This mean score 
corresponds to self-reported symptom severity that is “slightly/not really disturbing. In 
contrast, the mean spider-fear group rating (M= 4.1,579=1.7) corresponds to self-reported 
symptom severity that is “definitely disturbing/disabling”. The snake-group responses 
are inconsistent with the diagnostic criteria for phobia; therefore, we dropped this group 
from the present analyses.

SD= 19.6, Muris & Merckelbach, 1996). This reflects the exclusionary criteria in the 
present study. Individuals with the highest reported levels of spider fear on the pre­
screening measures also were likely to report fear of snakes, although only spider-fearful 
participants with low or no snake fear were eligible to participate. Spider-fearful 
participants also scored significantly higher (M= 5.9, SD=2.1) than control participants 
(M= 0.8, <SD=1.1), t (25) = 7.01,/K.001, and snake-fearful participants (M= 3.1, £0=1.8), t

Spider-phobic participants (M=4.1, 50=1.7) also reported a significantly higher 
degree of fear than controls (M= 0.6,50=0.7) on the Fear Questionnaire severity item, t 
(25) = 6.41,/K.OOl. On measures of snake fear, spider-phobic participants were not 
significantly different from control participants. Spider-fearful subjects (M=42.0, 
50=13.2) reported a higher degree of state anxiety than control participants (M=30.1, 
50=7.2), t{25) = 2.47, p=.031, on the STAI-S following the experimental tasks. Spider- 
fearful (M=10.8, 50=6.5) and control participants’ (M=6.3, 50=5.3) scores on the BDI-II 
were not significantly different, t(25) = -1.88,p=.076.
None of the control or spider-fearful participants self-reported clinical levels of 
depression or psychotic symptoms on SCID interview questions following the 
experimental task. None of the control participants reported clinical levels of current or 
lifetime snake or spider fear during the interview. All spider-fearful participants reported 
clinical levels of spider fear (e.g., having had intense fear of spiders their entire lives),

room in which a spider had been seen), and all spider-fearfiil participants denied clinical 
levels of snake fear during the interview.
Tl Performance
For the RSVP paradigm, the primary dependent variable of interest (i.e., percent 
correct detection of T2) is predicated on correct Tl identification. This requirement 
ensures that participants process the Tl stimulus; the attentional blink phenomenon 
requires processing of a first target that subsequently interferes with the second. 
Inaccurate identification of Tl might reflect random responding, which would violate the 
requirement. A one-way ANOVA revealed no significant group differences in Tl 
identification accuracy for any of the four Tl stimulus types, all ps>.05. Accuracy rates 
by Tl stimulus type are presented in Table 7. These results indicate that participants in 
the three groups attended to the Tl task and performed equally well, correctly identifying 
T l stimuli in almost 90% of trials. Participants in all groups appeared to have more 
difficulty identifying fruit stimuli in the Tl position compared to animal stimuli. This 
may have been due to the featural similarity between fruit and distractor (plant and 
flower) stimuli, which suggests the need to control for this property of the distractors in 
further studies.

T2 Performance
The critical data for this study were participants’ T2 detection rates, or the percent of 
correctly detected T2 stimuli given correct identification of T1 stimuli. I excluded from 
the analysis all trials in which participants did not accurately identify T1. It also was 
important to examine false-alarm rates (i.e., responding T2 present on T2-absent trials) 
for potential biased responding. False alarm rates did not vary significantly by group (see 
Table 8), although some participants in each group had relatively high rates.

The basic blink effect was observed1; participants’ overall detection rates for T2 animal 
stimuli produced the prototypical blink pattern (see Figure 15). To examine the basic 
cueing effect in the orienting block, a two-way repeated measures ANOVA was 
conducted with Group as the between-subjects factor and Lag as the within-subjects 
factor. There was a main effect of Lag, F(7,175)= 4.39,/)=.002, r|p2=.150, with a 
Greenhouse-Geisser correction for non-sphericity. Within-subjects contrasts revealed a 
significant cubic trend for Lag, F(1,25)=11.98, p=.002, pp2 = .324, and a significant 
linear trend for Lag, F(l,25) =7.38, /?=.012, pp2 = .228, indicating that T2 performance

for variability in false alarm rates (i.e., reporting T2 present on T2-absent trials), although false alarm rates 
did not vary by group. Given our primary interest in difference values (i.e., within-group differences 
between blink magnitudes for each stimulus type), the transformation is unnecessary, as false-alarm rates 
did not vary by stimulus type.

decreased from lag 1 to lag 2, then improved from lag 2 to later lags. This is the hallmark 
of the attentional blink curve. There was no significant between-groups difference for the 
basic blink effect across stimulus types, F(l,25)=.581,/>=.453, r|p2 =.023. For the 
disengagement block, two-way repeated measures ANOVA also revealed a main effect of 
Lag, F (7,175)= 18.76,/?< 001, r|p2=.429. Within-subjects contrasts revealed a significant 
linear trend for Lag, F  (1,25) =54.74, p<.001, rjp2 = .686, and a significant cubic trend for 
Lag, F  (1,25) =16.26,/?<.001, pp2= .394, again indicating that T2 performance decreased 
from lag 1 to lag 2, and improved from lag 2 to later lags. There also was no significant 
between-groups effect for the basic blink effect across stimulus types, F  (1,25) =. 143, 
/t=.709, pp2 = .006.
For both orienting and disengagement blocks, the blink effect was most obvious 
(i.e., T2 performance was worse) at 200 ms, or lag 2, which is consistent with prior 
studies (e.g., Shapiro, Raymond, & Amell, 1994). Results are presented by block type.

Orienting
A three-way repeated-measures ANOVA was conducted with Group as the 
between-subjects factor, Lag and Stimulus Type as within-subjects factors, and percent 
correct detection of T2 as the dependent variable, to determine whether preferential 
orienting to threat stimuli occurred. The analyses revealed a significant main effect of 
Lag, F(7,175) = 4.39,/?=.002, rjp2 =.150, with a Greenhouse-Geisser correction for non­
sphericity; and a significant main effect of Stimulus Type, F(2,50) = 17.57,/?<.001, rjp2 
=.413, indicating both the presence of the basic attentional blink effect, as well as an 
overall difference in T2 detection by stimulus type across lags. There was no significant 
main effect of Group, F  (1,25) = .581,/?=.453, rip2=.023, although the observed power 
for this comparison was low at .114. The Group by Stimulus Type interaction was not 
significant, F  (2,50) = 2.64,/?=.081, r|p2=.096, but follow-up analyses were conducted for 
spider stimuli to determine potential trends (see Figures 16 & 17). Consistent with the 
hypotheses, spider-phobic participants showed a non-significant trend toward greater 
orienting of attention toward spider stimuli at T2 (M=.88, 5D=.19), compared to control 
participants (M=.68, SD=.34), t (25) = 1.67,/?=.054, one-tailed, d=.13.
Inspection of the basic blink data is important for ensuring that the experiment is 
measuring the blink effect. However, the basic blink effect is not the comparison o f most 
interest; we are interested in the orienting effect toward phobia-relevant stimuli, 
controlling for the baseline blink effect to neutral (frog) stimuli and the blink effect to 
negative (snake) stimuli. I therefore looked at the difference between the magnitude of 
the blink effect for spider stimuli and the magnitude of the blink effect for snake and frog 
stimuli. Because the basic blink data show lag 2 (i.e., 200 ms) as the lag most likely to 
show the blink effect, I used this lag for the comparison of differences. There were no

Disengagement
A three-way repeated measures ANOVA with Group as the between-subjects 
factor, Stimulus Type and Lag as within-subjects factors, and percent correct T2 
identification as the dependent variable, revealed a significant main effect of Lag, F  
(7,175) = 18.76, p<.001, r|p2 = .429 (see Figures 19 & 20). There also was a significant 
main effect of Stimulus Type, F  (2,50) = 3.58, p=.035, pp2 = .125. There were no 
significant interactions of Group by Stimulus Type, F  (2,50)^1.88, p=. 163, pp2 =.070, or 
Lag by Stimulus Type, F(14,350)=.832, p=.635, pp2 =.032. The Group x Stimulus Type x 
Lag three-way interaction also was not significant, F(14,350)=1.19, p=.275, pp2 =.046.
Again, the basic blink data are important for ensuring that the experiment is 
measuring the blink effect, although the basic blink effect is not the measurement of 
greatest interest. I was most interested in the disengagement effect from phobia-relevant 
stimuli, controlling for the baseline disengagement effect from neutral (frog) stimuli and 
negative (snake) stimuli. I therefore looked at the difference between the magnitude of 
the disengagement effect for spider stimuli and the magnitude of the disengagement 
effect for snake and frog stimuli at lag 2, or the lag most likely to show the effect (see 
Figure 21). There were no significant group differences between spider-fearful 
participants (M=.01, 5D=.45) and control participants (M=.09, SD=.33), t{25) =.554, 
p=.585, <7=20, for comparison of disengagement from spider stimuli controlling for 
neutral stimuli. There also were no significant differences between spider-fearful 
participants (M=-.07, SD=.52) and control participants (M=.09, SD=.38), f(25)=949, 
p=. 35, <7=35, for the comparison of disengagement from spider stimuli controlling for 
negative (snake) stimuli.

Single Task Blocks
I included single-task (i.e., no identification of T l) blocks to determine whether 
participants were able to detect T2 stimuli without the added demand of the Tl 
identification task. Differential performance for a particular stimulus type might indicate 
difficulties with stimulus detection that are featural rather than attributable to threat- 
relevance or valence. Consistent with expectations, participants’ single-task data did not 
show a blink pattern; participants showed a high percentage of correct identification of 
single-task targets (T2) when Tl identification was not required.

Experiment 2 Discussion 
The hypotheses of enhanced temporal orienting of attention and difficulty with 
temporal disengagement from phobia-relevant stimuli in fearful participants compared to 
non-fearful controls were not supported. For spider-fearful participants, there was a non­
significant trend toward enhanced orienting toward spider stimuli in the T2 position, and 
a non-significant trend toward enhanced orienting for spider stimuli controlling for 
negative stimuli. Post-hoc power analyses for these comparisons indicated that increased 
sample size might result in significant differences between groups for facilitated orienting 
toward threat-relevant stimuli, such that spider-phobic participants might experience a 
significantly attenuated blink when the T2 stimulus is a spider. In addition to a lack of 
power, there also were several design problems that may have contributed to the absence 
of hypothesized results. Rather than increasing sample size with a potentially problematic 
design, I chose to correct these problems prior to further data collection.
The diagnostic difficulty with the snake-fearful group (i.e., non-phobic 
questionnaire and interview responses post-experiment) appeared to have been caused by 
the vulnerability of the snake fear measures to false-positive responding. For example, 
one item on the SNAQ is “When I see a snake, I feel tense and restless”. Although snake- 
phobic individuals almost certainly will endorse this item, so also might individuals who 
merely dislike snakes, but who do not experience excessive fear of them. I had hoped that 
the FSQ, modified for snake fear, might provide a clearer measure of snake fear due to its 
continuous response scale, however, it is likely that this measure also allowed frequent 
false-positive responding. This problem has been documented; one study that examined 
diagnostic issues with the SNAQ found that many individuals who report a high degree

of snake fear on the measure do not show commensurate fear on behavioral avoidance 
tasks (Klieger & Siejak, 1997). Such an absence of fear in the presence of a live snake is 
inconsistent with a diagnosis of snake phobia. Many researchers utilize this measure to 
select high snake-fear participants, although the argument can be made that conservative 
cutoffs (i.e., 85th percentile) are more likely to exclude false-positive response profiles. 
The snake-fearful participants for the present study also were not those who reported the 
highest degree of snake fear on the pre-screening measure, as those individuals often also 
reported the exclusionary criterion of moderate or high spider fear. As noted earlier, the 
spider-fearful participants also were not those who reported the highest levels of spider 
fear, although they reported phobic levels of spider fear during the post-experiment 
interview.
Spider-fearful participants reported significantly higher levels of state anxiety 
than control participants following the experimental task. Although conclusions cannot 
be drawn based on these data due to the lack of power in Experiment 2, this variable 
might point to a need to control for state anxiety in further work. On the other hand, it 
may be the case that phobic participants only exhibit problematic attentional processing 
when experiencing state anxiety.
Participants’ T2 identification performance in orienting blocks was quite high for 
all T2 stimulus types, which indicates a potential design problem. Prior research shows 
that the basic blink effect results in considerably depressed detection of T2 stimuli 
following Tl identification. Given the research showing that unselected participants 
exhibit an attenuated blink when negative information is in the T2 position (e.g., 
Anderson & Phelps, 2001), one argument for the enhanced orienting performance in

Attentional Capture in Specific Phobia 73
Experiment 2 might be that all participants preferentially detect threatening animals at 
T2. This explanation follows from the notion of preparedness; humans are thought to be 
hard-wired to perceive dangerous animals as negative (Ohman & Mineka, 2001). Were 
this the case, T2 detection of frog stimuli should be worse than T2 detection of spider and 
snake stimuli. The data do not frilly support this explanation; although performance with 
frog stimuli at T2 appeared to be worse than performance for snake and spider stimuli at 
T2, the differences were not significant. An alternate, more likely, explanation is the 
existence of a ceiling effect. That is, if  the orienting blocks were too easy, spider-fearful 
participants would not have room to display enhanced orienting to their feared animal. 
The trend toward enhanced orienting to spider stimuli for spider-fearful participants 
supports the notion that a ceiling effect must be ruled out.
In contrast to performance on the orienting blocks, performance at the 200ms lag 
(i.e., the lag most likely to show the blink effect) on the disengagement blocks was below 
chance. Although no differences were found within or between groups for disengagement 
from the three stimulus types, these findings may reflect a floor effect. It follows that 
fearful participants do not have room to show more difficulty disengaging from their 
fear-relevant stimuli at T l. Modifications to decrease the difficulty of these blocks would 
eliminate the floor effect explanation for the observed null findings.
Experiment 3
Experiment 3 had two overarching aims. Aim 1 was to address the design limitations of 
Experiment 2. To achieve this aim, I made five key design modifications. First, I 
increased the contrast between distractor items and target items in order to eliminate the

Attentional Capture in Specific Phobia 74
floor effect found in the disengagement condition of Experiment 2 .1 accomplished this 
by replacing some of the distractor stimuli (i.e., brightly colored plants and flowers) with 
more homogenous distractor stimuli (i.e., trees) so that the target animal and fruit stimuli 
would be more easily detected. Second, I increased the difficulty of the orienting trial 
blocks to eliminate the ceiling effect found in Experiment 2; I reduced stimulus 
presentation time from 100ms SOA to 70ms SOA. Third, I decreased the number of lags, 
or positions between Tl and T2, from eight to three; I focused on the lags most likely to 
show the effect (i.e., 200-300ms after T l) (e.g., Shapiro, Raymond, & Amell, 1994), and 
one later lag as a measure of return to baseline performance following the blink period. 
This increases power, as each participant completes more trials at each lag. Fourth, I 
excluded snake-fearful participants from the design; the diagnostic difficulties observed 
with Experiment 2 were likely to occur again in Experiment 3, obscuring clean results. I 
retained snake stimuli in the study as a negative, non-phobic stimulus type. Finally, I 
eliminated the single-task control blocks, as single-task performance was not relevant to 
the critical comparisons. Aim 2 was the same as in of Experiment 2: to examine the 
orienting of temporal attention to and difficulty with temporal disengagement from 
phobia-relevant information in spider phobics compared to non-fearful controls.
Method
Participants
For this preliminary study, participants were 4 spider phobics and 9 non-fearful controls 
who were recruited through the Yale University undergraduate introductory psychology 
subject pool. Participants were pre-screened as in Experiment 2, using a subset of 
questions from the Fear of Spiders Questionnaire and the Snake Anxiety Questionnaire.

Pre-screen items and cutoff scores were the same as those used for Experiment 1. Eligible 
fear-group participants scored high on spider fear but low on snake fear, and eligible 
control participants scored low on both snake and spider fear. Participants received 
course credit for the 75-minute experiment. There were no differences between groups on 
demographic variables (see Table 9).
Data were excluded for one spider-phobic participant due to an excessively low 
Tl accuracy rate (i.e., 48%) and an inflated false-alarm rate (i.e., 42% rate o f reporting 
detection of T2 on T2-absent trials). This participant’s Tl accuracy rate was below 
chance, which was grounds for automatic exclusion. Even with an A’ transformation to 
adjust the performance data for false alarm rates, data with Tl identification below 
chance may reflect random responding.

Procedure
Participants completed two 10-trial practice blocks plus two orienting blocks of 108 trials 
and two disengagement blocks of 108 trials, for a total of 452 total trials of the RSVP 
paradigm. As outlined earlier, several design modifications were made, although the 
procedure was similar to that of Experiment 2. For both block types, distractor stimuli 
were more homogenous, and the reduction in number of lags resulted in 12 trials per 
stimulus type, per lag.
Orienting blocks
Participants completed two orienting blocks. The blocks were identical to those of 
Experiment 2, with two exceptions. First, the distractor stimuli were more homogenous,

Attentional Capture in Specific Phobia 77
and, second, stimuli within each stream were presented for 70 ms to decrease 
performance. Fruit stimuli appeared at T l, and animal stimuli appeared at T2; 
participants were asked to identify the fruit and indicate the presence or absence of the 
animal.
Disengagement blocks
Participants completed two disengagement blocks. These blocks also were 
identical to those of Experiment 2, with one exception. The enhanced homogeneity o f the 
distractor stimuli increased their contrast with the target stimuli, increasing performance 
on these blocks. Animal stimuli appeared at T l, and fruit stimuli appeared at T2; 
participants identified the animal and indicated the presence or absence of the fruit. 
Questionnaire/Interview measures
Participants completed the same battery of self-report and interview measures as 
in Experiment 2.
Results 
Tl Performance
Independent samples t-tests revealed no significant differences in overall Tl 
identification accuracy between control (M=.89, SD=.04) and spider-phobic (M=.88,
SD -.05) groups, or for any of the four Tl stimulus types. Accuracy rates by Tl stimulus 
type are presented in Table 10. These results indicate that both groups attended to the Tl 
task and performed equally well, correctly identifying Tl stimuli in just under 90% of 
trials. It is reasonable to assume that Tl stimuli were identifiable, and that T2 detection 
reflected processing of T2 stimuli given attention to Tl stimuli. Participants were 
attending to the Tl stimuli. In general, participants in both groups appeared to have more

difficulty identifying fruit stimuli in the Tl position compared to animal stimuli. This is 
likely because fruit were the Tl stimuli in the facilitation blocks, in which all stimuli 
were presented at a faster rate. Participants also appeared to have more difficulty 
identifying frog stimuli in the Tl position compared to snake and spider stimuli.

T2 Performance
The critical data for this study were participants’ T2 detection rates, or their 
ability to correctly detect the T2 stimulus given correct identification of the Tl stimulus. I 
excluded from the analysis all trials in which participants did not accurately identify T l, 
because inaccurate identification of Tl might reflect inattention to the Tl stimulus. By 
definition, the attentional blink requires attention to T l, in order to assess difficulty 
processing subsequent stimuli. In addition, participant data were examined for excessive 
(i.e., above chance) false alarm rates, or reporting T2 present on T2-absent trials. Several 
participants in Experiment 2 had relatively high false alarm rates, therefore the

instructions for Experiment 3 were altered to emphasize the importance of reporting the 
presence of the T2 stimulus only when certain it was present (see Appendix J for 
instructions). In Experiment 3, no participants were excluded due to false-alarm rate. 
False-alarm rates were higher for the spider-fearful group, although, with the exception of 
a lesser tendency to false-alarm following spider stimuli, they did not vary by stimulus 
type within blocks (see Table 11).

Orienting
Participants’ percent correct detection of T2 animal stimuli followed the typical 
blink pattern (see Figures 22 & 23). The lowest T2 performance for this block was at lag 
3, or 210 ms, (M=.57, SD=.23). Although the SOAs for the orienting blocks in the 
present study were faster (i.e., 70 ms per stimulus) than those of Experiment 1 (i.e., 100

ms per stimulus), the blink effect still should be most obvious at approximately the same 
temporal position as that of Experiment 1 (i.e., 200 ms). Better average T2 detection 
performance at lag 2 (M=.65 ,5Z)=.15), and lag 8 (M=72, SD=. 10) compared to 
performance at lag 3 would support the evidence of a blink at lag 3.
A two-way repeated measures ANOVA with Group as the between-subjects 
factor, Lag as the within-subjects factor, and correct detection of T2 as the dependent 
variable, revealed no significant main effect of Lag, F(2,22)=1.52, p-.242, pp2 = .121, 
indicating the potential absence of the basic blink effect across groups. There also was no 
significant main effect of Group, F ( l,l  1)= 4.72, p=.053, pp2 = . 300. Observed power for 
this comparison was low, at .288. However, there was a significant interaction of Group 
by Lag in the expected direction, F(2,22)=3.07,/?=034, one-tailed, pp2 = .218, indicating 
that the absence of a statistically significant basic blink effect across groups may have 
been due to a “reverse” blink effect for one group (i.e., better performance at the lag most 
likely to show the effect).
A three-way repeated measures ANOVA with Group as the between-subjects 
factor, Stimulus Type and Lag as within-subjects factors, and percent correct T2 
detection as the dependent variable, revealed a significant main effect of Stimulus Type, 
F(2,22)=25.66, j9<.001, pp2 = .700; and a significant Stimulus Type by Group interaction, 
F(2,22)=9.59,/>=.001, pp2 = .466 (see Figures 21 & 22). There was no significant 
interaction of Stimulus Type by Lag, F(4,44)=.234, /?=.918, pp2 = .021; or Stimulus Type 
x Lag x Group, F(4,44)=1.12,/?=.36, pp2 = .092.
The basic blink effect was most obvious for control participants at 210ms, or lag 
3, which is consistent with the literature. Consistent with the hypothesis o f an attenuated

blink in spider-phobics, this pattern was inverted for spider-phobic participants, 
indicating facilitated orienting of attention at lag 3. Follow-up t-tests showed that one 
basic blink magnitude differed significantly between groups. At lag 3, spider-phobic 
participants showed enhanced orienting of attention toward spider stimuli at T2 (M=.94, 
SD=.09), compared to control participants (M=.39, SD=.31), t (11) = 3.4,/?=.001, d=2A\.
The basic blink data are important for ensuring that the experiment is measuring 
the blink effect. However, the basic blink effect is not the comparison of most interest; 
we are interested in the orienting effect toward phobia-relevant stimuli, controlling for 
the baseline blink effect to neutral (frog) stimuli and the blink effect to negative (snake) 
stimuli. I therefore looked at the difference between the magnitude of the blink effect for 
spider stimuli and the magnitude of the blink effect for snake and frog stimuli.

The preliminary data showed no significant differences between orienting to 
spider stimuli and snake or frog stimuli at lags other than lag 3 (210ms). At lag 3, spider 
phobic participants (M=.42, SD=.20) showed a significantly enhanced orienting to spider 
stimuli controlling for neutral stimuli than did control participants (M=~.05, SD=.25), 
t( 11) = -3.29,/?=.007. <7=2.07 (see Figure 24). Spider-phobic participants (M=. 10,
SD=. 16) also had a significantly greater orienting effect for spider stimuli controlling for 
negative stimuli than did control participants (M=-.24, SD=.18), t( 11) = 3.24,/?=.008., 
(7=1.99. The orienting effect was in the reverse direction for control participants; control 
participants showed enhanced orienting to neutral and snake stimuli compared to spider 
stimuli.
Disengagement
Participants’ percent-correct detection of T2 fruit stimuli given animal Tl stimuli 
followed the typical blink pattern. A two-way ANOVA with Group as the between- 
subjects factor, Lag as the within-subjects factor, and percent correct T2 detection across 
stimulus types as the dependent variable revealed a significant main effect of lag, F  
(2,22) = 26.12,/?<.001, pp2 = .704. A within-subjects contrast revealed a linear trend for 
lag F ( l,l  1) = 41.55,/K.001, pp2 = .791. This pattern reflects the prototypical attentional 
blink; the effect was most obvious at 200 ms, or lag 2 (M=.58, SD=. 19), and performance 
improved as T2 distance from Tl increased; this was apparent in the improvement in lag 
3 performance (M=.69, SD=A6) and lag 6 performance (M=.85, SD=.08). The between- 
subjects Group effect was not significant, F ( l,l  1) = .446,/>=.518, pp2 = .039.

dependent variable, revealed no significant differences of Stimulus Type, F(2,22) =

in the expected direction, F(2,22) = 3.37,/?=.027, one-tailed, r|p2 = .235 (see Figures 25

effect for spider stimuli compared to snake and frog stimuli.

Again, the basic blink data are important for ensuring that the experiment is 
measuring the blink effect, although the basic blink effect is not the measurement of most 
interest. We are interested in the disengagement effect from phobia-relevant stimuli, 
controlling for the baseline disengagement effect from neutral (frog) stimuli and negative 
(snake) stimuli. I therefore looked at the difference between the magnitude of the 
disengagement effect between stimulus types.
The preliminary data show no significant differences between disengagement 
from spider stimuli and snake or frog stimuli at lags other than lag 2 (200 ms), therefore 
this lag was used for the analysis. At lag 2, spider phobic participants (M=.20, SD=. 18) 
showed significantly greater difficulty disengaging from spider stimuli controlling for 
neutral stimuli than did control participants (M=-. 10, SD=.23,), t( 11) = -2.31,/?=.041, 
d=\A5 (see Figure 27). Spider-phobic participants (M=. 15, SD=.31) did not show 
significantly greater difficulty disengaging from spider stimuli controlling for negative 
stimuli than control participants (M=-.10, SD=.21), t( 11) = -1.59,/?=. 139, d=.83. Post-hoc 
power for this comparison is low, at .28, although the effect size is large, which indicates 
possible Type II error. Power was influenced by the extreme response times for one 
spider-fearful participant, which resulted in large standard deviations in this preliminary 
sample. The disengagement effect was in the reverse direction for control participants; 
control participants showed less difficulty disengaging from spider and snake stimuli 
compared to neutral stimuli.

negative and neutral blink effects. Standard error for spider-phobic participants’ mean, 
controlling for negative valence, is driven by one participant’s unusual scores (i.e., greater 
difficulty with disengagement from snake-stimuli relative to spider-stimuli) in this block. This 
participant also self-reported greater snake-fear than other spider-phobic participants on 
questionnaire measures.
Questionnaire/Interview Data 
Participants’ scores on questionnaire measures are summarized in Table 12. 
Control participants’ scores on the two spider fear measures were significantly different 
from those of spider-phobic participants. On the Fear of Spiders Questionnaire, spider- 
phobic participants scored significantly higher (M=82.3, SZ>=21.8) than control 
participants (M=7.7, £0=5.0), t (11) = 10.2, £>=.006. Spider-phobic participants also 
scored significantly higher (M=6.3, £0=1.7) than control participants (M= 1.0, £0=.87) 
on the Fear Questionnaire item of spider fear, t (11) = 7.5, £>=.000. Spider-phobic 
participants (M= 4.5, £0=2.6) also reported a higher degree of fear than controls (M=\ .4, 
£0=1.1) on the Fear Questionnaire severity item, and the one-tailed t-test was significant, 
t (11) = 3.0, £>=.05. On measures of snake fear, spider-phobic participants were not

significantly different from control participants, and the groups also did not differ 
significantly on state anxiety (STAI-S) measures or depression (BDI-II) measures 
following the experimental tasks. Although phobic participants reported more state 
anxiety and symptoms of depression than control participants, it is unlikely that the 
results
were attributable to those symptoms, as high scores for phobic participants were in the 
mild range for state anxiety and symptoms of depression.
None of the control or spider-phobic participants self-reported clinical levels of 
depression or psychotic symptoms on SCID interview questions following the 
experimental task. None of the control participants reported clinical levels of current or 
lifetime snake or spider fear during the interview. All four phobic participants reported 
clinical levels of spider fear (e.g., having had intense fear of spiders their entire lives), 
and denied clinical levels of snake fear during the interview.

Experiment 3 Discussion 
The design modifications in Experiment 3 corrected several problems from 
Experiment 2. T2 detection performance decreased in the orienting blocks at the faster 
SO A, and T2 detection performance improved in the disengagement blocks with 
increased contrast between distractors and targets. T1 accuracy was acceptable for both 
block types. It appears likely that the design modifications increased the validity o f the 
inferences drawn from performance on this paradigm.
The data provide preliminary support for the hypotheses that phobic participants 
show (1) more difficulty disengaging temporally from threat-relevant stimuli; and (2) 
enhanced orienting of temporal attention to their threat-relevant stimuli. Of particular 
interest is the finding that the within- and between- group differences in orienting to 
spider stimuli appear to be phobia-specific. The analysis of spider-stimulus orienting 
effects controlling for neutral (frog) and negative (snake) stimulus effects provides 
compelling evidence that spider phobics’ attentional processing of phobic stimuli might 
be unique. This implies that, consistent with expectations, the difference between the 
blink magnitudes for spider stimuli and neutral stimuli in both orienting and 
disengagement blocks may not provide the cleanest measure of attentional processing of 
threat-relevance. The addition of a negative, non-threat stimulus category provides a 
necessary control for the measurement of preferential attentional processing o f threat­
relevant information beyond processing of negative information. The finding suggests a 
particularly robust effect, particularly as the sample size for this preliminary study is 
small. It appears clear that individuals with phobias do experience involuntarily 
facilitated temporal orienting of attention to threat. The disengagement effect, controlling

for negative valence, was not significant, although the effect size was large. It may be 
that individuals with phobias do not experience more difficulty disengaging from threat, 
although it seems more likely that the absence of an effect is due to inadequate sample 
size.
General Discussion 
The current work makes three unique contributions to the literature in 
attention and anxiety. First, the preliminary data suggest that specific phobia may be 
characterized by (1) difficulty with spatial disengagement from threat-relevant 
information; (2) enhanced temporal orienting of attention to threat that is incrementally 
greater than temporal orienting of attention to negative valence; and (3) potential 
difficulty with temporal disengagement of attention from threat. Second, the present work 
provides behavioral data that converge with recent research implicating deficits in 
inhibitory control of threat-relevant information in anxious individuals. Finally, this work 
represents the successful initial translation of contemporary theory and methods from 
vision science for the study of attentional processing in clinical disorder.
Attentional Processing in Specific Phobia
Experiment 1 examined of the subcomponents of attention using the cueing 
paradigm. The findings suggest that specific phobia is not characterized by enhanced 
spatial orienting of attention to phobia-relevant stimuli. This finding is consistent with a 
small amount of recent research in the area of attention and anxiety using paradigms that 
distinguish between the subcomponents of attentional processing (e.g., Fox, Russo, 
Bowles, & Dutton, 2001). Also consistent with expectations and the literature in anxiety,

the results provide evidence that individuals with specific phobia experience difficulty 
with spatial disengagement from phobia-relevant stimuli. This effect also appears to be 
independent of difficulty with disengagement from negatively-valenced stimuli. These 
findings also represent the first use of this spatial paradigm with photo stimuli and a 
clinical population.
The results of the current work also show that individuals with specific phobia 
attend differently to their feared stimuli temporally when compared to non-fearful 
individuals. Experiment 3 provides preliminary evidence that spider-phobic individuals 
experience significantly enhanced temporal orienting of attention to phobia-relevant 
stimuli. This effect cannot be attributed to stimulus effects (e.g., spider stimuli easier to 
see), as non-fearful control participants did not show the same degree of orienting to the 
same stimuli. The effect also cannot be attributed to negative stimulus valence; spider- 
phobic participants displayed significantly enhanced orienting of attention to threat­
relevant stimuli than to negative, non-threat stimuli. It therefore is likely that this 
preliminary finding reflects uniquely enhanced temporal orienting of attention to phobic 
stimuli in phobic participants. It is possible that this differential processing o f threat­
relevant stimuli has a significant role in the onset and maintenance of symptoms of 
phobia, as facilitated orienting of attention to threat-information clearly interrupts 
concurrent processing of other, potentially important, tasks.
The preliminary data also suggest that individuals with specific phobia may 
experience greater difficulty with temporal disengagement of attention from phobic 
stimuli. Experiment 3 indicates that phobic participants experience significantly greater 
difficulty disengaging from spider-stimuli compared to neutral stimuli, whereas non­

fearful controls do not. Again this effect cannot be attributed to stimulus differences. A 
negative valence effect cannot be ruled out based on these data; there were no significant 
group differences in disengagement from phobic stimuli controlling for negative stimuli. 
However, this absence of a significant effect may be driven by the data from one spider- 
phobic participant who also self-reported higher snake-fear than other spider-phobic 
participants, such that this participant showed greater difficulty disengaging from snake 
stimuli. A larger sample size will be necessary to determine whether the disengagement 
effect is phobic stimulus-specific, rather than attributable to negative valence.
The finding that individuals with specific phobia appear to experience enhanced 
orienting of attention to threat temporally, but not spatially, is interesting from a clinical 
perspective. Phobia and the other anxiety disorders often are characterized by scanning 
behaviors, as when an individual with spider phobia checks a room for spiders upon 
entering. Such scanning is a voluntary, goal-directed behavior that is motivated by a 
desire to avoid being surprised by threat. The present results show that spatial orienting 
of attention to phobia-relevant stimuli, such as spiders, is not enhanced in phobic 
individuals. It seems possible, therefore, that there is an interaction of goal-directed 
behavior (i.e., scanning), and lower level stimulus attributes during detection of threat. 
The purposeful scanning behavior may be more likely to result in enhanced temporal 
orienting once attention has been spatially directed to a particular location. Once his 
attention is directed to a windowsill, for example, a spider phobic might have his 
attention captured by a small dark shape with legs faster than a non-phobic. Should this 
be the case, it may be that teaching phobics to reduce scanning behaviors may be as 
useful as exposure to the threat-relevant stimulus. Exposure-based therapies that were

developed from the principles of learning (i.e., habituation to threat) are the gold-standard 
treatment for phobia, and they are highly effective (Antony & Barlow, 1998). We do not 
yet know whether exposure allows individuals to disengage more effectively, or to inhibit 
orienting behavior. Should the same pattern of spatial and temporal allocation of attention 
be found in other anxiety disorders, such as PTSD, the clinical utility could be 
considerable. Combat-related PTSD, for example, often is characterized by excessive 
scanning behaviors that are overleamed during the combat tour. Helping patients reduce 
their scanning behavior may be helpful in reducing the number of accessible problematic 
visual stimuli. The parsing of disengagement versus orienting of attention also might help 
discern whether individuals with anxiety experience symptoms as a result of threat 
stimulus detection versus continued processing of the lingering representations of such 
stimuli.
Implications fo r  the Role o f Cognitive Control in Anxiety
The present work provides interesting converging evidence for the role of 
inhibitory control of attentional processing of threat-relevant information in anxiety. The 
current behavioral evidence suggests that individuals with phobia, and, by extension, 
individuals with other anxiety disorders, may experience decreased executive functioning 
when attending to threat-relevant stimuli. Researchers recently have debated whether 
threat information can be detected without attention (e.g.,Vuilleumier, Armony, Driver,
& Dolan, 2001), or whether even minimal attentional resources are required for threat 
detection (Anderson, Christoff, Panitz, DeRosa, & Gabrieli, 2003; Bishop, Duncan, & 
Lawrence, 2004; Pessoa, Kastner, & Ungerleider, 2002,2003). The most recent findings 
highlight the notion that some degree of attention is required for amygdala activation,

Attentional Capture in Specific Phobia 95
which is generally accepted as the brain’s gateway for emotional processing (e.g., 
Carlsson, Petersson, Lundqvist, Karlsson, Ingvar, & Ohman, 2004). The evidence 
suggests that participation in a task that requires significant attentional resources 
precludes attention to and amygdala activation in response to non-task-relevant threat 
information (e.g., Pessoa et al., 2003, 2003). Neuroscientists who have conducted 
examinations of differential processing of threat have addressed individual differences in 
the degree to which anxiety status affects the initial amygdala response, as well as the 
degree to which pre-frontal functioning (i.e., executive control) is impaired. For example, 
one fMRI study examined the moderating role of state anxiety in pre-frontal activation to 
threat stimuli, and found that state anxiety is associated with reduced recruitment of 
executive control areas (i.e., lateral pre-frontal cortex and rostral anterior cingulate 
cortex) in the presence of task-irrelevant stimuli (Bishop, Duncan, Brett, & Lawrence, 
2004). These results provide strong support for the notion that individuals experience 
decreased cognitive control over attentional processing of threat when in an anxious state.
In addition, an elegant recent positron emission tomography (PET) study 
compared snake and spider phobics’ amygdala and pre-frontal cortex (PFC) activation to 
their phobic stimuli (e.g., spider stimuli to spider phobic), to non-phobic fear stimuli 
(e.g., snake stimuli to spider phobic), and to neutral stimuli. They found initial amygdala 
activation for both phobic and non-phobic fear stimuli at very short durations (i.e., 14 ms 
presentation followed immediately by 56 ms mask), indicating activation of the threat- 
detection system. At a longer duration, (i.e., after a 14 ms presentation, 294 ms blank, 56 
ms mask) amygdala activation persisted, and recruitment of other affective areas occurred 
only for phobic stimuli. In contrast, at the longer duration, there was evidence of

recruitment of executive control areas (e.g., right PFC, dorsolateral preffontal cortex) for 
non-phobic fear stimuli, but deactivation of these areas for phobic stimuli. This pattern of 
results suggests that state anxiety is not the only moderating variable. It is likely that 
phobic individuals experienced some degree of anxiety during the entire task, as they 
were viewing their phobic stimuli intermittently; the pattern of persistent affective 
processing (i.e., amygdala activation) only for their phobic stimuli provides evidence that 
the results cannot be attributed to state anxiety.
In light of this work, the present behavioral studies appear to provide converging 
evidence for reduced cognitive control over attentional processing of threat. The PET and 
fMRI data suggest possible neural correlates of the behavioral attentional processing data. 
For example, the PET procedure timeline combined with the cueing and RSVP paradigm 
timelines sketch the possible interplay of neural and behavioral mechanisms. Although 
the timelines cannot be precisely compared due to differences in the methods, it appears 
possible that amygdala activation occurs first (14 ms), which is consistent with the notion 
of the amygdala as a threat sensor for perceptual information. The spatial orienting 
response (i.e., the cueing results), which does not appear to discriminate by threat- 
relevance, may occur next within the 100 -  200 ms window. Once threat-relevant 
information is attended, relative difficulty with disengaging temporally from that 
information and more efficient orienting to that information in the same spatial location 
appears to occur around 200 ms (i.e., temporal orienting in RSVP paradigm). Difficulty 
with spatial disengagement from threat seems to occur at approximately the same point 
(300 ms in cueing paradigm) at which anxious individuals experience decreased 
executive control (e.g., less recruitment of PFC) and continued activation of amygdala

and other affective brain areas. Together, the neuroscience and behavioral data support 
the notion that anxious individuals experience significant difficulty with inhibitory 
control of attentional processing of threat.
Translation o f  Contemporary Theory and Methods
The current work also provides evidence that the cue validity and the RSVP 
paradigms, which have been developed by vision researchers to measure spatial and 
temporal allocation of attention, can be translated for the study of clinically relevant 
cognitive processing. These and similar paradigms are well-established in the cognitive 
literature for the examination of basic attentional processing, and they can be used to 
answer longstanding questions of interest regarding problematic processing in clinical 
disorders. I modified the cue validity and RSVP paradigms by replacing the original 
stimuli with disorder-relevant photo stimuli, and found that the cueing and blink effects 
could be found with the photo stimuli. The work also illustrates the need for careful 
attention to design parameters and systematic elimination of alternate explanations in 
order to be confident of the validity of the inferences drawn.
The data from Experiment 2 indicated design problems related to stimulus 
features and timing parameters. During the subsequent design modification phase, I 
systematically eliminated stimulus and timing problems. The improved design was used 
for Experiment 3, with greatly increased validity. The fundamental finding of group 
differences in the expected directions supports the notion that this and similar basic 
paradigms can be translated for the accurate examination of processing in clinical 
disorders.

Attentional Capture in Specific Phobia 98
The use of measurement paradigms that assess attentional processing in 
milliseconds prompts the question of generalizability. Measurement of attention during 
sudden onsets of photo stimuli represents an improvement over the use of word stimuli 
for the examination of attentional processing in phobia, but such improvement still may 
fail to approximate the experience of anxiety in the world. On the other hand, it is 
possible that the effects found with the relatively “safe” experimental stimuli translate to 
robust effects in the world when, for example, a spider-phobic individual encounters an 
actual spider. It also is quite likely that anxiety disorders that are associated with extreme 
responses to cues that may be only slightly threat-relevant, such as post-traumatic stress 
disorder, are characterized by responding on a timescale that is quite rapid. A related 
issue concerns the degree to which the behaviors participants can do in the experimental 
context translates to what they actually do in the world. These are empirical questions 
that should be addressed in the future.
Clinical Utility o f  Methods
These paradigms also have potential clinical utility for the refinement of 
mechanistic models of anxiety disorders. Attentional retraining procedures that utilize 
performance-based paradigms have received increasing emphasis recently (e.g., 
MacLeod, Rutherford, Campbell, Ebsworthy, & Holker, 2002). One elegant set of studies 
found that an anxiety response to a subsequent stressor can be induced through the 
manipulation of threat stimulus presentations in the dot-probe task (Mathews &
MacLeod, 2002), which the authors interpret as evidence for the causal role of attentional 
processing of threat information in anxiety. Several researchers have presented intriguing 
findings that suggest that the retraining of attentional allocation (e.g., training patients to

attend to neutral rather than negative words) can result in decreased self-reported anxiety 
symptoms (e.g., Rutherford, MacLeod, & Campbell, 2002). These retraining paradigms 
generally utilize the dot-probe paradigm, which of course is a spatial paradigm. The 
results of the present work suggest that the retraining paradigms actually may train 
patients to disengage from threat rather than orient their attention preferentially to neutral 
or positive information. The present results also suggest that the use of temporal 
paradigms in attentional retraining may tap the dimension of processing that may be most 
problematic in some anxiety disorders. In sum, the results of the retraining studies are 
promising, and it seems likely that the paradigms used in the present work not only could 
be used as easily, but also would provide clearer interpretation of the mechanisms of 
change.
Translation o f  Attentional Capture Model
The present work also suggests that the theoretical model of attentional capture 
(Yantis & Jonides, 1984), which includes the subcomponents of attentional processing, 
appears to be well-suited to the examination of processing in specific phobia as an 
instance of anxiety disorder. The attentional capture construct eliminates the ambiguity of 
the “bias” construct; attentional capture allows the subdivision of attentional processing 
into the mechanisms of (1) orienting of attention to threat; and (2) disengagement of 
attention from threat. The present work is the first to use the cue validity paradigm and 
the RSVP paradigm with photo stimuli for the study of attentional processing in clinically 
anxious participants. The work provides converging evidence for the recent work that 
uses spatial paradigms to examine the role of the subcomponents of attentional capture in 
anxiety (e.g., Amir et al., 2003; Fox et al., 2001). The findings from Experiment 1 extend
Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.
Attentional Capture in Specific Phobia 100
the prior findings that suggest that attentional processing in anxiety is characterized by 
difficulty with spatial disengagement from threat-relevant information, rather than 
enhanced orienting of attention to threat-relevant information (e.g., Amir et al., 2003; Fox 
et al., 2001). In contrast, the preliminary findings in the temporal domain suggest 
prominent temporal orienting of attention to threat, in addition to potential difficulty with 
disengagement. This discrepancy across attentional modalities supports the notion that 
the temporal/spatial distinction is important for the thorough examination of attentional 
processing in anxiety.
Limitations
The present work also has several limitations. First, the RSVP data are 
preliminary; the cells in Experiment 3 must be filled in order to more confidently outline 
the mechanisms of temporal attentional difficulties in specific phobia. In particular, the 
disengagement data suffer due to the small sample size and the disproportionate influence 
of one participant’s outlying data. Additional participants will be recruited to address this 
limitation. Second, the strongest evidence for effects that are specific to phobic stimuli is 
the presence of a crossover effect between the means for two groups of phobic 
individuals, such that the negative, non-threat stimulus for one group would be the phobic 
stimulus for the other. For example, for spider-phobic participants, spiders are threat 
stimuli and snakes are negative, non-threat stimuli, whereas the reverse is true for snake- 
phobic participants. In the present work, the observed difficulty with the recruitment of 
true snake-phobic participants limits the ability to interpret the incremental blink 
magnitude for phobic-stimulus as a ftmction of threat-relevance rather than low-level 
stimulus differences. Third, I did not assess the potential moderating role of participants’

state anxiety prior to or during the experimental tasks. It is possible that anxiety levels by 
group peaked differentially during the sessions and affected performance. Indeed, I 
hypothesize that the subcomponents of attentional processing play a role in the onset or 
maintenance o f symptoms; it is reasonable to assume that phobic participants experienced 
spikes of anxiety on viewing their feared stimuli during the experiments that may have 
contributed to the results. This response also may have habituated during the course of 
the experiment. Prompts for anxiety ratings could be built into the blocks at regular 
intervals to assess the potential influence of subjective state anxiety during the course of 
the experiment. Fourth, I did not assess sleep deprivation, caffeine consumption, or 
nicotine intake prior to experimental sessions; these are potential influences on 
performance that are likely to occur in an undergraduate population.
Clinical Implications
The clinical implications of the present work, as well as future work, might 
include increased diagnostic utility. Self-report measures remain the gold-standard in 
clinical psychology, out of necessity. Self-report is vulnerable to potential confounds 
such as social desirability. In addition, individuals are unlikely to be able to report 
problematic processing, such as attentional processing, that happens very rapidly and can 
lead to symptoms. Performance-based measures such as the RSVP and cue validity tasks 
provide a more objective means of assessing potentially problematic processing. 
Following the basic work necessary to identify the patterns of problematic processing in 
the various anxiety disorders, performance-based tasks will allow more definitive 
diagnosis o f functional difficulties. In particular, performance-based tasks may reliably 
distinguish between the presence of disorder and false-positives. Finally, these tasks also

may be used as treatment outcome measures; it is possible that exposure-based therapies 
for anxiety disorders reduce problematic attentional processing, which in turn reduces 
symptom occurrence.
Future Directions
This work represents an initial step in the translation of the attentional capture 
model and temporal measurement paradigms for the examination of the mechanisms of 
attentional processing in clinical disorder. Future work should include a thorough 
examination of spatial and temporal disengagement and orienting of attention to threat in 
the various anxiety disorders. This information will assist in the development of more 
mechanistic models of the anxiety response as well as models of the potentially unique 
patterns of attentional difficulties for the different anxiety disorders. For example, the 
present data suggest that individuals with specific phobia experience both facilitated 
temporal orienting of attention to threat and difficulty disengaging spatially and 
temporally from threat. This pattern might reflect the nature of temporal allocation of 
attention in the circumscribed fear response (i.e., the fear response is specific to the 
phobic stimulus). On the other hand, anxiety disorders such as panic disorder include an 
element of more diffuse anxiety, and such disorders might be characterized by facilitated 
temporal allocation of attention to visual threat information, but not by difficulty with 
disengagement from visual information. That is, an individual with panic disorder might 
be capable of disengaging relatively efficiently from the visual stimulus at hand (e.g., 
visual cue associated with prior panic attack) while shifting to internal threat cues (i.e., 
increased heart rate). Although the bulk of the current literature focuses on spatial

attentional processing in anxiety, data from temporal designs will provide important 
converging evidence that supports the pervasiveness of attentional difficulties in anxiety.
A next step will be to determine the conditions under which these attentional 
effects occur. For example, should difficulty with spatial and temporal disengagement of 
attention be implicated in the onset and maintenance of symptoms of PTSD, it will be 
important theoretically and clinically to know the circumstances in which the difficulties 
exist. A hypothetical finding that individuals with PTSD do not experience problematic 
attentional processing when they are relaxed, for example, would add a moderating 
variable to a mechanistic model, as well as provide a rationale and logical point of entry 
for clinical intervention.
Summary
The current work represents the unique translation of a contemporary theoretical 
model and two visual-attention paradigms for the examination of the orienting and 
disenagagement mechanisms of attention in specific phobia. Preliminary results indicate 
that phobic individuals experience facilitated temporal orienting of attention toward 
threat-relevant stimuli that is independent of their negative valence, and that phobic 
individuals also experience difficulty disengaging temporally and spatially from threat­
relevant stimuli. This successful translation of a contemporary theoretical model of 
attentional processing, and two of its attending measurement paradigms, offers a valuable 
new approach to the understanding of attentional mechanisms that may be implicated in 
symptom onset and maintenance in anxiety, and provides a promising new direction for 
the development of treatments for anxiety disorders.

Look directly at the plus sign, and then press a button when ready.
A picture (of a frog, snake, or spider) will then appear very briefly in one of the boxes 
followed by either an "X" or an "O" in one of the boxes.
Your task is to press the left button if the "X" appears or the right button if  the "O" 
appears. Please respond AS QUICKLY AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN while remaining 
accurate. In addition, please DO NOT LOOK AWAY FROM THE PLUS SIGN 
DURING THE TRIAL. The experimenter will monitor your eye on a video monitor and 
give you feedback if your eyes move.
On most trials, the "X" or "O" will appear in the same box in which the picture appeared. 
On other trials, the "X" or "O" will appear in a different box. Your task is the same in 
both cases.
You will complete a practice session of 28 trials and an experiment session of 576 trials. 
A break is scheduled halfway through the experiment session. Please feel free to take 
additional breaks if  needed.
If you have any questions, please ask the experimenter.

Experiment 2 Participant Instructions
Instructions for Participants
Please situate yourself comfortably in front of the computer. Take a moment to adjust 
your sitting position and distance from the computer, as it will be difficult to do so once 
the experiment has begun. During the experiment, the overhead lights will be turned off 
to minimize outside interference.
In this experiment, you will view streams of photographs, one after the other, very fast. 
Then you’ll be asked questions about specific photos within the streams. I’ll explain the 
experiment now, but don’t worry about remembering everything.
Each stream of photos will be presented very rapidly -  10 photographs per second. Most 
of the photos are of plants or flowers. Each stream will also contain a photo that is either 
an animal (always a spider, snake, or frog), or fruit (always apples, oranges, or grapes). 
Some of the streams will also contain a second photo that is fruit if  the first was an 
animal, and vice versa. Your primary task is to identify the first photo (first target) and 
your secondary task is to indicate whether the second photo (second target) was present 
or not.
There are four sections to the study, and the order of target photos will vary by section. 
Each section will be preceded by a screen that clearly states the order of target 
presentation for that section. During two of the four sections, you will only answer one 
question - whether the second target photo was present or not. Each photo stream is 
followed by the relevant questions and response options. Your responses will NOT be 
timed -  take as much time as you need.
We’re exploring the limits of ‘visual attention’ in this experiment, and this is a very 
difficult task. Sometimes the first target photo is very difficult to see, and you may often 
have no idea which of the items you saw during the stream. In this case, don’t worry — 
just go with your intuition!
This task is very attention-demanding so please do your very best to stay alert and 
focused as much as possible throughout the experiment. We really appreciate your effort 
here —  we know that this task can be long and frustrating, but it really helps us to 
understand the visual system if  you try as hard as you can!

Attentional Capture in Specific Phobia 116
The experiment will involve 576 trials. After each trial you will press the spacebar to 
begin the next trial, and before doing so you can always take a short pause to stretch or 
get focused before continuing. Each new block will begin with a blue screen. You may 
want to take a brief break when these screens appear. All responses will be made using 
the 1,2,3,4 & 5 keys. The first response indicates which of the three target photos you 
saw -  1, 2 & 3 keys will correspond to the response options. So, for example, if  the first 
target is fruit, “apple grape orange” will appear on the screen. They correspond to “1 
2 3”. The next screen will ask “animal present?” We’ve labeled the “4” key with “p”
for present, and the “5” key with “a” for absent. Sometimes it’s easy to get going so fast 
that you respond automatically with the wrong key. Remember, this is NOT timed, so 
take the time to focus on your responses.
The first eight trials in each block will serve as practice trials, and we will not use the 
results from those. The purpose of the practice trials is just to give you a chance to 
become familiar with the particular photo targets and distractors that are being used here, 
and to become comfortable with the task.
The computerized portion of the experiment will take about 1 hr 15 minutes. Following 
these tasks, the experimenter will ask you a set of questions and ask you to complete a 
brief questionnaire.
Please ask the experimenter at any time if you have any questions!

Each stream of photos will be presented very rapidly -  for half the experiment, you will 
view 10 photographs per second, and in the other half you will view approximately 13 
photos per second. Most of the photos are of plants or flowers. Each stream will also 
contain a photo that is either an animal (always a spider, snake, or frog), or fruit (always 
apples, oranges, or grapes). Some of the streams will also contain a second photo that is

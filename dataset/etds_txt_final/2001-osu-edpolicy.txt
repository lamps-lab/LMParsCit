ABSTRACT 
Throughout Western civilization, creativity has been studied via positivist 
methodologies, and theories of creativity have been accepted in such fields as education, 
the arts, science, and business.  However, Modernist/positivist approaches to creativity 
carry with them inherent problems.  Issues central to academic discourse in the Twenty-
First Century include cultural and gender diversity, authorship, originality, genius, and 
constructivism.  Recognition of these issues requires a re-examination of theories and 
assumptions about creativity. 
This philosophical study is a critical analysis of creativity theories conducted from a 
Postmodern, deconstructive perspective.  It examines modern views of creativity, identifying 
biases, omissions, and meta-narratives.  It also looks at postmodern views related to creativity, 
finding nihilism and negation. 
In hopes of salvaging a concept of creativity, this study advances a theory that 
creativity is a form of experience and catharsis which can manifest across cultures, genders, 
socio-economic groups, and in a vast array of domains.  The study ends with a call for research 
that is less dependent on quantitative methodologies, more inclusive in its populations, and 
ii 
more open to creativity in normal life situations.  The result is an extension of thought about 
creativity from the traditional focus on product to a new focus on human experience.

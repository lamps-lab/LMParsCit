Abstract
The unfolded(U)
folded(F) transition of a polypeptide chain is only marginally
stable, with the net free energy change favoring F being typically about 5 kcal/mol (≈
the strength of couple of hydrogen bonds). This small stability arises from a delicate
balance of large compensating contributions from hydration effects and intramolecular
interactions within the polypeptide chain. Understanding this balance is of principal
interest in understanding the molecular basis of forces stabilizing the protein and
computer simulations can, in principle, aid in this quest.
Computer simulations have advanced to a stage where in silico folding of small
polypeptides is now feasible, yet characterizing the hydration thermodynamics of
polypeptides larger than a few amino acids remains a daunting challenge. Indeed,
over the long history of molecular simulations there have been no calculations, till
recently, of the hydration thermodynamics of proteins within an all-atom description
of the solvent.
Building on the regularization approach to free energy calculations developed in
our group, we solve the problem of calculating the hydration thermodynamics of pro-
teins in all-atom simulations. These calculations are at a level of resolution that rival
what is normally possible for simple solutes such as methane. Our framework also has
the virtue of directly quantifying the hydrophobic and hydrophilic contributions to
hydration, contributions that are of fundamental interest in understanding the ther-
modynamics of protein folding. Using the regularization approach, we have studied

ABSTRACT
the coil to helix transition of model deca-peptides and the response of this transition
to thermal and chemical stresses.
A major finding of our analysis of the temperature dependent hydration of the pep-
tides is that signatures attributed to hydrophobicity have a hydrophilic basis instead.
Interestingly, these hydrophilic effects are dominated by the hydration of the peptide-
backbone. Further, the textbook picture of rationalizing hydrophobic hydration in
terms of specific water structures is shown to be implausible. On balance, in our
model systems intramolecular interactions are as important, if not more important,
than hydration effects in both the primary-to-secondary and secondary-to-tertiary
structure transition.
Examining the role of chemical stresses also provides surprises, while also broadly
supporting the importance of hydrophilic effects indicated by the temperature depen-
dent hydration behavior. The denaturants urea and GdHCl are found to strengthen
the hydrophobic effect for the primitive hydrophobe, a cavity that repels water, and
yet they denature proteins. Within the helix-coil model studied here, urea stabilizes
the coil over the helix by promiscuous hydrophilic interactions primarily mediated
by dispersion forces. GdHCl, on the other hand, unfolds the helix by destabilizing
it more than the coil, again by tilting the balance of hydrophilic contributions in
favor of the coil. TMAO alleviates primitive hydrophobic effects and yet it drives the
coil-to-helix transition, primarily by weakening the favorable hydrophilic hydration
of the peptide backbone.
Tracing the reasons for the current accepted dogmas on dominant forces leads us
to consider group-additive models, and these turn out to be Achilles’ heel in modeling
protein hydration thermodynamics: such models are fundamentally flawed in ignoring
solvent-mediated correlations between different residues on a polypeptide. These
correlations can lead to ascribing greater or lesser hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity to
the defined chemical group depending on the molecular context in which the group is
placed. We suggest abundant caution in relying on such group-additive approaches

ABSTRACT
for a many-body system with energy scales that can span many orders of magnitude.
This thesis, together with accumulating experimental evidence, calls for a rig-
orous reconsideration of the currently accepted dogmas regarding “dominant” forces
driving protein folding and hence also the mechanism of folding based on such dogmas.

3.2 Contributions to cexp from the temperature dependence of 〈Ereorg〉 and
the subcomponents of 〈Esw〉. For methane, the solute-water contri-
bution is listed under side-chain water. For the peptide, Eα is par-
titioned into backbone-water and sidechain-water contributions. The
net cexp does not sum exactly to the values noted in Table 3.1 because
the linear fits are not exact. All values are listed in cal/mol-K. . . . . 31

ground) are presented in the units of kcal/mole. No standard error in
kBT lnxc/pc is greater than 0.6 kcal/mol. All values are in kcal/mol. . 59

favorably (C0) and most favorably (C7) hydrated coil states. For the
helix and C0 states, results with partial charges turned off (indicated
by Q = 0) are also noted. Rg is the radius of gyration (relative to the
center of mass) and Rc is the end-to-end distance between terminal
carbon atoms in Å. SASA is the solvent accessible surface area in Å2.

the hydration contribution to the potential of mean force, Wsolv, as
the helices are brought from 14.5 Å to 9.5 Å. The change in hydra-
tion enthalpy, ∆hex, is further divided into ∆Ereorg, the change in
the water reorganization contribution, and ∆Esw, the peptide water
interaction contribution. The latter is subdivided into contributions
from the backbone-water interactions, ∆Ebb, and sidechain-water in-
teractions, ∆Esc. ∆X = X(9.5 Å) − X(14.5 Å), for all X. Standard
error of the mean is given in parenthesis at the 1σ level. The value of
Tsex(r = 14.5 Å) is explicitly given to emphasize that the entropy of

2.2 Quasichemical theory for molecular solutes. Solvation shell of a molecule
is a contour formed by many spheres, each centered on a heavy atom
of the solute. Figure taken and modified from reference 72. First a
cavity of the size and shape of the solute molecule is created (packing)
pushing away solvent molecules with the help of a field, then the so-
lute is put inside this cavity (long-range). Observe when long-range is
calculated there are no near neighbor contacts between solute and sol-
vent. In the end the solute is allowed to make near neighbor contacts
(by turning off the cavity) thus giving the strength of near neighbor
interactions. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 18
2.3 Cavity in pure water at 298 K and 1 bar. For comparison, cavity of zero

molecules close to the solute (shown in brown and red) have differ-
ent potential energy (average of interaction energy with the rest of the

6.1 The C0 (ξ = 36.8 Å, ∆µ
ex ≈ −7 kcal/mol) and C7 (ξ = 34.0 Å,
∆µex ≈ −14 kcal/mol) coil states have roughly the same W (ξ); ∆µex
are the all-atom hydration free energies (“QC solv”) relative to the
helix. The shaded regions correspond to the range of unfolding free
energies using an a posteriori correction for hydration of the vacuum
unfolding free energy. Self-consistent hydration using GB/SA suggests
a marginally lower unfolding free energy. Notice that the c36 forcefield
improves the balance towards the coil state. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 75
6.2 Components of the potential of mean force in bringing two helices
together. The helices are shown in green and the connecting yellow

along a linear polypeptide. The parallel (4) and antiparallel (©)
arrangements are also highlighted by the blue-arrow denoting the helix
dipole. Wsolv is the solvent contribution (open symbols), and Wsolv +
∆U (Eq. 6.1) is the net PMF (filled symbols). For r . 8 Å, there is
steric overlap between the helices and ∆U rises rather sharply. Data
including these values of ∆U are thus not shown. . . . . . . . . . . . 77

Introduction
Proteins are linear polymers of amino acids and are the hardware expression of the
genetic information embedded in nucleic acids. These molecules have been termed
“Nature’s robots” [1] and they animate life as we know it. For example, in higher
organisms, proteins are essential in fending off infections; in forming the elastic fila-
ments that underlie the action of muscles; in storing and transporting oxygen that is
then used in catabolic reactions, itself mediated by another set of proteins, to convert
biochemical energy (in organic nutrients) to the energy currency ATP; in capturing
photons to aid vision; ... Indeed, proteins are essential to all aspects of life [2–4].
To function properly, a protein must fold into a well-defined three dimensional
structure. (Quite remarkably, a class of polypeptides exists that remains natively
unfolded, but in response to environmental signals even these molecules acquire a
specific conformation to affect a given task [5]. We shall not be concerned with such
polypeptides in this work.) Proteins can misfold, but cellular systems appear to have
mechanisms to correct for this; importantly, it is now well-appreciated that misfolding
and aggregation of proteins itself causes many diseases [6]. Therefore, folding of a
protein into a specific structure is an indispensable process for living organisms.
An early breakthrough in understanding the folding of the polypeptide chain came
from Anfinsen’s pioneering experiments on the renaturation of fully denatured ribonu-

clease. These investigations lead to the thermodynamic hypothesis that in essence
implies that the unfolding 
 folding transition is an equilibrium phenomena: “ ...
the three dimensional structure of a native protein in its normal physiological milieu
(solvent, pH, ionic strength, presence of other components such as metal ions or pros-
thetic groups, temperature, and other) is one in which the Gibbs free energy of the
whole system is lowest; that is, the native conformation is determined by the totality
of interatomic interactions and hence by the amino acid sequence, in a given environ-
ment.” [8] The crux of Anfinsen’s work is the recognition that protein folding can be
treated by arguments of equilibrium thermodynamics. Anfinsen’s pivotal insight was
the observation that totality of interactions necessarily depends on the sequence and
hence the structure, too, necessarily depends on the sequence.
Inspired by these thermodynamic arguments, Levinthal became interested in the
conformational search problem – proteins fold within milliseconds despite a large
2
1. INTRODUCTION
number of possible conformations. With his thought experiment, he too, like Anfin-
sen, highlighted the importance of the totality of these interactions [9]. In his own
words, “ ... protein folding is speeded and guided by the rapid formation of local
interactions, which then determine the further folding of the peptide” (Ben-Naim
citing Levinthal [9]). We shall not be concerned with the kinetics of protein folding
in this work.
How these interactions speed and guide the folding process (their role in the
structure sequence relationship) is, in fact, often called the second half of the genetic
code [10]. This “code”, if known, will be of immense use. For example, knowing
this language can help speed the design of therapeutics to target specific proteins,
in developing effective ways to crystallize and/or store protein-based therapeutics,
in designing novel proteins with user-defined function, in designing other polymeric
systems that could be governed by similar principles ... the potential list of scientific
and technological possibilities appears limitless. It is perhaps for this reason that
efforts to understand protein folding have occupied such a central place in all of
biology, and biophysics.
1.1 The protein folding problem
Since Anfinsen’s insight, a broad quest in protein biophysics has been to predict the
structure from the sequence. This has led to what has been termed the protein folding
problem, a term that oftentimes subsumes distinct facets of efforts to understand the
unfolding 
 folding transition. These facets include: (a) understanding how the
sequence dictates the native state; (b) understanding how a protein finds its native
structure so quickly if the number of possible structures, for a given sequence, is huge;
(c) devising ways to predict the structure given the sequence.
In all facets of this problem, the solvent plays an important role, but its effect on
the unfolding 
 folding has often been estimated using rather strong assumptions
3
1. INTRODUCTION
and/or approximations. Reassessing the role of the solvent using a first-of-its-kind
framework that allows one to avoid making the strong assumptions and/or approxi-
mations made earlier is a principal achievement of this work. Our approach also calls
for a reconsideration of the current accepted ideas about dominant forces in protein
folding, and thus potentially also the mechanism of protein folding.
We next briefly review the extant ideas on the dominant thermodynamic forces
in folding and its role in the folding mechanism. (We borrow liberally from Tanford’s
book [1] summarizing historic developments in understanding proteins and protein
folding.) After this brief (but not exhaustive) summary we will present a broad
overview of our approach and contributions.
“Thermodynamic forces” popularly used to explain protein folding can be sepa-
rated in two broad but distinct categories: hydrophobic forces and hydrophilic forces.
Normally perceived, these “thermodynamic forces” are exclusive as they emerge from
a diverse set of atomic groups (see Figure 1.2 for surface diversity) within a protein.
1.1.1 Hydrophobic effects
The hydrophobic effect is a widely invoked “thermodynamic force” to explain
protein folding. The similarities amongst protein folding, oil/water demixing, micelle
formation, and surfactant adsorption on water surface have motivated researchers to
define a “thermodynamic force” that is common to all these phenomena.
The following properties give an impression of hydrophobic behavior: (a) solubility
so low that Henry’s law becomes applicable (positive excess chemical potential); (b)
further decrease in solubility with increase in temperature implying negative excess
entropy of hydration; (c) high and positive excess heat capacity of hydration (heat
capacity of hydration of hydrophobic solute is significantly more positive than the
heat capacity of the same solute in its pure form [11]); (d) clustering of hydrophobic
molecules in water (negative osmotic second virial coefficient). However, some solutes

and yellow) along with ionic residues (blue) are coated on a long chain of backbone
that can make hydrogen bonds with the solvent. Picture is only for the purpose of
demonstration and taken and modified from reference 12
that do not satisfy all four properties are still considered hydrophobic. For example,
Tetrahydrofuran is a water soluble compound, yet it is considered hydrophobic due
to (b) and (c), as no actual evidence of clustering of Tetraydrofuran molecules exists.
Nevertheless, these four properties define the uniqueness of oil and water demixing
and thus hydrophobic behavior.
The credit for recognizing the importance of hydrophobic effects goes to Isidor
Traube, who, in 1891, showed that the lowering of surface tension of a homologous
series of compounds depends on the length of the nonpolar chain [13]. The clear
inference was that the nonpolar tails preferentially partition to the air/water interface
5
1. INTRODUCTION
rather than be solvated in water. Similar ideas also led Danielli [14] to suggest
that proteins might fold to hide their nonpolar pieces from water. Later Langmuir,
who had previously used his understanding of hydrophobicity to explain soap micelle
formation, together with Wrinch [15], proposed an important role of hydrophobicity
in the protein folding. Contemporaneous studies on the solubility of nonpolar gases
in liquid water already revealed peculiar entropic and heat capacity signatures. Frank
and Evans [16] later rationalized these signatures by introducing the iceberg model.
This model hypothesizes that water forms cages or clathrate-like structures around
the small apolar solutes; in this model, the formation of the cage is used to rationalize
the negative entropy of hydration and the latent heat required to melt the cage with
the high and positive heat capacity of hydration. It was within this intellectual milieu
that Kauzmann [17] placed the hydrophobic effect at the center of the protein folding
problem and likened hydrophobic interactions to hydrophobic bonds that were formed
by the drive to librate water from the cages surrounding the nonpolar solute. (As
we shall note below, perhaps the then evolving understanding of the role of hydrogen
bonding in stability also biased Kauzmann’s view, but one that he continued to
champion till later in his life [18].) This picture going back to Frank-Evans and
Kauzmann is the canonical explanation found in textbooks to explain hydrophobic
behaviour and oil-water demixing.

1. INTRODUCTION
Later, Tanford used the then available data (with some approximations regarding
group additivity and chain entropy) and argued that the need to sequester hydropho-
bic residues from water can easily compensate for chain entropy that would drive the
polymer to unfold [19]; this further strengthened the case for hydrophobic hydration
in folding.
These works on the clustering of hydrophobic molecules appear to have led to a
pleasing and simple picture, the protein folding funnel [20]. In this model, Anfinsen’s
restatement of the second law of thermodynamics for proteins in a solvent is, often
contentiously [9, 21], interpreted as “free energy minimum of a protein” in a solvent
instead of “free energy minimum of the protein and the solvent” – a subtle yet
profound change. (We note, especially in attempts to deduce structure from sequence,
the role of solvent is usually relegated to a featureless continuum, and the discussion
focuses on the free energy minimum of the protein [22].) That the “protein folding
landscape” is shaped like a funnel and unfolded structures roll downhill (or collapse)
to stable native structures at the bottom of the funnel is explained by the drive of
hydrophobic groups to sequester in the interior of a protein, much like how soap
micelles form in water.

1. INTRODUCTION
Now, the hydrophobic effect and the folding funnel model are ubiquitously present
in biophysics textbooks and they are taught to students as standard explanations for
protein folding [23–30].
An important contribution of this thesis is to show that the structural interpreta-
tion of hydrophobic effects is not correct, and in fact the signatures of hydrophobic
effects can arise due to hydrophilic effects. Thus the very idea of oil-water demixing
as being relevant to the polypeptide chain collapse must be reconsidered.
1.1.2 Hydrophilic effects
Attractive interactions provide the cohesion that holds any material together,
and their role can be most readily appreciated in phase transitions such as melting
and boiling, non-ideal behavior of gases, non-ideal behavior of salts in solutions, etc.
However, their perceived role in the unfolding 
 folding transition of proteins has
waxed and waned. (Hydrophobic effects also provide an effective attractive force
between two nonpolar solutes, but the basis of this force, as noted above, is in the
behavior of the solvent. Hydrophobic bonds thus have an entropic origin, whereas by
hydrophilic effects, we emphasize the enthalpic aspect of interactions.)
The discussion of attractive interactions is facilitated, and the points (to be made
later in the thesis) further sharpened, by considering attractive interactions at dif-
ferent length-scales: (1) Long-range electrostatic interaction between charged groups
and between the charged groups and the solvent. (By long-range it is understood
that the residues are typically separated such that there is no possibility of short-
range hydrogen-bonding.) (2) Short-range hydrogen bonding interactions. In both
cases, dispersion interactions can play an important role, but this aspect has received
surprisingly little detailed treatment.
In protein solution thermodynamics, electrostatic interactions influence pH de-
pendent behavior, pH-regulation of enzyme activity, acid and alkaline denaturation,
8
1. INTRODUCTION
and protein substrate/inhibitor interactions [31]. The earliest efforts to understand
such effects goes to Linderström-Lang and his study of interaction between charged
residues on the basis of the the then newly developed Debye-Hückel theory [31].
Within this classical picture, since the electrostatic energy depends on the square of
the net charge, a view appears to have emerged that “no electrostatic contribution to
protein stability is expected near the isoelectric point” [32]. Thus long-range electro-
statics have typically been discounted in attempts to understand the dominant forces
in the unfolding 
 folding transition of proteins. But a protein with no formal net
charge still has partial charges and the interaction of these partial charges among
themselves and with the solvent can still contribute to stability, an aspect that, quite
surprisingly, remains underappreciated. (We return to this issue later in highlighting
the role of such interactions in the coil to helix transition.)
Turning now to short-range attractive interactions, in early attempts to explain
protein denaturation (when the three dimensional structures for proteins were yet
unknown), Mirsky and Pauling insightfully anticipated the role of attractive interac-
tions involving NH· · ·O=C pairs in stabilizing proteins. (These groups, of course,
constitute parts of the polypeptide backbone.) Pauling, together with Corey and
Branson, later ingeniously used the need to satisfy such hydrogen bonds to propose
two new structures of polypeptide chains, the alpha-helix and the beta-sheet, struc-
tures that were later confirmed by x-ray scattering. [2, 4]
The suggested importance of hydrogen-bonding likely spurred the quest to quan-
tify its role in stabilizing proteins. Using urea-urea pairing as a model for hydrogen
bond formation, Schellmann concluded that hydrogen bonds only provide a marginal
stability to proteins. (See Kauzmann’s review [17] and citation to Schellmann’s
work; as noted in the earlier section, this suggested weakness of h-bonding was an-
other likely reason in Kauzmann’s emphasis on the hydrophobic effect.) Klotz and
Franzen [33] came to a similar conclusion on the basis of free energy of pairing be-
tween N-methylacetamide molecules, and somewhat later, the hydrogen bond inven-
9
1. INTRODUCTION
tory argument (see equation 1.1, net gain in number of hydrogen bonds is zero after
unfolding) by Fersht [34, 35] also led to the notion that hydrogen bonds only provide
marginal (to non-existent) stability to proteins.

 NH· · ·water + water· · ·O = C

(1.1)
The efforts by Schellmann, Koltz and Franzen, and Fersht all rely on pairing be-
tween model compounds that are free to roam in a solvent to infer properties of such
bonds between groups that are otherwise anchored on a polypeptide chain. Besides
this, as Ben-Naim has highlighted [36], arguments such as the h-bond inventory (and
by extension similar counting arguments extant in the literature), are fundamentally
faulty in mixing hydration Gibbs energy with solute-solvent binding energy and ne-
glecting the fact that waters of hydration, even when they are released from the
solute, still remain at the same chemical potential (and hence their pairing or not
cannot contribute to a driving force as indicated in the stoichiometric equation 1.1)
Later, a decade after presenting the argument, Fersht himself became critical of
the oversimplification: “Although the hydrogen bond inventory is zero, hydrogen
bonding is energetically favorable in the formation of enzyme-substrate complexes
because of the increase in the entropy on the release of bound water molecules .[This
is analogous to] intramolecular reactions versus intermolecular reactions ... When two
molecules associate, they lose translation and rotational entropy, and this has to be
deducted from the energy balance on binding. But if they are already held together
in complex, there is no further loss of translational and rotational entropy if an extra
hydrogen bond is built in” [35].
(Theoretical and computational efforts [37–40] efforts to understand the role of
10
1. INTRODUCTION
hydrogen bonding in protein stability also provide an unclear picture. We can note
that even in the prototypical problem of helix to coil transition, using continuum
dielectric models of the solvent, one set of calculation suggested that hydrogen bonds
do not stabilize the helix [41] whereas another came to an opposite conclusion [42].)
Within the last 15 years, studies on the role of osmolytes in protein stability has
once again refocused attention on the importance of the role of attractive interactions,
in general, and hydrogen bonding, in particular, in protein folding [43, 44]. These
studies indicate that osmolytes affect protein stability principally by their action
on the peptide backbone; the inference is clear that this implies interaction of the
backbone itself must be important in protein folding. During about the same period,
Ben-Naim has helpfully emphasized the importance of all hydrophilic effects in protein
folding [45]. Further, experiments within the last few years have shown that, quite
remarkably, backbone itself can collapse (no oily residues necessary!) and fold a
protein [46].

the neighborhood. Lower level of structures are formed first. These structures later

related to the hierarchic assembly model
The importance of hydrophilic effects, especially the role of hydrogen bonds, natu-
rally suggests that local interactions along the polypeptide chain should be important
in folding. This suggestion finds its best expression in the hierarchic assembly model
of folding. (We emphasize that hierarchic assembly does not imply non-local attrac-
11
1. INTRODUCTION
tive interactions are not important [47, 48].) Indeed one of the important ideas of this
model is that local nucleation events could be stabilized by non-local interactions [49].
An aspect of such an effect can already be inferred from our study on the helix/coil
transition and the pairing of helices.
1.2 Overview
Experimental studies that seek a molecular rationalization of the observed thermo-
dynamics of protein folding invariably appeal to hydration of small molecule analogs
of the protein groups. In theoretical approaches to assess the thermodynamics of
hydration, the studies have typically focused on idealized models that seek to better
illuminate the physics under study, for example, for assessing the potential role of
hydrophobicity in folding, researchers have sought to understand the collapse of ide-
alized alkane chains. Often at the level of proteins, the solvent is usually described as
a featureless continuum [51, 52]. As Ben-Naim noted in 2011, no direct assessments
of the free energy of a protein in a solvent described in full atomistic detail existed
(but see 2012 work from our lab [62]).
While simulations of protein folding have matured, assessing the thermodynamics
of protein folding and the role of solvent in this process have been beset by one main
challenge: To calculate free energy of protein in a given conformation with fidelity to
the atomistic nature of the solute and the solvent while simultaneously segregating all
the contributions to the free energy (viz. hydrophobic, hydrophilic, electrostatic, etc.)
to uncover “thermodynamically dominant forces” in unfolding 
 folding transition
of proteins.
We have, for the first time in the history of this problem, succeeded in the effort
to meet this challenge by developing a computational framework to apply the quasi-
chemical theory of solutions to molecules as big as proteins. Thus it is now possible
to study the hydration thermodynamics of a protein in a given conformation at the
12
1. INTRODUCTION
same level of resolution that was formerly only possible for simple solutes such as
methane.
We will discuss our findings for thermodynamics of unfolding
 folding transition
of proteins using this framework in this thesis. We have organized the rest of the
thesis as follows.
We will introduce quasichemical theory of solutions and the framework we have
developed to implement it in chapter 2.
In chapter 3, we will study the hydration of deca-peptides in response to a thermal
perturbation. In chapter 4, we will study the transfer of deca-peptides from water to
an aqueous solution of osmolytes; here the protein thermodynamics is perturbed by
a solvent additive. The results of both chapters lead to surprising findings. The main
role of these perturbations is in modulating protein-solvent attractive interactions,
rather than the hydrophobic effect. If the temperature signatures of hydrophobic
effects as suggested by calorimetric experiments, are invalid for protein solvation,
then why did many studies support the hydrophobicity hypothesis?
In chapter 5, we will discuss the group additivity based assumption (the fundament
of many seminal studies that supported hydrophobicity hypothesis) to answer the
question why the hydrophobicity based hypothesis appeared successful. We will ask
two questions here: Are group additivity based calculations accurate? and, can group
additivity discover mechanism of protein folding? We will demonstrate that how
competing errors can cancel each other and give the illusion that group additivity
accurately calculates transfer free energies. We will show that hydration free energies
are not context independent and powerful near neighbor correlations, mediated by the
solvent, make group additivity ill suited to analyze the mechanism of protein folding.
Having established the importance of hydrophilic effects in folding and the po-
tential flaws in additive models, we apply our methods to explore the primary-to-
secondary (coil-to-helix) and secondary-to-tertiary (helix-helix pairing) transition in
a simplified, model system. (In chapter 6, we will take a deca-peptide and give rig-
13
1. INTRODUCTION
orous thermodynamic treatment to its folding sans any approximations.) This work
will highlight the importance of attractive interactions and build a convincing case
for protein folding being a delicate balance of attractive interactions instead of dom-
ination by hydrophobic effects. Additionally, we will show here that the long-range
non-specific attractive interactions play a non-trivial role in the stability of the ter-
tiary structure of a protein.
In chapter 7, we will conclude by summarizing our perspective about the role of
solvent in protein folding that we have developed after afore-mentioned studies. We
will also discuss promising future applications of our framework.

The first quantity on the right hand side is the ideal contribution to the chemical

the properties of the solute alone.
The second quantity on the right hand side, µex, known as excess chemical po-
tential, holds the key to understand the role of solvent in the chemical potential of
the molecule, as it is related to the solute-solvent interaction energy, . For a solute

2. THEORY AND METHODS
Unfortunately, this form of the potential distribution theorem (PDT) is useless
in computer simulations as the tail of the interaction energy distribution, P (), is
not well behaved (Figure 2.1). Fortunately, this statistical problem of ill-behaved
tails of interaction energy in the PDT can be regularized with the help of external
constraints [56–71]. This approach leads to a form of the quasichemical organization
of the PDT. We next present a brief overview of the quasichemical theory of solutions.

The open circles are the probability distribution without regularization. The filled
squares are the regularized distribution. The distribution after regularization is a
well behaved Gaussian model, a signifiant improvement over the distribution without
regularization. Figure taken from reference 68
The development here is based on our previously published paper [72].
2.1 Quasichemical theory
As Figure 2.1 shows, the long-tails reflecting high solute-solvent interaction en-
ergies limits the direct use of Equation 2.2 as these high-energy tails are never well-
sampled. Imagine now a field φR(r) centered on the solvent that serves to push the
16
2. THEORY AND METHODS
solvent away from the solute-solvent interface. As the solvent is pushed away, we
temper the high-energy solute-solvent interactions and the conditioned P () starts
approaching a Gaussian. This modified problem is now easier to solve because if P ()
is a Gaussian distribution (with mean 〈ε〉 and variance 〈δε2〉) then the integral in
Equation 2.2 simply reduces to 〈ε〉+ β
2
〈δε2〉 .
Now we need to account for applying the field, and this is done in both the absence
and presence of the solute in the solvent. (See reference 58 for rigorous derivations.)

Figure 2.2 provides a pictorial representation of the above equation. Here, − lnx0[φR]
is the free energy required to apply the field in the solute-solvent system: it reflects
the strength of the solute interaction with the solvent in the inner shell (naturally
because this quantity is obtained after pushing the solvent molecules away from the
solvent). − ln p[φR] is the free energy required to apply the field in the neat solvent
system: it reflects the intrinsic properties of the solvent. For φR modeling a hard ex-
clusion of solvent, − ln p0[φR] is precisely the hydrophobic contribution to hydration
[56, 61]. βµex[P (ε|φR)] is the contribution to βµex from long-range solute-solvent in-
teractions. In molecular dynamics simulations, we calculate − lnx0[φR] or − ln p0[φR]
simply by the work required to apply φR. This field φR, pushes the solvent molecules
away thus creating a cavity (see Figure 2.3).
After briefly sketching the quasichemical theory to calculate chemical potential
of a solute, we will now focus our attention to another quantity of interest, namely
the entropy of solvation. In the next section we will briefly present an approach to
calculate the entropy of hydration for an atomic solute. (The same framework, of
course, applies to molecular solutes as well.)

In the end the solute is allowed to make near neighbor contacts (by turning off the

in the solute-solvent system minus the average potential energy of the solvent in neat
solvent system. The solvent molecule close to the solute contribute the most to the
reorganization energy as their hydration shell is affected the most by the presence of
the solute, but farther away from the solute-solvent interface, we expect the potential
energy of a water molecule to be close to the bulk values. Note also that the solute-
solvent interaction contribution, Esw, can itself be decomposed due to contributions
from the backbone (Ebb) and the sidechain (Esc), in pairwise additive forcefields.
We will now present methods that are common to all our calculations used in our

The solvent was modeled by the TIP3P [110, 112] model and the CHARMM [114]
forcefield with correction terms for dihedral angles [113] was used for the peptides.
We apply atom-centered fields to carve out a molecular cavity in the liquid, in con-
trast to reference [62] where the external field evacuated a spherical domain around
the molecule. The functional form of the field is noted in Figure 2.3. To build the
field to its eventual range of R = 5 Å, we progressively apply the field, and for every
unit Å increment in the range, we compute the work done in applying the field using
Gauss-Legendre quadratures.

from the ending configuration of the previous point in the chain of states. For the

istry contribution, since solvent never enters R < 2.5 Å, we simulate R ∈ [2, 5] for
a total of 15 Gauss points. Separate calculations with a lower order Gauss-Legendre
quadrature and a trapezoidal rule (with R incremented in steps of 0.1 Å [62]) showed
that results are very well converged with the five-point quadrature (data not shown).
The long-range contribution µexn [P (ε|φR)] was obtained by inserting the solute [63]
in a cavity (with atom-centered radius R = 5 Å).

regularization for excess chemical potential also uses the same R). Water molecules
that satisfy 5.0 < R ≤ 8 Å are counted as second hydration shell and water molecules
that satisfy 8.0 < R ≤ 11.0 Å are considered part of third hydration shell.

Temperature signatures of
hydrophobicity are hydrophilic in
origin
Note: This chapter draws upon a manuscript titled “Some surprises in the tem-
perature dependent hydration of an oligopeptide: signatures of hydrophobic hydra-
tion have a hydrophilic basis” that is currently being circulated to other researchers
to obtain their comments prior to submission.
3.1 Overview
A direct assessment of temperature dependent hydration of model proteins shows
that signatures that appear to suggest hydrophobic hydration on the basis of simi-
lar signatures in small molecules (discussed in Chapter 1) have a hydrophilic basis
instead. Interpreting the negative entropy of hydration in terms of specific water
structures is also shown to be deficient. Thus translating notions of hydrophobicity
from small nonpolar molecules to model similar physics in proteins, an approach that
has been instrumental in the genesis of extant views on the role of hydrophobicity in
23
3. SIGNATURES OF HYDROPHOBICITY
protein folding, should be reconsidered.
3.2 Introduction
Oil and water do not mix under conditions of temperature and pressure that are
of most interest in biology. This phobia of non-polar solutes to dissolve in water, the
hydrophobic effect, has been suggested as an important [17], perhaps even the domi-
nant [18, 32, 146], thermodynamic driving force that causes an unfolded polypeptide
to fold into a globular structure with the majority of the nonpolar residues hidden in
the interior of the structure, away from the solvent [18, 32, 147].
Hydrophobic hydration of non-polar gases [11] is characterized by two distinct
temperature signatures: (1) the partial molar excess entropy of hydration is negative.
(Throughout this work excess quantities are defined for transfer from vapor to liq-
uid with solute density the same in either phase; the partial molar entropy implied
here is also the unitary or contact entropy noted by Kauzmann [17].); and (2) the
corresponding heat capacity increment upon hydration, the partial molar excess heat
capacity, is positive. The partial molar enthalpy of hydration is negative (favoring
hydration), but, on balance, the partial molar Gibbs free energy of hydration is pos-
itive. These temperature signatures are also observed for the transfer of a non-polar
solute from an apolar liquid to water, provided care is used in accounting for changes
in dilution upon hydration [17, 103].
Following Frank and Evans [16], the entropy and heat capacity signatures have
been usually rationalized by invoking some form of ordering in the layer of water
surrounding the solute [18]. This rationalization is intuitively appealing since induced
order suggests a negative entropy of hydration and the greater amount of thermal
energy to melt the ordered layer of water agrees with the positive heat capacity
increment on hydration. This is also the model of hydrophobic hydration that is
either implied or explicitly stated in modern textbooks [23–30]. .
24
3. SIGNATURES OF HYDROPHOBICITY
The hydration thermodynamics of small non-polar solutes and its structural ratio-
nalization suggests that pairing between two hydrophobes will be favored by entropy
gained upon release of water molecules. Drawing a parallel between this suggestion,
the substantial prevalence of amino acids with non-polar sidechains (and the phobia
of non-polar solutes to mingle with water), and available data on thermodynamics
of protein aggregation, hydrophobic hydration was originally suggested to be an im-
portant factor in protein folding [17]. (Around the same time the stabilizing role
of hydrogen bonds also came to be questioned (for example, reference 33), perhaps
further strengthening the case for hydrophobic hydration as a key factor in protein
stability.) A subsequent quantitative analysis of hydrophobic hydration in protein un-
folding [19, 148], albeit one using a group additive decomposition of the hydration free
energy into contributions solely from the non-polar parts of amino acid side chains,
suggested that the unfavorable (hydrophobic) hydration of the non-polar parts easily
balances the chain entropy gained upon unfolding, further supporting the importance
of hydrophobicity in folding.
Microcalorimetry has provided the most direct experimental information on the
temperature dependence of protein unfolding [95, 102] and hence on the possible role
of hydrophobicity. These studies clearly showed a positive heat capacity change upon
protein unfolding, a feature that was rationalized as arising mainly due to the heat
capacity increment from the exposure of hydrophobic residues upon protein unfold-
ing [102]. (The then available heat capacity data also correlated with the number
of nonpolar contacts in the proteins studied.) Importantly, for some of the proteins,
the temperature-dependent specific enthalpy and specific entropy of unfolding also
appeared to converge to a single value at a temperature around 110 ◦C [95, 102].
This feature hinted at a deeper regularity holding the protein structure together; in
conjunction with the heat capacity data, the importance of hydrophobicity again ap-
peared to be confirmed. However, later more extensive studies have questioned the
reliability of the convergence behavior [149]. A later analysis of the heat capacity
25
3. SIGNATURES OF HYDROPHOBICITY
data on the basis of group-additivity suggested that hydration of polar and aromatic
groups favor protein unfolding and overwhelm the stabilizing influence of hydropho-
bicity [116], but the validity of this inference is in doubt in light of the emerging
understanding of limitations of group-additivity (chapter 5).
Theoretical studies on the hydration of a cavity, an ideal or primitive hydrophobe,
have been instrumental in furthering the current understanding of hydrophobic hydra-
tion [56, 61, 127–129]. The hydration of such cavities naturally arises in our approach
to calculate the excess free energy. Experimentally the hydration of nonpolar solutes
is used to model hydrophobic hydration, but as we shall see below the hydration of
such solutes also requires one to consider solute-solvent attractive interactions, effects
that are properly classified as hydrophilic aspects of hydration.
The hydration of cavities crucially highlights the length-scale dependence of hy-
drophobic hydration [127–129]: the hydration thermodynamics of small solutes scales
with the solute volume, whereas for larger solutes it depends on the solute-solvent
interfacial area. (For our purposes, side-chain analogs for nonpolar sidechains belong
to small-solute category, polypeptides and globular proteins belong to the larger so-
lute category.) This observation raises the question whether translating small solute-
hydrophobicity to model hydrophobicity at the level of proteins using a group-additive
scheme is valid, a concern that is amplified by recent studies that question additivity
[72, 84, 122, 123]. Moreover, the temperature dependences of the small and large
length-scale primitive hydrophobic hydration are also expected to be different. For
small (2-4 Å radii) solutes, simulations [129] show (as is also seen in this work) that
the excess free energy increases with temperature for biologically-relevant tempera-
tures, whereas the converse is expected at the large scale regime described by the free
energy to create a vapor-liquid [150, 151] interface. Thus it remains unclear whether
heat-capacity increments seen in microcalorimetry can be attributed to hydrophobic
hydration of the newly exposed nonpolar groups.
Earlier theoretical work has greatly advanced our present understanding of hy-
26
3. SIGNATURES OF HYDROPHOBICITY
drophobic hydration, but even for the prototypical problem of coil-to-helix transition,
a detailed examination of the temperature-dependent hydration thermodynamics is
as yet unavailable. Here we use our approach to free energy calculations to study
temperature-dependent hydration effects in the classical problem of the coil-to-helix
transition in a deca-alanine peptide. Our work turns up a surprise: signatures that
are attributed to hydrophobicity arise instead from hydrophilic hydration, primarily
of the peptide-backbone.
Together with the the observation that oligoglycine can itself collapse [46, 53, 54],
experimental studies indicating the role of backbone-driven collapse of polypeptides
[46] and osmolyte-driven contraction of unfolded proteins [93, 152], our work then
suggests that we must reconsider the extant hydrophobic-collapse-based model of
protein folding, and indeed the current understanding of dominant forces in protein
folding.
3.3 Methods
In addition to the methods listed in section 2.3 on page 21, we follow the following
methods.
We model the helix and coil states of a deca-alanine peptide. The peptides were
modeled with an acetylated (ACE) N-terminus and n-methyl-amide (NME) capped
C-terminus. The extended β-conformation (φ, ψ = −154 ± 12, 149 ± 9) was aligned
such that the end-to-end vector lay along the diagonal of the simulation cell; the
helix was aligned with its axis along the x-axis of the cell. The initial structures were
energy minimized with weak restraints on the heavy atoms to relieve any strain in
the structure. The peptides were solvated in 3500 TIP3P [110, 112] water molecules.
The CHARMM [114] forcefield with correction terms for dihedral angles [113] was
used for the peptides.
For calculating hexα (and thus s
ex
α ) we adapted the hydration-shell-wise procedure
27
3. SIGNATURES OF HYDROPHOBICITY
as noted in section 2.3 of page 21. Apart from this hydration shell method, we also
calculated entropy of hydration directly from
sex = −
(∂µex
∂T
)
T,P
. (3.1)
For this, we performed simulations at 280 K, 290 K, 306 K, and 314 K in addition to
298 K. We used a straight line fit to calculate entropy from this. The two different
estimates of sex helped provide a check on the calculation of this rather difficult to
assess quantity.
3.4 Results
3.4.1 µex and hex versus T
Figure 3.1 (left panel) shows the temperature dependence of µex and hex for the
helix and coil states, while Fig. 3.1 (right panel) shows the same for methane. Ta-
ble 3.1 collects the estimates of Tsex obtained from Eqs. 3.1 and 2.4. It is readily
seen that within statistical uncertainties the agreement between these estimates is
very good. The uncertainty in using Eq. 2.4 is high primarily because of the uncer-
tainty in estimating hexα ; the uncertainty in using Eq. 3.1 is high because the small
uncertainty in the slope (Fig. 3.1) is amplified by the factor T .

For hydrated-methane at 298 K, the calculated entropy of −7 cal/mol/K from
temperature derivative of chemical potential or −11 cal/mol/K from Eq. 2.4 can be
compared with the experimental value of −16 cal/mol/K [108, 109]. In an earlier
study, with the SPC/E water model [115] and somewhat different parameters of
29
3. SIGNATURES OF HYDROPHOBICITY
methane, it was found that sex ≈ −15 cal/mol/K [71]. The poor numerical agreement
with the current simulation is likely due to limitations in both the current water model
and in the parameters of the solute. But, importantly, the sign of sexα is correctly
captured and the estimated Tsexα is in error only by a few kcal/mol.
The heat capacity of hydration for the proteins and for methane is positive (Ta-
ble 3.1). The experimental partial molar heat capacity of hydration at 298 K for
methane is about 55 cal/mol/K [108], somewhat lower than the simulated value. On
the other hand, experimentally determined enthalpy of hydration is about−2.7 kcal/mol
versus the −1.0 kcal/mol obtained in simulations. These deviations reiterate the lim-
itations of the water model and solute parameters.
We find that in the helix-to-coil transition the change in heat capacity is negative,
about −52 cal/mol/K. The negative sign is opposite to what is normally observed in
the unfolding of proteins [95, 102], but appears to be consistent with recent exper-
imental data [117] and simulations results of helix-coil transition interpreted within
the Zimm-Bragg [118] or Lifson-Roig [119] formalisms.
We conclude this section by emphasizing that the hydration of methane, a proto-
typical hydrophobe, and the peptides displays the two key signatures of hydrophobic
hydration [120]: sexα < 0 and c
ex
p > 0. The sign of the excess entropy is usually ratio-
nalized by invoking some sort of water structuring around the solute. The sign of the
heat capacity is then rationalized by suggesting that these ordered waters can absorb
heat to melt and become disordered. This model has guided much of the think-
ing about hydrophobic hydration and its role in protein folding (see section 1.1.1 on
page 4).
As we show below, a pictorial rationalization of the excess entropy and heat ca-
pacity of hydration in terms of ordering of water ignores the important role solute-
solvent attractive interactions, the hydrophilic effects, play in the observed temper-
ature dependence. To this end, we first consider the temperature dependence of
subcomponents of hexα and then, on the basis of the quasichemical decomposition, the
30
3. SIGNATURES OF HYDROPHOBICITY
temperature dependence of the subcomponents of Tsexα .
3.4.2 Temperature dependence of hex components
The average solute-water binding energy, 〈Eα〉, and the solvent reorganization,
〈Ereorg〉, are approximately linear in T . For the proteins, we further decompose 〈Eα〉
into contributions from the backbone and side chain, which also depend linearly on
T . Thus the appropriate cexp contribution (Table 3.2) is readily calculated.
Table 3.2: Contributions to cexp from the temperature dependence of 〈Ereorg〉 and
the subcomponents of 〈Esw〉. For methane, the solute-water contribution is listed
under side-chain water. For the peptide, Eα is partitioned into backbone-water and
sidechain-water contributions. The net cexp does not sum exactly to the values noted
in Table 3.1 because the linear fits are not exact. All values are listed in cal/mol-K.
Methane Helix Coil
Reorganization 60.0± 6.0 102.0± 51.0 −6.0± 79.0
Side-chain water 6.7± 0.7 47.0± 3.0 49.0± 2.0
Backbone water 188.0± 5.0 241.0± 4.0
For methane, the excess heat capacity of hydration is positive. Close to 90%
of the value is accounted for by the temperature dependence of the reorganization
term. As found before [71], the reorganization energy is positive. For an ordered
first hydration shell of water molecules, one would expect a negative reorganization
energy. The simulations suggest an absence of such a structure.
The heat capacity of hydration is positive for the helix and the coil states as well,
but different physics accounts for the observed magnitude. For the helix about 70%
of the heat capacity is accounted for by the temperature dependence of 〈Eα〉, the
hydrophilic contribution to hydration, and this proportion rises to essentially 100%
for the coil.
31
3. SIGNATURES OF HYDROPHOBICITY
3.4.3 Temperature dependence of sex components
In table 3.3 we present the chemistry, packing, and long-range contribution to the
excess entropy. For the R = 5 Å case, the sexα components were obtained from the
temperature derivative of the respective µexα components. To assess the sensitivity of
the results, we also sought sexα components for R = 3 Å. The R = 3 Å inner-shell
envelope hugs the molecular surface making the chemistry contribution to µexα zero.
The packing contribution is easily calculated as before, but it is no longer possible to
calculate the outer-term contribution using the Gaussian approximation. Since sexα is
independent of R, we infer sexα [outer] (R = 3 Å) from the calculated s
ex
α [pack](R = 3 Å)
and the value of sexα obtained from the R = 5 Å data.
Table 3.3: Contributions to Tsexα at T = 298.15 K from Eq. 3.1. The sum of the
individual sexα contributions does not add to precisely the same value as that from
the net µexα as a linear fit with respect to T of the subcomponents of µ
ex
α is only an
approximation. Since sexα is a state function, its value at R = 5 Å serves a reference
in estimating the value of sexα [outer] for R = 3 Å (indictated by ?). All values are
listed in kcal/mol.

Consider first the case of methane. For R = 3 Å, the hydrophobic contribution,
sex[pack], is negative, a result that has traditionally been interpreted in terms of
ordering of water molecules around the cavity, as a way for the water to satisfy its
hydrogen bonding. But the negative −1.5 kcal/mol arising from the interaction of
the solute with the solvent is decidedly due to solute-solvent attractive interactions.
32
3. SIGNATURES OF HYDROPHOBICITY
These difficulties become acute when we consider Tsexα [pack]+Ts
ex
α [outer] for R = 5 Å
case. The solute in this case is special in excluding water molecules up to a range R,
and sex for this solute is itself negative, challenging any structural rationalizations.
The comparison of methane with the helix and coil sharpens these observations.
For a single R = 3 Å cavity, sexα [pack] < 0, but for a union of such cavities that
conform to the helix or coil shapes, sexα [pack] > 0. We find that the net negative
sign of sexα arises from the hydrophilic contributions to µ
ex
α . In effect, with increasing
temperature, the effective solute-solvent attraction is made less favorable, elevating
µexα , h
ex
α , and −sexα .
3.5 Summary
Our study leads to several important conclusions. First, the hydration thermo-
dynamics of a small cavity (an ideal hydrophobe) is entirely irrelevant in inferring
the hydration thermodynamics of a macroscopic cavity; to wit, even the sign of the
excess entropy of hydration differs. Thus translating notions of hydrophobicity, be it
in experimental or modeling approaches, from small molecules (or small length scale)
to infer the hydrophobic hydration of a macromolecule is inappropriate. But this is
precisely the approach — particularly the peculiar temperature signatures in protein
unfolding and protein-protein association and its similarity in small molecular com-
pounds — that led to early suggestions on hydrophobicity as a potentially important
driving force in protein folding. Subsequent researches elevated hydrophobicity to the
status of a dominant force in protein folding, but a common theme in these studies is
the reliance on translating notions of hydrophobicity from the small length scale to a
protein.
Often entropy and disorder are used interchangeably. For thermodynamics of in-
terest in biophysics, such notions have merit when the system energy is a constant;
then one can talk of entropy in terms of arrangements of the constituent parts of
33
3. SIGNATURES OF HYDROPHOBICITY
the system. But when the system is undergoing volume changes (to keep pressure
constant) and energy exchange (to keep temperature constant), interpreting entropy
in terms of arrangements is not possible. This is, of course, just a standard result
of statistical mechanics, but one that is surprisingly overlooked in pictorial rational-
izations of the excess entropy of hydration. We show that both sexα < 0 and c
ex
p > 0
have a very simple explanation that does not require us to invoke water structuring
around hydrophobic groups. With increasing temperature the effective attractive in-
teraction of the solute with the solvent is weakened, elevating the excess chemical
potential of the solute: thus sexα < 0. Likewise, c
ex
p is positive because the excess
enthalpy of hydration also increases (becomes less favorable) with weakening of the
effective solute-solvent attraction. The sign of both these quantities is directly related
to hydrophilic effects and not due to hydrophobic effects.
We identify three factors that contribute to cexp > 0: backbone-solvent interac-
tions, side-chain solvent interactions, and water reorganization. The contribution of
the backbone-solvent and side-chain solvent interaction to hexα is negative, but in-
creases with temperature. The reorganization factor is positive and increasing with
temperature. For the peptides, changes in the the backbone-solvent contribution are
by far the most dominant contribution to cexp . Interestingly, the importance of back-
bone hydration suggested by our study is in consonance with the identification of
the importance of backbone hydration in explaining protein stability changes due to
added osmolytes. While the studies identifying the importance of backbone hydration
also rely on an additive model of free energy change in water to osmolyte solution
transfer, we have recently suggested a plausible explanation why the additive model
might work in that context (see chapter 5).
Lastly, our identification of hydrophilic effects in explaining sexα < 0 and c
ex
p > 0
also suggests a plausible explanation for cold denaturation. With decreasing tem-
perature, the hydration of the unfolded state is likely preferred over the folded state
because of hydration of the peptide backbone, which is found to be important based
34

on the cexp data.

Chemical stresses in protein
solutions modulate attractive
interactions
Note: This chapter draws upon a manuscript in preparation.
4.1 Overview
In efforts to understand the thermodynamic forces stabilizing a protein, recourse
has often been taken to modulate the solvent using denaturants. Interestingly, in
studies on adaptation of organisms to their environment, it was discovered that, in
the face of mechanical, thermal, and chemical stresses, all organisms actively tune
the solvent by synthesizing osmolytes to preserve protein structure. Studies within
the last 15 years have led to a thesis that osmolytes primarily act by changing the
solubility of the peptide backbone [43, 44]. In chapter 5, we will study the hydration
of a peptide unit in osmolytes, but here we illustrate the physical clarity of our frame-
work by studying the helix-coil transition of a model peptide in several osmolytes. A
broader consequence of our work is that attractive interactions are more important
36
4. PEPTIDE TRANSFER FREE ENERGIES
in protein solvation thermodynamics than the hydrophobic effect.
4.2 Introduction
In the Tanford transfer model, transfer free energies of peptides (transfer free
energy being free energy of transferring a peptide from water to aqueous solution
of osmolytes) are needed to interpret m-values (an indicator of relative stability of
protein conformations) of protein folding (Figure 4.1).

∆gtr, i ⇒ group transfer free energy
Figure 4.1: Tanford transfer model (figure taken and modified from reference [93]).
αi are surface area based factors intended to translate group transfer free energies,
(∆gtr,i), from model compounds to proteins.
The m-value interpreted within the group-additive decomposition of the transfer
free energy leads to the observation that denaturants and osmolytes tune protein
stability primarily by their effect on the protein backbone [43, 44]. Interpreting
these transfer free energies in terms of preferential solvation framework (protecting
osmolytes must partition away from the protein while denaturing osmolytes partition
37
4. PEPTIDE TRANSFER FREE ENERGIES
closer to the protein [81]) have also led to the “osmophobic effect” as yet another
thermodynamic force governing protein stability [94]!
Interestingly, a recent reanalysis of Auton and Bolens group-transfer free energies
by Moeser and Horinek [97] suggests that the group-transfer contributions calculated
by Bolen and coworkers were itself in error in ignoring role of concentration units, a
conclusion that while true likely does not change the transfer free energies relative to
glycine (Bolen/Pettitt; personal communication). Their reanalysis leads Moeser and
Horinek to conclude that the transfer of all groups (not just the peptide bond) from
water to aqueous urea is favored.
The group-additive model of m has greatly advanced the discussion of efforts to
understand the role of osmolytes in protein stability, but many aspects of the fold-
ing/unfolding of proteins in aqueous osmolytes remains puzzling. For example, urea
is known to raise surface tension but it can stabilize states of higher surface area (i.e.
unfolded states); trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) on the other hand lowers surface
tension but it stabilizes states of low surface area (i.e. the folded state). Other ex-
periments further contribute to the puzzle: Li and Walker have found that surface
tension plays a dominant role in protein folding in presence of osmolytes [87] but their
later experiments with temperature dependence showed signatures of hydrophobic-
ity [88]; here it should be noted that hydrophobicity and surface tension have different
temperature dependence.
Given the importance of protein denaturation, many computer simulation studies
have sought to explore the role of urea in protein unfolding. For example, simulation
study by Daggett and coworkers [89] suggests that the protein first swells in aqueous
urea and unfolds after subsequent penetration by urea into the protein. Thirumalai
and coworkers have explored the role of urea and over papers spanning a decade have
suggested that urea unfolds because of its role in electrostatics [90], in decreasing the
hydrophobic effect [91], and more recently by binding to the protein [92]. (We note
here that that given the role of urea in increasing the surface tension, one must expect
38
4. PEPTIDE TRANSFER FREE ENERGIES
urea to increase the magnitude of primitive hydrophobic effects.) Study from Pet-
titt’s group [98] supports the thesis that urea denaturation is more due to dispersion
interactions, but these simulations definitely suffered from convergence problems [99].
While a consensus appears to be developing for the role of urea (at least within
simulations), some of the puzzles noted above remain unresolved. Further, given the
obvious limitations of the group-additive model (chapter 5), a reexamination based
on our tools might prove helpful.
In an effort to understand the thermodynamics of protein solvation to resolve some
of these puzzles, in this work we will look how some cosolutes change solubility of a
few smaller peptides. We will later discuss its implications for protein folding. We
have studied effect of urea, TMAO and guanidinium hydrochloride on solubility of
smaller peptides using the framework developed in this thesis. Urea and guanidinium
chloride can denature a protein [75] while TMAO is known to refold a denatured
protein.
We will next discuss our simulation methods followed by results and discussion.
4.3 Methods
We take deca-glycine and deca-alanine in helical and coiled conformations. For
these peptides, we have calculated hydration free energies and solvation free energies
in aqueous solutions of TMAO, urea, and guanidinium hydrochloride. We will use
these to calculate transfer free energies of peptides.
While transfer free energies can easily give m-value of protein folding, calculating
the transfer free energy of the unfolded state requires thermal averaging over entire
ensemble of unfolded state; here we will take an extreme model of the unfolded state
(a fully exposed conformation). We also note a slight difference of notation that we
have followed in our thesis in the definition of m-value. m-values are defined for a 1
molar solution of the cosolute, but in our thesis we have not used 1 molar solutions.

For a solution, the m-values presented in this thesis are not based on one molar
solution basis but on the basis of actual concentration of that solution.
The TIP3P model of water [110, 112] is used and deca-peptides are modeled by a
CHARMM force field [114]. 340 TMAO molecules modeled by Kast force-field [79]
are present with 3500 water molecules to give an approximately 4 molar solution. The
approximate size of the box in this system if 51.86 Å. 783 urea molecules are mixed
with 3500 water molecules to make an approximately 8 molar solution of urea. The
size of the box in this case it approximately 54.36 Å. 500 molecules of guanidinium
hydrochloride are mixed with 3500 water molecules in a box of approximate size
54.48 Å to give an approximately 5 molar solution of GDCL. Urea and GDCL are
modeled by Kirkwood-Buff based fore-field of Weerasinghe and Smith [77, 78]. Rest
of the methods are as listed in section 2.3 on page 21.

tion
Figure 4.2 presents transfer free energies to the aqueous solution of TMAO.
The sign of transfer free energy is not uniform for all the peptides (osmophobicity
requires that transfer free energies be positive for all peptides to a solution of os-
mophobe like TMAO [94]). However, all discharged peptides have negative transfer
free energies hinting that the charge on the peptides should cause the non-uniformity
of peptide transfer free energy. Moreover, packing contributes to make the transfer
free energies negative (consistent with experimental observation on surface tension,
decrease in packing here is found to be proportional to surface area), long-range ef-
fects also contribute to make the transfer free energy negative. But, the short-range

attractive interactions (chemistry) is always positive for a fully charged peptide and
always negative for a discharged peptide. In fact, higher the exposure of the backbone
to the solvent, more positive the transfer free energy. Interestingly if the peptide is
discharged, TMAO will fail to stabilize the helical state of peptide. Thus TMAO must
act by “dialing down” [93] the short-range attractive interactions with the solvent.
In Table 4.1 we present the m-value of of the charged and discharged peptides

allowed by discharging the peptide, then TMAO can not refold it. In fact, for a
discharged peptide, TMAO has a tendency to unfold. And we have seen in Figure 4.2
and Table 4.1 that TMAO “weakens” local attractive interactions. Our suggestion is
that TMAO acts by “weakening” the short-ranged electrostatic interactions between
the the peptide and the solvent; backbones-solvent interactions are likely to contribute
significantly as a side-chain has zero electrostatic interaction with the solvent.
4.4.2 helix-coil transition in aqueous-urea solution
Figure 4.3 collects the free energies of transferring deca-glycine and deca-alanine
from water to urea. Unlike aqueous-TMAO, aqueous-urea has consistent effect on
transfer free energy: it stabilizes the peptides, and it stabilizes coiled states even
more.
Moreover, urea increases hydrophobic effect. But, urea also enhances short-range
attractive interactions and long-range van der Waals .
Using these transfer free energies, we calculate the m-value in aqueous-urea. These
values are listed in Table 4.2. As is expected of an osmolyte that increases hydropho-
bicity, the contribution of the hydrophobic effect to the m-value is toward folding the
peptides. But, attractive interactions also contribute significantly. However, quite
surprisingly the effect of long-range non-specific van der waals in the m-value is not
insignificant – i.e. urea has a preference for a conformation even when it is not allowed

Urea is a better denaturing agent for discharged peptides (Table 4.2). In fact,
when charges are turned on, urea becomes poorer denaturing agent for the same
peptide. Thus, urea denatures a protein purely by dispersion interactions, these
dispersion interactions come from both the backbone and side-chain.
Rather interestingly, if alkanes are to be taken as models for hydrophobic effect,
then urea which strengthens the hydrophobic effect must protect the helical state for

of discharged peptides. Thus, alkanes are not good models to study hydrophobicity,
because they too have attractive dispersion interactions with the solvent.
4.4.3 helix-coil transition in aqueous-GdHCl solu-
tion
We present transfer free energies in Figure 4.4. Interestingly for an osmolyte
that acts as a denaturing agent, transfer free energies are positive. Guanidinium hy-
drochloride (GdHCl ) raises chemical potentials by increasing packing contribution.
Experiments have shown that GdHCl increases surface tension. Besides, increasing
surface tension, GdHCl also has attractive interactions with the peptide. These at-
tractive interactions are higher for a discharged peptide. Additionally, long-range
attractive interactions with the peptide are better in GdHCl as compared to pure
water.
Comparing the transfer free energies of helical and coiled peptides, we learn GdHCl
is a better unfolding agent for discharged peptides. In fact, chemistry of a discharged
peptide is more negative than the chemistry of a fully charged peptide. We suggest
that GdHCl unfolds proteins by dispersion interactions. This suggestion has been
made before us [80].

4.5 Summary
The role of long range dispersion interaction is often neglected in transfer free en-
ergy and m-value calculations [93]. But we have seen here, that long-range dispersion
interactions play significant role in transfer free energies and m-value. However, long-
range electrostatic interactions are not modulated by any of the osmolytes studied in
this work.

Besides the neglect, the range at which various attractive interactions are active
is also misunderstood in the literature. It is assumed that dispersion interaction are
short ranged and osmolytes should come close to the peptide in order to have better
dispersion interactions [98]. Similarly, it is also assumed that because electrostatic
interactions are long-range, a change in long-range attractive interactions will mean
a change in electrostatic interactions. Our results differ. Dispersion interactions con-
tribute significantly to long-range attractive interactions and they can be modulated
by osmolytes. We find that osmolytes can change dispersion interactions even when
they are beyond the first hydration shell of the solute – dispersion interactions are
short ranged between two molecules, they are not short ranged between a molecule
and a big bath of molecules. (A quick estimate for interaction between a molecule
and a big bath of molecules: the integration of 1
r6
term of dispersion interaction is
performed after multiplying it with a 4π r2dr term; the latter term is monotonically
increasing in r.)
The backbone based theory [43, 44] suggests that osmolytes primarily act on the
backbone, osmolytes that fold a protein raise chemical potential of both the native and
unfolded state, and osmolyte that unfold lower the chemical potential of both native
and unfolded state. This theory is not entirely supported by our work. We observe in
the case of TMAO, though it acts via backbone based mechanism, all conformations
did not see a rise in chemical potential. We observe in the case of urea that unfolding
46
4. PEPTIDE TRANSFER FREE ENERGIES
is a consequence of promiscuous interactions by urea. And we observe in the case
of guanidinium hydrochloride that osmolytes that denature a protein can also raise
chemical potential of protein’s conformations. Broadly, our work finds that attrac-
tive interactions are more important in protein solution thermodynamics than the
hydrophobic effect – chapter 3 also highlights importance of attractive interactions.

5.1 Overview
In Chapters 3 and 4, based on the framework we developed, we showed distinct
limitations and/or flaws in the canonical explanations of the physics of protein hy-
dration. Since the earliest studies on proteins, including techniques implicit in several
modern approaches to model protein hydration [19, 43], the thermodynamics of pro-
tein hydration (or solvation) has been obtained by using a group-additive scheme
(Figure 5.1).
Here we explore this approximation first for a hydrophilic group (the backbone)
and then hydrophobic group (butane-analog). We uncover subtle, but consequential,

flaws in this group-additive approach. Our work thus suggests much caution needs
to be exercised in using such group-additive approaches to model protein solution
thermodynamics and the mechanism of protein folding.
5.2 Introduction
The group-additive decomposition of the unfolding free energy of a protein in an
osmolyte solution relative to that in water poses a fundamental paradox: whereas the
decomposition describes the experimental results rather well, theory suggests that
a group-additive decomposition of free energies is, in general, not valid. In a step
towards resolving this paradox, here we study the peptide-group transfer free energy.
We calculate the vacuum to solvent (solvation) free energies of (Gly)n and cyclic
diglycine (cGG) and analyze the data following experimental protocol. The solvation
free energies of (Gly)n are linear in n suggesting group-additivity. However, the slope
interpreted as the free energy of a peptide unit differs from that for cGG scaled
by a factor of half, emphasizing context dependence of solvation. But the water-
49
5. GROUP ADDITIVITY
to-osmolyte transfer free energies of the peptide unit are relatively independent of
the peptide model, as observed experimentally. To understand these observations,
a way to assess the contribution to the solvation free energy of solvent-mediated
correlation between distinct groups is developed. We show that linearity of solvation
free energy with n is a consequence of uniformity of the correlation contributions, with
apparent group-additive behavior in the water-to-osmolyte transfer arising due to
their cancellation. Implications for inferring molecular mechanisms of solvent-effects
on protein stability on the basis of the group-additive transfer model are suggested.
Moreover, the hydration thermodynamics of the amino acid X relative to the ref-
erence G (glycine) or the hydration thermodynamics of a small molecule analog of
the sidechain of X is often used to model the contribution of X to protein stability
and solution thermodynamics. We consider the reasons for successes and limitations
of this approach by calculating and comparing the conditional excess free energy, en-
thalpy, and entropy of hydration of the isoleucine sidechain in zwitterionic isoleucine,
in extended penta-peptides, and in helical deca-peptides. Butane in gauche confor-
mation serves as a small molecule analog for the isoleucine sidechain. Parsing the
hydrophobic and hydrophilic contributions to hydration for the sidechain shows that
both these aspects of hydration are context-sensitive. Further, analyzing the solute-
solvent interaction contribution to the conditional excess enthalpy of the sidechain
shows that what is nominally considered a property of the sidechain includes entirely
non-obvious contributions of the background. The context-sensitivity of hydrophobic
and hydrophilic hydration and the conflation of background contributions with ener-
getics attributed to the sidechain limit the ability of a single scaling factor, such as
the fractional solvent exposure of the group in the protein, to map the component
energetic contributions of the model-compound data to their value in the protein. But
ignoring the origin of cancellations in the underlying components the group-transfer
model may appear to provide a reasonable estimate of the free energy for a given
error tolerance.

5.3 Protein backbone
The thermodynamics of protein unfolding in the presence of aqueous osmolytes
(small organic co-solutes) is of fundamental interest in understanding the forces sta-
bilizing the folded protein and in the broader quest to understand how biological
systems adapt to environmental stresses by changing the solvent properties.
Experimental investigations on the molecular role of the osmolytes on the ther-
modynamics of protein unfolding are usually anchored by
∆GNU = ∆G
(0)
NU +
∑
i
αi∆gtr,i , (5.1)
where ∆GNU and ∆G
(0)
NU are, respectively, the experimentally accessible unfolding free
energies of the protein in the osmolyte solution and in water. (For a 1 M osmolyte
solution, ∆GNU−∆G(0)NU is the m-value; here we follow the sign-convention of Ref. 93.)
Drawing upon the studies by Tanford and coworkers, ∆GNU−∆G(0)NU is partitioned
into water-to-osmolyte solution transfer free energy ∆gtr,i contribution due to group
i, potentially allowing one to understand the role of the solvent at the level of each
individual group. Typically, the groups include the peptide unit and the side-chains
of the amino acid residues, and the ∆gtr,i contributions are obtained from chemically
apposite model compounds. The factor αi accounts for the fractional change in the
degree of solvent-exposure of group i in going from the native (N) to unfolded (U)
state.
The pioneering experimental studies by Bolen and coworkers interpreted using
Eq. 5.1 leads to an important insight: both conformation-protecting and denaturing
osmolytes exert their influence primarily by changing the solubility of the peptide
backbone [93, 94], an identification with significant consequences to our understanding
of protein folding [43, 44]. However, these results pose a paradox: whereas the group-
additive decomposition in Eq. 5.1 is, in general, not valid, ∆GNU −∆G(0)NU calculated
using Eq. 5.1 together with reasonable approximations of the unfolded state of the
51
5. GROUP ADDITIVITY
protein describes the experimental ∆GNU − ∆G(0)NU rather well. Towards resolving
this paradox, here we examine the vacuum-to-solvent and water-to-osmolyte solution
transfer free energies of the peptide group and its dependence on the choice of model
compounds.
Glycyl-peptides, (Gly)n, are a common model for the peptide unit. Using blocked
glycyl peptides and by carefully minimizing peptide-peptide interactions in peptide
solubility, Auton and Bolen [74] have sought the peptide group transfer free energy,
∆gtr,p, that is “independent of the model compound and the choice of concentration
scale”. In their studies, ∆gtr,p was obtained by appropriately combining the transfer
free energy of chains of various lengths n, and, somewhat more robustly, by equat-
ing ∆gtr,p to the slope of the transfer free energy with respect to n, the so-called
constant increment method. Model independence was demonstrated by showing that
the transfer free energies based on (Gly)n agree with those from cGG, the cyclic-
diglycine molecule. This concordance, while pleasing, is puzzling as well, for in cGG
the CO and NH of the peptide are cis and the molecule has a net zero dipole moment,
whereas the CO and NH are trans, and the peptide dipole moment non-negligible, in
the (Gly)n system. Thus, either the conformation of the peptide is unimportant in
∆gtr (Eq. 5.1) or there are other factors that lead to this result or a combination of
both.
To test the group-additive transfer free energy model for peptides, a recent all-
atom simulation study examined the free energy of (Gly)n (n = 2 . . . 5). In this study,
both the vacuum-to-water and the water-to-osmolyte solution transfer free energies
were reasonably linear with n, an observation that was used to conclude in favor of
group additivity. (No attempt was made to study cGG and thus also verify model
independence.) However, using a continuum dielectric model of the solvent, Avbelj
and Baldwin [153, 154] have argued against group additivity. For example, they find
that in an (Ala)9 chain, the electrostatic contribution to the hydration free energy
of peptide unit as well as its interaction with other peptide units depends on the
52
5. GROUP ADDITIVITY
location of the chosen peptide unit. As we shall show below, the preceding seemingly
contradictory conclusions from the earlier studies can be reconciled; and this recon-
ciliation depends on appreciating that an independent group additive contribution to
the hydration free energy is not a consequence even when the conditions for use of
the constant increment approach are satisfied.
Here we use theory and computer simulations to examine the solvation free en-
ergies of acetyl-(Gly)n-methyl amide peptides and of cGG. The free energies are
obtained by a quasichemical organization of the potential distribution theorem as
discussed in section 2.1 on page 16. A virtue of this formulation is that it makes
transparent the role of correlated fluctuations of the binding energies of two groups
on the molecule and its role in the thermodynamics of hydration. We show that
even for an idealized solute that is incapable of making any close (near-neighbor)
contacts with the solvent, the group-solvent binding energies between neighboring
groups are correlated and make a non-negligible contribution to the net solvation free
energy. This implies that identifying a model independent, group-contribution to the
solvation free energy is, in principle, not possible, even for this idealized solute. The
situation for a real solute is bound to be considerably more complicated.
Group additive behavior in the solvation free energy can be suggested if solvent-
mediated correlation between different groups are similar for a series of model com-
pounds, such as (Gly)n, but the identified group-additive free energy will necessarily
depend on the chosen model. Importantly, such correlation effects arise at different
energy scales: within the quasichemical formulation it is found for the idealized solute,
a collection of hard-spheres, and for the physical solute. However, group additivity in
the water-to-osmolyte solution transfer free energy can arise if these correlation con-
tributions cancel, but then care is needed in inferring mechanistic conclusions about
solvent effects on stability from such an apparently group-additive model.
We will now review methods that we have employed in this study in addition to
the methods listed in section 2.3 on page 21, after this we will present results of this
53
5. GROUP ADDITIVITY
study.
5.3.1 Methods
The peptides are modeled in the extended configuration with the long axis aligned
with the diagonal of the simulation cell and the center of the peptide placed at the
center of the simulation cell. (Initial configurations were energy minimized with
restraints to keep the peptide extended.) The peptide atoms are held fixed throughout
the simulation. The solvent was modeled by the TIP3P [110, 112] model and the
CHARMM [114] forcefield with correction terms for dihedral angles [113] was used
for the peptide. A total of 2006 TIP3P molecules solvated the peptide. Parameters
for urea and TMAO were obtained from Refs. 77 and 79, respectively. A total of 449
urea molecules (for a molar concentration of about 8 M) and 195 TMAO molecules
(for a molar concentration of about 4 M) were used.
The long-range contribution µexn [P (ε|φR)] was obtained by inserting the solute in a
cavity (with atom-centered radius R = 5 Å). 1500 equally spaced cavity configurations
were obtained from the last 0.375 ns of a 1 ns simulation at R = 5 Å. (The starting
configuration for the R = 5 Å simulation was obtained from the endpoint of the
Gauss-Legendre procedure as in section 2.3 on page 21.) The binding energies for the
correlation analysis were obtained from the solute extraction procedure.
Cyclic-diglycine was built and optimized using the Gaussian (G09) quantum chem-
istry package [111]. For consistency with the (Gly)n simulations, the partial charges
and Lennard-Jones interaction parameters were obtained from the backbone atoms
of the CHARMM forcefield.
5.3.2 Results
The excess free energies of solvation (as well as packing, chemistry, and long-range
contributions) are linear in the peptide chain length in all the solvents studied here.

The water-to-aqueous osmolyte transfer free energy agrees quite well for both the
(Gly)n and cGG models. The urea concentration is about 8 M and assuming a linear
dependence of transfer free energy on osmolyte concentration [39, 75], we find that
for 1 M urea solution, the transfer free energy is −50 ± 13 cal/mol, a value that is
in good agreement with the experimental estimate of −43 ± 10 cal/mol [74]. We
find a net zero transfer free energy to aqueous TMAO solution (4 M), in contrast
to the experimental estimate of 87 cal/mol [74], a discrepancy that is likely due to
inadequacy in the forcefield model for TMAO [39, 76].
From Table 5.1 we can note that the good agreement between (Gly)n and cGG in
water to aqueous osmolyte transfer free energy masks the rather poor agreement in
transfer free energies from vacuum to the respective solution. While it can be argued
that water-to-osmolyte solution transfer is the most relevant experimentally, from the
perspective of a physical theory, the vacuum-to-solution transfer quantities have the
virtue of highlighting the role of inter-group correlations transparently.
To further illuminate the model dependence of the transfer free energies (Ta-
ble 5.1), we consider how these values are used in modeling the m-value. As Eq. 5.1
55
5. GROUP ADDITIVITY
indicates, the transfer free energies are scaled by the fractional solvent exposure of the
group relative to that in the model compound [152]. Using commonly used atomic
radii [155–157] for calculating solvent accessible surface area (SASA), we find that the
SASA of the CONHCH2 group in cGG is about 1.5 times that in the (Gly)n model.
(The SASA of the peptide in cGG is obtained by dividing the SASA for the entire
molecule by 2. For the (Gly)n model, the change in SASA with n gives the SASA per
peptide.) Thus relative to (Gly)n, the transfer free energy per unit area of the model
compound is nearly 33% smaller in magnitude for the peptide in cGG. In the context
of the m-value, using the peptide from cGG as a model can lead to both quantitative
and qualitative errors.
Now, to understand the mechanistic aspects in a transfer free energy, we will
first start by analyzing binding energies for a simple system, later we will study
hydrophobic and short ranged attractive contributions.
5.3.2.1 Correlations in long range binding energies
Imagine a polymer that has n units, the binding energy (ε) of this polymer is
summation of binding energies of all the units (ε =
∑n
i εi, where εi is the binding
energy of the unit i ∈ (1, n).) Similarly, variance of the binding energy of that polymer
can also be written in terms of the variance and covariances in the binding energy of
the constituent units. (

We present decomposition of long-range contribution to the outer term in Ta-
ble 5.2 following Equation, 5.2. Two things are clear from this table: correlation with
the neighbors is non-zero in all solvents; correlations with neighbors are the same for
all solvents. The formers renders group additivity invalid (because contributions are
context, near neighbor, dependent) while the latter suggests why group additivity ap-
pears to be valid in peptide transfer free energies. As this simple system is transferred
from one solvent to the other, these correlations cancel.
5.3.2.2 Correlations in packing and chemistry
Bayes’ rule provides a method for identifying correlations in packing and chem-
istry (both of these are related to probabilities). If we break the polymer into a
distinguished group i and the rest (here denoted as background), then the probabil-
ity of observing a cavity of the size of the peptide, x0, is related to the probability of
observing a cavity of the size of the distinguished group, x0(i), and the probability of
observing a cavity of the size of the background, x0(iback), by
57
5. GROUP ADDITIVITY
x0 = x0(i · iback) = x0(i)x0(iback)xc. xc is the correlation contribution here. xc can
then be evaluated from x0, x0(i) and x0(iback). We obtain x0(i) and x0(iback) using
the same method as was used for x0. Similar, analysis can be performed for packing
too.
To demonstrate correlations in packing, we only pursue urea and water. TMAO
is left out because of very small difference between packing in TMAO and packing in
water. We present, correlations contribution in packing for two different chain lengths
in Table 5.3. We take middle of the chain as the distinguished residue and rest as
background in both the cases shown in the Table 5.3.
Table 5.3: Correlation contributions in packing. p0, p0(i), and p0(iback) mean packing
for peptide, packing for distinguished residue and packing for background, respec-
tively. i refers to the distinguished residue which is the middle residue of the chain.
A peptide with n = y has y + 1 peptide units. No standard error in −kT ln pc is

Notice that correlation contribution, −kT ln pc, is non-zero for both water and
urea. But more strikingly, correlation contribution in water and correlation contri-
bution in urea is not the same! Perhaps the most surprising consequence of this is
that correlations in transfer of simple cavities from water to urea do not cancel and
additivity does not hold even in the transfer of these simple solutes.
Why, then, does additivity appear to hold? The answer lies in chemistry.
In Table 5.4, we present packing plus chemistry. Presenting packing and chemistry

Observe, in Table 5.4, how the correlation contributions (correlations in packing
plus correlations in chemistry) are the same for both urea and water. Thus while
additivity does not hold for solvation free energies but it does appear to hold in the
transfer free energies. We note that additivity appears to hold in transfer free energies
because correlations at two separate energy scales (packing effects are fundamentally
different from chemistry) cancel each other.
We saw that there are nontrivial context dependent solvent mediated correlations
in solvation free energies that render group additivity invalid. Besides the context
dependence of correlations, completely different energy scales have competitive corre-
lations that largely cancel in transfer from one solvent to other. But this cancellation
of correlation arises from disparate energy scales, and cautions us against interpreting
any mechanism of protein folding with the help of group additivity. These context
dependent correlations of binding energy are not limited to the first hydration shell
of a polymer, in context dependent correlations persist in simplest of cases such as
solvation of hydrophobic cavities and long-range non-specific solute-solvent binding
59
5. GROUP ADDITIVITY
energies.
After discussing the limitations of group transfer free energy model for the most
numerous group of a proteins i.e. the backbone, we now turn our attention to the side-
chains. As the hydrophobic effect is often suggested to be the standard explanation
for protein folding, we have studied a hydrophobic group (isoleucine) here.
5.4 Hydrophobic side-chain
The hydration thermodynamics of analogs of amino acid sidechains (or of amino
acid sidechains in small model peptides) have often been used to understand protein
folding and protein-protein association. Tanford [19] formulated this approach into
a quantitative, predictive framework. In his approach, the free energy of unfolding
is given as a sum of the free energy of transfer of “the small component groups of
the molecule, from the environment they have in the native form, to the environ-
ment they have in the unfolded form”. Accounting for subsequent refinements that
included corrections for the solvent-exposure of the “small component groups”, equa-
tion 5.1 is applied to calculate the unfolding free energy (∆GN→U). In interpretation
of calorimetric data [116], for example, a gas-phase reference is natural, as is also the
case in this section.
At a time when theory, simulations, and experimental techniques were less de-
veloped than they are now, the group-additive approach was a pragmatic first step
to understand the hydration thermodynamics of a complicated macromolecule. But
it is also important to assess its limitations and probe if the physical conclusions
based on this approach are valid. For example, the group-additive model appears
to capture the effect of osmolytes rather well [152], with the predicted and experi-
mentally determined m-values agreeing to within a couple kcal/mol for proteins with
about 100 residues. Further, our earlier study on the solvation of a peptide group
[72] showed that in the water-to-osmolyte transfer solvent-mediated correlations be-
60
5. GROUP ADDITIVITY
tween peptide units (in Glyn) cancel and this allows one to identify a peptide-group
transfer free energy that is model independent. But in the vapor-to-liquid transfer,
a situation where solvent-mediated correlations are preserved, the identified group-
additive contribution (∆gi, Eq. 5.1) depends on the model used to define the peptide
group. Several recent studies have explored the limitations of the additive model
[72, 84, 122, 123]. While our work [72] emphasized solvent-mediated correlations,
König et al. [84, 123] have emphasized the role of “self-solvation” [159] in limiting ad-
ditivity. In exploring context dependence of hydration, these authors also suggested
how adding a methyl group to an amino acid changes the solvent-exposure of the
peptide backbone thereby influencing the excess free energy in a way that cannot be
captured by sidechain analog data. Building on these efforts, here we study how well
a model of the sidechain describes the hydration of the sidechain in the context of a
protein. In particular, our aim is to better understand factors limiting additivity and
the reasons why scaling model-compound data to describe its properties in a protein
context may not be satisfactory. To aid in parsing energetic differences, we study
the conditional solvation of an isoleucine residue, often regarded as very hydropho-
bic [160], in the context of model extended and helical peptides. Butane in the gauche
conformation, matching exactly the sidechain conformation of isoleucine in extended
peptides, is used as a small-molecule analog of the sidechain.
Here we use the quasichemical approach to separate the hydrophobic (packing)
contributions from the hydrophilic contributions to both facilitate the calculation
and also provide insights into the limitations of additivity. These components (but
not the net free energy) do depend on the specification of a hydration shell, but the
approach has nevertheless provided important insights into the physics of hydration
and in generating models of molecular solutions
We complement the quasichemical analysis with the traditional decomposition of
the excess free energy into its enthalpic and entropic contributions. The quasichemi-
cal approach helps better appreciate how the context influences the hydration of the
61
5. GROUP ADDITIVITY
solute, while the enthaly-entropy decomposition leads to the finding that non-obvious
contributions from the reference (the context) get folded into the conditional contri-
bution attributed to the sidechain (the solute) that is of first interest in additive
models.
5.4.1 Methods
The pentapeptides GGGGG, GGIGG, and IGGGG are modeled in the extended
configuration with the long axis aligned with the diagonal of the simulation cell and
the center of the peptide placed at the center of the simulation cell. Helical deca-
glycine (G9G) and a helical peptide with nine alanine and one glycine at position
6 (A9G) serve as references for the helical peptides, G9I and A9I, respectively. All
peptides had an acetylated (ACE) N-terminus and an n-methyl-amide (NME) C-
terminus. In the helical peptides, isoleucine was substituted at position 6, approxi-
mately in the center of the helix. Butane in the gauche conformation was built using
the isoleucine conformation in the extended pentapeptide.
The solvent was modeled by the TIP3P [110, 112] model and the CHARMM
[114] force field with CMAP correction terms for dihedral angles [113] was used for
the peptide. A total of 2006 water molecules solvated the pentapeptide; 3500 water
molecules were used for the helical peptides. The Lennard-Jones parameters for
the isoleucine sidechain were used for g-butane. Since Cβ in isoleucine becomes a
CH2 group in g-butane, the partial charges of that center were slightly adjusted to
account for the presence of a capping H-atom. We note that CHARMM does have a
parameter set for butane. In particular, the parameter we use for Cβ is very slightly
shifted from the parameter values for the corresponding carbon atom in butane. Our
parameterization was motivated by our desire to be as close to isoleucine as possible,
but this minor shift in parameters is not expected to change any conclusions.
The G9G and A9G peptides were built from a helical deca-alanine. These struc-
62
5. GROUP ADDITIVITY
tures were energy minimized with weak restraints on heavy atoms to prevent large
distortions of the helix. (After energy minimization, the solute atoms are held fixed
for the remainder of the simulation.) The G9I and A9I helices were built by grafting
the conformation of isoleucine in the GGIGG system onto position 6. Thus the in-
ternal conformation of the isoleucine is the same in both g-butane, GGIGG, and the
helical peptides.
The free energy calculations and error analysis follow the procedure described in
section 2.3 on page 21. Briefly, φR is applied such that R varies from 0 and 5 Å.
For every unit Å, a five-point Gauss-Legendre quadrature rule defines the R points
sampled. The work to apply the field is then obtained by quadratures. At each gauss-
point, the system was equilibrated for 0.5 ns and data collected over the subsequent
0.5 ns. For the extended peptides, the long-range contribution was obtained by
performing particle insertion calculations in the appropriate molecular-shaped cavity.
Water with the appropriate cavity was simulated for 1 ns and 1250 frames from the
last 0.625 ns used for analysis. For the helical petides, given their high dipole moment
we made the conservative choice of obtaining the electrostatic contribution to the long-
range interaction using a 2-point Gauss-Legendre quadrature [161]; the van der Waals
(vdW) contribution was obtained using particle insertion in the molecular cavity.
Electrostatic self-interaction corrections (of about 0.5 kcal/mol) were applied [72].
(For the helices, the sum of the vdW and quadrature-based electrostatic contribution
deviates by about 1 kcal/mol from the Gaussian model, but this deviation is significant
at the statistical resolution of the chemistry and packing contributions.)
For the zwitterionic isoleucine and glycine we obtained the free energy in two
stages. First, the excess free energy of the completely discharged amino acid was
obtained using the quasichemical procedure. Then the work required to turn-on the
charges was obtained using a 3-point Gauss-Legendre quadrature. The 3-point rule
gave the same answer (within 0.1 kcal/mol) as the 2-point rule, but these estimates
deviate by over 10 kcal/mol from the linear-response result.
63
5. GROUP ADDITIVITY
The excess energy was obtained by adapting the shell-wise calculation procedure
(section 2.3). For calculating the excess energy we equilibrated the solvated peptide
system an additional 1.5 ns (beyond what was used in the free energy calculation),
and propagated the trajectory for an additional 3 ns, collecting data every 500 ps
for a total of 6000 frames. Entropies obtained using Eq. 2.4 agree within statistical
uncertainty with entropy calculated using −∂µex/∂T .
5.4.2 Results
Conditional hydration free energy of a molecule XH in the polymer MX is the
hydration free energy of MX subtracted by the hydration free energy of MH. Similar
definitions are used for conditional entropies and conditional enthalpies of hydration.
While the free energy of hydration is calculated by the regularization scheme,
enthalpy hydration is calculated by the shell based scheme. Entropy is then calculated
by excess free energy and enthalpy of hydration.

In Table 5.5, we present conditional hydration free energy of iso-leucine for zwit-
terionic glycine, subscript 0 indicates a hypothetical amino acid for which partial
charges are turned to zero. Notice that the free energy of converting a zwitterionic
glycine is the same as the free energy of hydrating a butane. But mutating a hydrogen
to butane is easy for a fully discharged amino acid compared to mutating a hydrogen
of a fully charged peptide. The reason for this is not the hydration of butane (because
exposed surface area of butane is the same in both the cases) but the screening of par-
tial charges of the background by butane. Thus in mutating to an iso-leucine context
also goes through a change. This can be seen in the conditional solute-solvent bind-
ing energies. When the peptide is discharged the conditional change solute-solvent
binding is more negative compared to conditional solute-solvent binding energy when
the peptide is fully charged.
Next, we mutate a fully extended pentapeptide GGGGG to GGIGG and IGGGG,
the results are shown in Table 5.6. First, notice that even though exposed surface
area of butane and background is approximately same, the hydration free energies of
GGIGG and IGGGG are different – same surface area does not guarantee same hy-
dration free energies. Secondly, note that not only does the surface area based scaling
fail to capture physics of conditional hydration, no single surface area correction is
possible that can capture all aspects of the physics.
In Table 5.7, we present the conditional hydration free energies in a helical con-
formation. We mutate 6th residue of a deca-glycine and another deca-peptide (with a
glycine at 6th residue and rest alanines) to isoleucine. This gives us the conditional
hydration free energies of butane in the helical conformation for these two peptides.
We again find that the surface area scaling can not capture the conditional hydration
free energies and the physics of conditional hydration. In fact in this case sign of the
conditional solute-solvent binding energies is also estimated wrong.
We calculated conditional hydration free energies of butane and compared it with
the prediction from surface area based scaling of hydration free energy of butane. We

find that the conditional hydration of butane also changes the context; again, no single
area scaling factor can capture all the aspects of hydration thermodynamics of the
proteins. When a glycine is mutated to iso-leucine the binding energy distribution of
the background also goes through a change because of this mutation. Thus caution
must be taken in interpreting physical mechanism of protein folding using group
transfer free energies.
5.5 Summary
We have analyzed the group transfer free energy model for the solvation thermo-
dynamics of a hydrophilic group (the backbone) and a hydrophilic group (butane-
analog). We find that this assumption has serious limitations in interpreting the
thermodynamics of protein solvation.

Group transfer free energy model assumes that each residue interacts indepen-
dently (in the absence of correlations between two any residues) with the solvent.
This assumption is violated in all the cases studies here – neighboring residues do
influence solvent binding with each other. We have found nontrivial near neighbor
solvent mediated correlations between two residues of protein in this work. These
correlations make the group additivity based assumptions unsuitable to interpret sol-
vation thermodynamics.

Helix-coil transition in
deca-peptide models
Note: This chapter draws upon a manuscript that is currently being circulated
to other researchers for comments prior to submission to a peer reviewed journal.
6.1 Overview
In chapter 3 and chapter 4 we showed that thermodynamics of protein hydration
is different from widely accepted explanations. We found in chapter 5 that those
earlier explanations were based on an assumption that is ill suited to interpret pro-
tein hydration thermodynamics. In this chapter, we will take a prototypical case
of helix-coil transition and study it using quasichemical theory to better understand
mechanism of protein folding.
We calculate the hydration free energy of a deca-alanine peptide in the α-helix
and several coil states using a quasichemical organization of the potential distribution
theorem. Hydrophobic (packing) effects favor the compact folded states, as expected.
Surprisingly, this effect is outweighed by attractive protein-water interactions that
favor the coil states: hydration favors the unfolded state, suggesting that protein
68
6. COIL-TO-HELIX TRANSITION
intramolecular interactions are decisive in forming the helix. In the pairing of two
helices, packing outweighs short-range attractive protein-water interactions and drives
helix pairing. However, long-range attractive protein-water interactions, that are
sensitive to the relative orientation of the helices, can further enhance or reverse this
trend. The decomposition of free energies into entropic and enthalpic components
shows that change in entropy drives helix-pairing, but change in enthalpy, primarily
arising from changes in attractive protein-solvent interactions, opposes helix pairing.
In helix-pairing as well, changes in protein-protein interaction energy are found to be
as important as solvent effects.
6.2 Introduction
The α-helix is a fundamental secondary structural element in folded proteins,
making the understanding of forces stabilizing this structure of pre-eminent interest
in the broader quest to understand the thermodynamic driving forces underlying
protein folding [121]. Within the currently available molecular mechanics approaches
it is fairly straightforward to assess the role of peptide-intramolecular interactions in
the formation of the secondary structures. However, assessing the role of the solvent
in this process still remains a challenge.
Here, we use the regularization approach to free energy calculations to study
hydration effects in the classical problem of the coil-to-helix transition in a deca-
alanine peptide. In addition, we also study the pairing of two helices as a simplified
model of secondary-to-tertiary assembly. Our models of primary-to-secondary and
secondary-to-tertiary folding also allows us to investigate how the thermodynamic
driving forces originating in hydration effects behave at different length scales.
We find that hydrophobicity is not consequential in the formation of a secondary
structure, but it does play a substantial role in the helix-helix complexation. Long-
range interactions that have traditionally been regarded as unimportant in the ther-
69
6. COIL-TO-HELIX TRANSITION
modynamics of folding, especially for proteins at the isoelectric point [32], are shown
to play a nontrivial role in protein hydration, coil-to-helix folding, and helix-helix as-
sembly. Finally, changes involving peptide intramolecular interactions are also impor-
tant, both in folding and in assembly. Importantly, we find that no single contribution
can be ignored in assessing the thermodynamics of folding.
Experimental studies of solvent effects at the scale of a protein, for example in
the molecular interpretation of calorimetric data [116], typically appeal to group-
additive approaches that simulations [72, 73, 84, 122, 123] now reveal to have sig-
nificant limitations. Simulation studies seeking hydration thermodynamics — free
energy of hydration and its derivatives — at the scale of a protein still largely ap-
peal to coarse-grained descriptions of the solvent [52]. Using such methods, including
lattice models of protein folding that implicitly account for solvent effects in the po-
tentials, past studies have come to substantially differing conclusions about solvent
effects in the coil-to-helix transition: some have suggested that hydrophobicity drives
folding [41, 124], while others have emphasized the role of favorable electrostatics [42].
We will next present our simulation methods followed by results.
6.3 Methods
In addition to section 2.3 on page 21, the following completes the methods for this
chapter.
The deca-alanine peptide was modeled with an acetylated (ACE) N-terminus and
n-methyl-amide (NME) capped C-terminus. The extended β-conformation (φ, ψ =
−154±12, 149±9) was aligned such that the end-to-end vector lay along the diagonal
of the simulation cell. We label this coil state as C0. The helix was aligned with
its axis along the x-axis of the cell. The initial structures were energy minimized
with weak restraints on the heavy atoms to relieve any strain in the structure. The
peptides were solvated in 3500 TIP3P [110, 112] water molecules. Version c31 of the
70
6. COIL-TO-HELIX TRANSITION
CHARMM [114] forcefield with correction terms for dihedral angles [113], was used
for the peptides. We also compute the free energy of unfolding the protein in vacuum
using the adaptive-bias force (ABF) approach [125, 126]. From this trajectory, we
sampled nine structures with end-to-end distances between terminal carbon atoms
ranging between 28 Å and 36 Å in increments of 1 Å. We label the coil states from this
unfolding simulation {C1, . . . , C9}. The φ, ψ for these unfolded states predominantly
populate β and PPII regions of the Ramachandran plot. Structures were held fixed
in the hydration studies.
The same set-up is used to investigate helix pairing. We consider the potential of
mean force (PMF), W (r) along, r, the separation between the helix axis with the axis
parallel to each other. Additionally, we consider two relative orientations of the helix
dipoles, parallel and antiparallel. (Note that the helix dipoles will be antiparallel in
the simplest helix-turn-helix motif.) These arrangements help illuminate the role of
long-range protein-solvent interactions in helix-helix complexation. The PMF
W (r) = Wsolv(r) + ∆U(r) , (6.1)
where Wsolv is the solvent (or indirect) contribution [71] and ∆U is the contribu-
tion from direct protein-protein interactions relative to the proteins infinitely apart.
Wsolv(r) = µ
ex(r) − 2µex, where µex(r) is the hydration free energy of the pair of
helices (for a given separation and orientation) and µex is the hydration free energy
of an individual helix. We calculated ∆U using the same forcefield as that used in
the dynamics.
We also sought the enthalpic and entropic decomposition of Wsolv(r) using the
shell-based scheme (section 2.3).

6.4 Results
6.4.1 Coil-to-helix transition
In Table 6.1 we collect the results of the free energy calculation on the helix state,
the C0 coil state and the most favorably hydrated of the coil states in {C1, . . . , C9}.
(The least favorably hydrated coil state is C0 itself.)
Table 6.1 indicates that at least for the coil states considered here, the packing is
somewhat insensitive to the peptide structure. At the scale of the cavities, we expect
the packing contributions to scale with surface area [127–129] and the data in the
table conforms to this expectation. Since the solvent-accessible surface areas of C0
and C7 are not very different, despite overall differences in the structure, we expect
the packing contribution to be similar for these states, as found in simulations. The
packing contribution favors the helix state by about −40 kcal/mol: hydrophobic hy-
dration greatly favors the compact state of the protein. The chemistry contribution
72
6. COIL-TO-HELIX TRANSITION
is, however, in the opposite direction. It favors the C7 coil state by −57.7 kcal/mol
and the C0 state by −51.9 kcal/mol. Thus the local protein-solvent interaction out-
weighs the packing contribution by between 11 kcal/mol to 18 kcal/mol in favoring
the coil state, a conclusion that is invariant to the choice of physically realistic R
(Table 6.2). These favorable local protein solvent interactions arise primarily from
favorable peptide backbone (CONHCα)-water interactions (Table S.I); the Q = 0
results emphasize that both dispersion and electrostatic effects are important for as-
sessing backbone-water interactions.

Table 6.1 also highlights that attractive solute-water dispersion interactions can
drive helix-to-coil transition in a peptide that lacks partial atomic charges. This sug-
gests that we must reevaluate the relevance of the poor solubility of nonpolar solutes
— observe that both the helix and coil have a positive µex — in rationalizing the col-
lapse of a polypeptide. Our observation that hydration does not explain the collapse
of a nonpolar chain is consistent with the observation of similar behavior in alkanes
(cf. Ref. [130] and the reanalysis of data in Ref. [131] presented therein). Interest-

ingly, attractive solute-water interactions also oppose the pairing of the prototypical
hydrophobe methane [71].

Protein-solvent long-range interactions contribute a substantial fraction — roughly
between between 50% and 82% — of the net hydration free energy of the peptide.
In the coil-to-helix transition, the long-range contributions favor the helix by about
−4.0 kcal/mol (Table 6.1), primarily driven by changes in electrostatic interactions,
as might be inferred given the high dipole moment of the helix (Table 6.3). The
totality of all these hydration contributions still favors the coil state by between 7
and 14 kcal/mol. Thus the net attractive peptide-water interactions outweigh the
hydrophobic driving force and favors the unfolded state of the peptide.
Past simulation studies on the helix-coil transition have typically interpreted the
results within the framework of the Zimm-Bragg or Lifson-Roig formalisms [118, 119,
132, 133]. These studies have provided insights into the enthalpic and entropic con-
tributions to helix formation as well as reveal limitations in forcefields. However,
all-atom simulations parsing hydration contributions in the helix-coil transition ap-
pear to be scarce. A recent study found that hydration favors the coil state by about
19 kcal/mol [98], qualitatively consistent with this work. (The structure for the coil
and the forcefield parameters used are different from that here.) In that study, the
free energies were decomposed into electrostatic and van der Waals contributions, in
74

6. COIL-TO-HELIX TRANSITION
water is still predicted to be strongly favored by between −15 = (14 − 29) kcal/mol
and −22 = (7 − 29) kcal/mol. (The ABF-based estimate of the coil-to-helix free
energy change with self-consistent account of hydration, albeit with the continuum
GB/SA model [140–142] of the solvent, gives a value of about −13 kcal/mol.) The
corresponding range is −16 to −6 kcal/mol with the recently updated c36 version
[143] of the CHARMM forcefield and a value of about −8 kcal/mol with the GB/SA
model. (The c36 version improves the helix-to-coil balance relative to c31, as expected
based on the aim in designing this forcefield.)
Based on experiments on similar short peptides [135–139], such a strong drive to
form a helix in deca-alanine is not suggested. This suggests that the forcefield model
is deficient and biased towards the helical state, consistent with the earlier observation
by Best and Hummer [144] based on their analysis of NMR J-coupling. Unfortunately,
based on our results we cannot infer which aspect of the forcefield is deficient. Based
on our limited comparison between C31 and C36 variants of the CHARMM forcefield
and earlier studies (cf. [119, 144]) that show that minor tuning of protein dihedral
potential can improve agreement with experiments, we suspect that the strong drive
to a helix likely reflects problems with the intra-molecular energy function. Further,
the nonbonded solute-solvent interactions have typically been parametrized and ex-
tensively tested against hydration thermodynamics of small molecules [145] and this
part of the forcefield is thus expected to be more reasonable.
We expect the role of hydration in unfolding the helix to hold for larger chain-
lengths, provided the coil states are such that the backbone remains accessible to
solvent. Since coil-to-helix transition is seen in peptides with as few as 13 residues
[137], assuming the solute-solvent interaction model is reasonable, our results suggest
that folding of the helix is driven primarily by changes in protein intra-molecular
interactions, an inference that is in consonance with enthalpy changes driving helix
formation [136].

that hydration opposes the complexation of helices in the antiparallel orientation.
Our results thus suggest that hydration would oppose formation of the commonly
found helix-turn-helix motif. Interestingly, the direct contributions (∆U) can out-
weigh the hydration effects to drive complexation. (These direct contributions in-
volve non-bonded electrostatics and van der Waals contributions; hydrogen bonding
effects that are commonly invoked in folding is subsumed in these effects.) In the
antiparallel arrangement favorable ∆U drives complexation, whereas for the parallel

energy of complexation is roughly −2 kcal/mol, a small magnitude relative to the
large competing hydration and inter-molecular interaction effects.
Parsing the hydration contributions shows that in contrast to the coil-to-helix
transition hydrophobic hydration drives helix-helix complexation (Fig. 6.3). But long-

range interactions play an entirely nontrivial role in the complexation process. The
antiparallel arrangement of the helices is strongly disfavored by loss of favorable long-
range solute-solvent interactions in hydration, while the inhibition is more modest for
the parallel arrangement of helices. Importantly, irrespective of helix orientation, the
net hydrophilic contribution given by the sum of the chemistry and long-range con-
tributions disfavors helix pairing (Fig. 6.3, right panel); as expected, this conclusion
is insensitive to the choice of a meaningful R. Parsing the long-range interaction into
van der Waals and electrostatic components shows that this inhibition is solely due
to electrostatic interactions (Figure 6.4).

Figure 6.4: Long-range van der Waals (left) and electrostatic (right) contributions in
helix pairing.
Parsing Wsolv into its enthalpic and entropic components also proves illuminating
(Table 6.4). The change in the hydration entropy favors helix pairing for both the
configurations, but the characteristics of the change in reorganization and interaction
components emphasizes the need for caution in interpreting this change in terms of
specific changes in water structure. (For r = 14.5 Å, the excess entropy is negative,
but the reorganization contribution is positive, an observation that is not readily ra-
tionalized within the classic iceberg picture of hydrophobic hydration.) The change in
hydration enthalpy disfavors helix pairing for either arrangement of the helices. For
the antiparallel configuration, the change in the water reorganization energy favors
helix pairing. But this change is overwhelmed by the loss of backbone-solvent and
sidechain-solvent interactions, that is the hydrophilic contributions. For the parallel
arrangement, the change in the water reorganization contribution is approximately
zero, but helix pairing is once again inhibited by the solute-solvent interaction con-
tributions. Emphasizing the importance of electrostatic interactions between the
backbone and the solvent, the backbone-solvent contributions are sensitive to the
orientation of the helices, but the sidechain-solvent contributions are similar.

6.5 Summary
Our study leads to several important findings. One, hydrophilic hydration opposes
both coil-to-helix folding and secondary-to-tertiary transition, here modeled by the
pairing of two helices. The latter model does ignore the role the loops connecting the
helices play in the pairing, but it does suggest itself as a reasonable starting point to
understand solvent effects in tertiary structure formation.
Two, hydrophobic effects tend to favor the compact state of the polypetide and
favor both the coil-to-helix transition and helix-helix complexation. But in the coil-
to-helix transition, hydrophilic effects (protein-water attractive interactions) easily
overwhelm the hydrophobic contribution and favor unfolding of the peptide. Even for
a discharged peptide, essentially a nonpolar chain, attractive solute-solvent dispersion
interactions suffice to favor the helix-to-coil transition.
Three, in the pairing of helices, a phenomena occurring at a larger length-scale
80
6. COIL-TO-HELIX TRANSITION
than the coil-to-helix transition of a single peptide, hydrophobic effects do out-
compete the short-range peptide-water interactions in favoring helix complexation.
But in this case, too, the long-range protein-solvent attractive interactions, especially
for the antiparallel arrangement of helices, outweighs the net effect of the packing
plus short-range attraction contributions to favor the disassembly of the helices.
Four, in both the coil-to-helix transition and in the pairing of the helices in the an-
tiparallel orientation of the helix dipoles, we find that changes in the intra-molecular
energy of the protein is essential in shifting the balance to the folded state. This
intra-molecular interaction is primarily due to van der Waals and electrostatic inter-
actions. (Within the forcefield, all effects of hydrogen-bonding are subsumed in these
interactions.)
The limitations of the models and forcefield notwithstanding, our study suggests
that in protein folding hydrophilic effects and protein intra-molecular interactions are
as important as, if not more important than, hydrophobic effects.

Conclusions and future directions
In the study of unfolding 
 folding transition of proteins, experimentalists have
relied upon small molecule data while simulation studies have analyzed the thermo-
dynamics of hydration (excess free energy, entropy, and enthalpy) for objects as large
as proteins, only in the cases where the solvent is treated as a featureless continuum.
We are not aware of any theoretical study that calculates thermodynamics (free en-
ergy) of protein solvation while doing justice to the atomistic nature of the solute
and the solvent. The achievement of this thesis has been to make these calculations
routine.
With the help of these calculations, we have found, hydrophilic effects dominate
the hydrophobic effect in the formation of secondary structures; for the tertiary struc-
ture formation the hydrophobic effect does play a substantial role but at that length-
scale physics of hydrophobic effects is governed by the surface tension of the solvent,
not by the conventional picture of “hydrophobic bond” suggested by Kauzmann.
In our study on the deca-alanine peptide we have found all the signatures of
hydrophobicity (Chapter 3), but further analysis of these signatures led us to conclude
that their origin is in the hydrophilic effects. This suggests a fundamental flaw in
our interpretation of the hydration free energies. In fact, in another study, we had
found that the common method used to interpret hydration free energies (the group
82
7. CONCLUDING DISCUSSIONS
additivity based scheme) has some limitations (Chapter 5). This thesis suggests that
caution must be exercised in translating small molecule data to a molecule as complex
as protein; in a protein, nontrivial correlations between the sidechain, backbone, and
solvent do not allow a perfect translation of small molecule data.
For osmolyte effect on protein solubility (Chapter 4), our work finds that solute-
solvent attractive interactions are more important in protein solubility than the hy-
drophobic effect. Our work supports a broader range of hydrophilic effects. In the
role of long-range, dispersion interaction plays significant role in transfer free ener-
gies and m-value. In the short-range, we observed TMAO acts via a backbone based
mechanism while urea acts via promiscuous attractive interactions with the protein.
Moreover, the important role of dispersion interactions becomes clear in the case of
guanidinium hydrochloride as it unfolds proteins with the help of dispersion interac-
tions.
We later treated the helix-coil transition using our framework (Chapter 6). This
study leads to several important findings. One, hydrophilic hydration opposes both
coil-to-helix folding and secondary-to-tertiary transition, here modeled by the pair-
ing of two helices. Two, hydrophobic effects tend to favor the compact state of
the polypetide and favor both the coil-to-helix transition and helix-helix complexa-
tion. But in the coil-to-helix transition, hydrophilic effects (protein-water attractive
interactions) easily overwhelm the hydrophobic contribution and favor unfolding of
the peptide. Even for a discharged peptide, essentially a nonpolar chain, attrac-
tive solute-solvent dispersion interactions suffice to favor the helix-to-coil transition.
Three, in the pairing of helices, a phenomena occurring at a larger length-scale than
the coil-to-helix transition of a single peptide, hydrophobic effects do out-compete
the short-range peptide-water interactions in favoring helix complexation. But in
this case, too, the long-range protein-solvent attractive interactions, especially for
the antiparallel arrangement of helices, outweighs the net effect of the packing plus
short-range attraction contributions to favor the disassembly of the helices. Four, in

both the coil-to-helix transition and in the pairing of the helices in the antiparallel
orientation of the helix dipoles, we find that changes in the intra-molecular energy of
the protein is essential in shifting the balance to the folded state. This intra-molecular
interaction is primarily due to van der Waals and electrostatic interactions.
The limitations of the models and forcefield notwithstanding, this thesis sug-
gests that in protein folding, hydrophilic effects and protein intra-molecular
interactions are as important as, if not more important than, hydrophobic
effects.

A recent study [162] on peptide conformational switching has shown that a muta-
tion in just one out of 45 amino-acids of a sequence can lead to dramatic changes in
fold and function (Figure 7.1). Such conformational switches (involving small number
of mutations) are appealing candidates to understand the role of solvent in the the
sequence-structure relationship as a small change in the amino-acid sequence (thus
small change in the protein’s interactions with itself) can bring a noticeable differ-
ence in the hydration structure of the protein. It is at this point the framework
developed in this thesis can be helpful, as no other presently existing techniques can
calculate hydration free energies of proteins with the kind of atomistic details needed
to understand the role of solvent in protein conformational switches.
As a starting step, we suggest a simple cycle (akin to Hess’s law) involving hy-
dration free energies. For the purpose of illustration we will denote the proteins by

7.1.2 Osmolytes and quasichemical theory
Here we will show that our framework can be further developed to transpar-
ently understand the role of osmolytes in protein hydration thermodynamics. In our
framework, chemical potential is written as summation of packing, chemistry and
long-range contribution. Because long-range contribution is a result of well behaved
gaussian distribution, the role of osmolyte and water can be easily segregated in the
long-range. Here, we will discuss the chemistry contribution. (These equation can
also be written for packing contribution. As for a big enough cavity size the physics
of packing contribution approaches the physics of surface tension, these ideas can also
be extended to understand the role of surfactants in changing surface tension with
the help of experimental data.)

Notice the physical meaning of the first term on the right hand side. This is the
dilution contribution. Physically it is related to the transfer of a n water cluster from
water to osmolyte solution. Let’s denote this by xdilution.

Notice the second term on the right hand side. This this is the related to the free
energy of inserting cosolute molecules in a n water cluster. Let’s denote this by xinsert
Then
x0
x00
= xdilution × xinsert (7.15)
All these quantities can be calculated using our regularization scheme (as a test,
we have already calculated them for a few cases). Notice that we have finally parsed
the chemistry contribution to transfer into physically imaginable quantities.

8.1 Enthalpy and entropy of solvation
Here we will derive an expression for entropy of solvation.
Let G(N,P,T) be the Gibbs free energy of a system of N particles at temperature
T and pressure P. We introduce a solute particle in the system and the new Gibbs
free energy is G(N+1,P,T). This solute particle is allowed to sample the entire volume
of the system. We will denote enthalpy of the system by H and internal energy by U.
We write Gibbs-Helmholtz equation
(∂
(G(N,P,T )
T
)
∂T
)
P
= −H(N,P, T )

(∂

P

Subtract the former from latter,
(∂
(∆G(P,T )
T
)
∂T
)
P
= −∆H(P, T )
T 2
(8.3)
Here ∆G(P, T ) is G(N+1,P,T )−G(N,P,T )
1
. The one in the denominator is the number
of solute particles. So, ∆G(P, T ) is chemical potential (µ = µid + µex) of solute.

8. APPENDIX
µid is the ideal contribution to chemical potential (kBT log Λ
3/V ) . µex is the excess
contribution to the chemical potential. Write H as U+PV.

∆U is Eex, defined as the difference in the internal energy of a solute-solvent system
and just the solvent alone, and the kinetic energy of the solute particle (3kBT

is the derivative of V w.r.t. number of solute particles at constant T and P. This is

And the excess enthalpy of hydration

Eex, is the sum of solute-solvent binding energy (Esw) and reorganization energy
(Ereorg).

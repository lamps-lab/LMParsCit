This dissertation is concerned with the Culler-Shalen techniques for
using the SL (C)-character variety for the fundamental group of a 3-manifold
2
to ﬁnd embedded essential surfaces in the manifold. It is known that when
a boundary slope is strongly detected by the character variety the limiting
eigenvalue of the slope is a root of unity. In Chapter 2, we show that every
root of unity arises in this manner. Given any root of unity, we construct
inﬁnitely many hyperbolic 3-manifolds whose character varieties all detect this
root. In Chapter 3, we give inﬁnitely many hyperbolic knots whose exteriors
have strict boundary slopes which are not strongly detected by the character
variety.

Introduction
This thesis concerns the techniques of Culler and Shalen [8] for ﬁnding
embedded essential surfaces in 3–manifolds. Embedded essential surfaces have
played a critical role in the development of the theory of 3-manifolds, and the
Culler-Shalen machinery provides the most general strategy for constructing
essential surfaces. Their techniques play an important part in proofs of the
Smith conjecture [22], the cyclic surgery theorem [7], and the ﬁnite ﬁlling
conjecture [2], among others.
Let M be a compact irreducible orientable 3-manifold whose boundary
consists of a disjoint union of incompressible tori. We write X(M) to denote
the space of all characters of representations in Hom π (M),SL (C) . This
1 2
spacehasthestructureofanaﬃnealgebraicset. Ifwea¡ssumethatX ⊂¢X(M)
is an irreducible aﬃne curve and let X be the smooth projective model for
X, then all but ﬁnitely many points of X correspond to characters in X.
e
These points are referred to as ordinary points while the points which are not
e
ordinary points are called ideal points. The set of ideal points in X is ﬁnite
and non-empty because we have assumed thatX is a curve. The Culler-Shalen
e
machinery shows how to associate essential surfaces in M to each ideal point
1
in X.
e Although their techniques may associate many diﬀerent essential sur-
faces to a given ideal point, some information about these surfaces can be
obtained by evaluating certain functions in the function ﬁeld C(X) at that
ideal point. Let γ ∈ π (M) and deﬁne the regular function I ∈ C(X) to be
1 γ
the function which evaluates characters on the element γ. That is
I (χ) = χ(γ)
γ
where χ ∈ X. I extends to a meromorphic function
γ
I : X −→ C∪{∞}.
γ
e
Suppose there is a peripheral element β ∈ π (∂M) and an ideal point xˆ ∈ X
1
such that I (xˆ) = ∞. Then there is a unique unoriented isotopy class of a
β e
simple closed curve c ⊂ M with the property that I (xˆ) is ﬁnite. In fact,
[c]
I (xˆ) is of the form ξ +ξ−1 where ξ is a root of unity [4].
[c]
The above information translates directly into topological data about
associated surfaces. Let Σ be an essential surface associated to an ideal point
xˆ as above, and take Σ to have the minimal number of boundary components
among such surfaces. Then, for every connected component Σ of Σ, ∂Σ 6= ∅,
0 0
the order of ξ divides the number of boundary components of Σ , and every
0
boundary component of Σ represents the unoriented isotopy class of c. In this
0
situation, we say that the unoriented isotopy class of c is a strongly detected
boundary slope.
2
In practice, strongly detected slopes are quite common. If the interior
of M is a hyperbolic 3-manifold with ﬁnite volume, then work of Thurston
[25] implies that M has at least two strongly detected boundary slopes. Also,
it follows from work of Kronheimer and Mrowka that the exterior of any non-
trivial knot in S3 has at least one strongly detected boundary slope [3], [10].
Thus, we see that the Culler-Shalen techniques lend themselves particularly
well to these settings.
It is known that a boundary slope which is only represented by bound-
ary components of essential surfaces which are virtual ﬁbers in virtual ﬁbra-
tions over S1 will not be strongly detected [7]. However, in light of the discus-
sion in the previous paragraph, it has been asked whether their techniques are
sensitive enough to ﬁnd all other boundary slopes for the exterior of a given
non-trivial knot in S3. A similar question has been asked for manifolds whose
interiors have a ﬁnite volume structure and a single cusp. In Chapter 3, we
give a negative answer to both questions by exhibiting an inﬁnite family of
hyperbolic knots with boundary slopes which are not strongly detected. (This
work is joint with Stephan Tillmann.)
In[4], itisaskedwhichrootsofunitycanarisewhenaboundaryslopeis
strongly detected. Ohtsuki [19] shows that for the exterior of a 2-bridge knot
every ideal point detects an essential surface with a connected component
which has one or two boundary components. Thus, the only roots of unity
which appear in these cases are ±1. There are, however, examples of higher
order roots. There are explicit examples of 3-manifolds with 4th, 6th, and 11th
3
roots given in [5], [9], and [14]. In Chapter 2, we show that given any n ∈ Z+
there are inﬁnitely many hyperbolic 3-manifolds which have a curve in their
character varieties with ideal points at which nth roots of unity arise in the
strong detection of a boundary slope.
1.1 Preliminary Material
WebeginbyoutliningtheCuller-Shalenconstructionsandstatingsome
known results that will be needed. See [23] as a reference.
1.1.1 Conventions and notation
An embedding
f: F −→ M
of a compact orientable connected surface (F À S2,D2) into an irreducible
3-manifold M is called incompressible if the induced homomorphism
f : π (F) −→ π (M)
∗ 1 1
is injective. If, in addition, f is not properly homotopic into ∂M, then f is
essential in M. We will say that the surface F is essential in M. A discon-
nected compact orientable surface is incompressible (essential) if each of its
components is.
An essential surface F in M is a virtual ﬁber if there is a ﬁnite cover
p: M0 −→ M
4
where M0 is ﬁbered over S1 and the surface F lifts to a ﬁber in M0.
Throughout this dissertation, all 3-manifolds are assumed to be com-
pact, connected, orientable, and irreducible. We assume further that all
boundary components of 3-manifolds are incompressible and homeomorphic
to tori. All surfaces are assumed to be properly embedded and orientable, but
not necessarily connected.
For a topological space Y, we write |Y| to denote the number of con-
nected components of Y.
For a 3-manifold M, we will say that M is hyperbolic if the interior of
M admits a complete ﬁnite volume hyperbolic structure. This is equivalent to
the existence of a discrete faithful homomorphism
π (M) −→ PSL (C).

Aslopeona3-manifoldM istheisotopyclassofanunorientedessential
simple closed curve on a component ∂ M of ∂M. Every slope corresponds to
0
a pair {α,α−1} of primitive elements of π (∂ M). For convenience, we will
1 0
often refer to the slope {α,α−1} as, simply, α. Given a generating set {λ,µ}
for π (∂ M), we can identify the set of slopes on ∂ M with p/q ∈ Q∪{1/0},
1 0 0
where p/q corresponds to the slope λqµp. A boundary slope is a slope that is
representedbyaboundarycomponentofanessentialsurfaceinM.Aboundary
slope is strict if it arises as the boundary of an essential surface which is not
a virtual ﬁber.

Let
G×T −→ T
be a simplicial action of a group G on a simplicial tree T. The action is non-
trivial if no point of T is ﬁxed by the entire group. G acts without inversions
if no element of G interchanges a pair of adjacent vertices of T.
If Y is a simplicial complex, we write Y(i) to denote its i-skeleton.
If L is a 1-manifold properly embedded in a 3-manifold M, then we
write U(L) to denote a small open tubular neighborhood of L in M. If L is a
disjoint union of smooth simple closed curves in S3, we deﬁne the exterior of
the link L as the compact 3-manifold
E(L) = S3 −U(L).
If G is a group, then GAB denotes the abelianization of G.
1.1.2 Representation varieties
An SL (C)-representation for a group G is a homomorphism
2
ρ: G −→ SL (C).
2
We say that an SL (C)-representation ρ is irreducible if the only two invariant
2
vector subspaces of C2 under the action of ρ(G) are {0} and C2. Otherwise, ρ
is reducible.
We denote the space of all SL (C)-representations for G by R(G) and
2
by R(M) if G = π (M) for a 3-manifold M. Two representations ρ,ρ0 ∈ R(G)
1
6
are equivalent if ρ0 = Jρ where J is an inner automorphism of SL (C). The
2
character of a representation ρ ∈ R(G) is the function
χ : G −→ C
ρ
given by χ (γ) = Tr(ρ(γ)). Since the trace function on SL (C) is invariant
ρ 2
under inner automorphisms, equivalent SL (C)-representations always have
2
the same character. A reducible representation always shares its character
with an abelian representation and irreducible representations are determined
up to conjugacy by their characters.
Assume that G is ﬁnitely generated and let hγ ,...,γ |r ,...i be a
1 n 1
presentation for G. We can identify R(G) with the set
n
ρ(γ ),...,ρ(γ ) ρ ∈ R(G) ⊂ SL (C) ⊂ R4n.

R(G) is an aﬃne algebraic set¯in R4n since it is deﬁned by polynomial equa-
tions which arise from the set of relations {r } and from the condition that
i
det ρ(γ ) = 1. (If {r } = ∞, there are inﬁnitely many deﬁning equations,
i i
how¡ever, ¢by the Hil¯bert¯basis theorem, we can always replace them with a
¯ ¯
ﬁnite set of polynomial equations.) Given any two such presentations for
G, there is a polynomial bijection between their corresponding aﬃne algebraic
sets. Therefore, up to canonical isomorphism, R(G) is well-deﬁned as an aﬃne
algebraic set.
Let R be an irreducible algebraic component of R(G) and let K be
0
the function ﬁeld C(R ). We construct the tautological representation for R

as follows. For i ∈ {1,...,n}, let a ,b ,c and d be the four coordinate

1.1.3 Character varieties
Let X(G) denote the space of characters of SL (C)-characters for G.
2
For every element γ ∈ G, we deﬁne the function
I : R(G) −→ C
γ
by I (ρ) = χ (γ). This map descends to a map (also denoted by I ) from
γ ρ γ
X(G) to C.
Let
t: R(G) −→ X(G)
be the map that takes a representation to its character. It is shown in [8] that
the map t can be viewed as a map into Cr given by
t(ρ) = I (ρ),...,I (ρ) ∈ Cr
δ1 δr
¡ ¢
8
for a ﬁnite set {δ ,...,δ } ⊂ G. The following result is Proposition 1.4.4 in
1 r
[8].
Proposition 1.1.1. If R is an irreducible component of R(G) which contains
0
an irreducible representation, then t(R ) has the structure of an aﬃne algebraic
0
set.
If G = π (M) where M is hyperbolic, then we know more. Since M is
1
hyperbolic, we have a discrete faithful representation
ρ : π (M) −→ PSL (C).
0 1 2
It is well known that there exist lifts of ρ to SL (C). The following theorem
0 2
is due to Thurston and can be found as Theorem 4.5.1 of [23].
Theorem 1.1.2. Let ρ˜ : π (M) −→ SL (C) be a lift of ρ . Let X be an
0 1 2 0 0
irreducible component of X(M) containing t(ρ˜). Then
0
dimC(X0) = |∂M|.
Furthermore, if B ,...,B are the boundary components of M and g ∈ π (M)
1 m i 1
lies in a conjugacy class carried by B , then t(ρ˜) is an isolated point of the
i 0
algebraic subset
{χ ∈ X |I2 = ··· = I2 = 4}.

If X is an irreducible algebraic curve in X(G) ⊂ Cr, then we write
0
X to denote its smooth projective completion. (X can be deﬁned as the

f f
9
smooth projective curve which is birationally equivalent to X , it is unique
0
up to birational equivalence.) The birational equivalence φ: X −→ X is
0 0
well-deﬁned at all but a ﬁnite set of points; we call these points ideal points
f
whereas the remaining points of X are called ordinary points. We identify the

If R is an irreducible falgebraic set in R(G) with t R(G) = X , then

the regular map t induces an injection ¡ ¢

Using this identiﬁcation of C(X ) with a subﬁeld of C(R ), we can view C(R )
0 0 0
as an extension of C(X ). Since R and X are ﬁnite dimensional, C(R ) and
0 0 0 0
C(X ) are ﬁnitely generated over C, and therefore C(R ) is ﬁnitely generated
0 0
over C(X ).

1.2 The action associated to an ideal point
Take R , X , and X as at the end of the previous section. Let F =
0 0 0
C(X ) and K = C(R ).

Because X is smooth, for any point x ∈ X we get a valuation


We saythat a valuation is non-trivial if there exists an element which
values negatively. Recall that if xˆ is an ideal point, we have a γ ∈ G with
I (x) = ∞. Thus, v (I ) < 0, and so the valuation v is non-trivial.
γ xˆ γ xˆ
We can use the following extension theorem from [15] to “extend” the
valuation v to a non-trivial valuation on K×.
xˆ
Theorem 1.2.1. Let K be a ﬁnitely generated extension of a ﬁeld F. Let
ω: F× −→ Z be a valuation. Then there exists a valuation v: K× −→ Z such
that v|F× = d·ω for some d ∈ Z+.
Recalling the tautological representation for R , we have
0
P: G −→ SL (K)
2
where K is now equipped with a non-trivial discrete valuation given by xˆ.
Work in [21] shows how use a non-trivial valuation to construct a simplicial
tree T on which SL (K) acts simplicially, non-trivially, and without inversions.
2
Using P, we pull back this action to get an action of G on T. We say that
such an action is associated to the ideal point xˆ. The following proposition is
fundamental (see Proposition 1.2.6 of [7]).
Proposition 1.2.2. Let G × T −→ T be an action associated to an ideal
point xˆ. An element γ ∈ G has a ﬁxed point in T if and only if I (xˆ) 6= ∞.
γ
11
Moreover, if N is a normal subgroup of P(G) which ﬁxes a point of T, then N
is contained in the center of SL (K) or P(G) contains an abelian subgroup of
2
index at most 2.
Henceforth, as no new information comes from them, we will ignore
components of X(G) which correspond to tautological representations where
P(G) contains an abelian subgroup of ﬁnite index. Notice also, that the ﬁrst
part of Proposition 1.2.2 implies that G acts non-trivially on T.
1.3 Ideal points and essential surfaces
For the remainder of this chapter, we assume that G = π (M) for a
1
3-manifold M with |∂M| = 1. Let
p: M −→ M
f
betheuniversalcoverforM.FixatriangulationforM andgiveM theinduced
triangulation.
f
Assume that
π (M)×T −→ T
1
is an action associated to an ideal point xˆ. Let E be the set of midpoints of
edges of T. We explain how to use this setup to construct essential surfaces in
M.
We say that a properly embedded surface Σ ⊂ M is associated to the
12
action if there exists a π (M)-equivariant map
1
f: M −→ T
f
which is transverse to E and such that f−1(E) = p−1(Σ). Notice that any such
surface is orientable because π (M) acts without inversions.
1
There are many such maps; one such is constructed as follows. Let
S(0) be a complete set of orbit representatives for the action of π (M) on M(0).
1
Deﬁne f on S(0) by any map into T(0) and extend f to all of M(0) using π (M)-
1f
invariance. This map extends to a π (M)-invariant map on all of M since T
1 f
is contractible. This map can be taken to be simplicial, and hence transverse
f
to E. The surface p f−1(E) is associated to the action.
¡ ¢
We can now state the following (see Proposition 1.3.2 of [7]).
Proposition 1.3.1. Assume that Σ is a surface associated to the action given
by an ideal point. Then, for each component D of M −Σ, the image of π (D)
1
in π (M) is contained in a vertex stabilizer. Thus, the fact that the action is
1
non-trivial implies that any associated surface is non-empty.
Standard arguments show how f can be adjusted to make p f−1(E)
essential in M (see [23] for a detailed account). This proves the ¡following¢
theorem.
Theorem 1.3.2. If X(M) has a component with dimension at least one, then
M contains an essential surface.
13
Proof. Let R be an irreducible algebraic subset of R(M) whose projection
0
to X(M) is a curve X . Since X is a curve, the set of ideal points in X is
0 0 0
non-empty. Let xˆ be one such ideal point. Then, as discussed above, we can
f
construct a tree T on which π (M) acts without inversions. Take f: M −→ T
1
to be any π (M)-invariant map which is transverse to E. Let Σ = p f−1(E) .
1 f
From the comments above, we may assume that Σ is an essential ¡surface i¢n
M and, by Proposition 1.3.1, Σ 6= ∅.
We obtain more information about surfaces associated to ideal points
using Proposition 1.3.8 from [7].
Proposition 1.3.3. Assume that π (M) × T −→ T is an action on a tree
1
given by an ideal point. If C is a connected subcomplex of ∂M such that the
image of π (C) in π (M) is contained in a vertex stabilizer, then there is an
1 1
essential surface associated to the action which is disjoint from C.
This is especially useful in the following setting. Assume that xˆ is an
ideal point in X where X is an algebraic curve in X(M). Assume also that
0 0
c is an oriented essential simple closed curve on ∂M with
f
I (xˆ) ∈ C.
[c]
Then [c] stabilizes a vertex under the action π (M) × T −→ T given by xˆ.
1
By Proposition 1.3.3, there exists an essential surface associated to xˆ which
is disjoint from the curve c. If we assume further that there exists another
14
oriented essential simple closed curve s on ∂M where
I (xˆ) = ∞
[s]
then, by Proposition 1.2.2, [s] ∈ π (M) does not ﬁx any vertex of T. Using
1
Proposition 1.3.1, we see that any surface associated to the action on T given
by xˆ must intersect the curve s. Choose an essential surface Σ associated to xˆ
which is disjoint from c. Since ∂Σ is a non-empty collection of essential simple
closed curves parallel to c, [c] is a boundary slope. In fact, by considering
Propositions 1.2.2 and 1.3.1, we conclude that this boundary slope is strict.
When a strict boundary slope arises in this manner we say that it is strongly
detected by the ideal point xˆ.
If M is hyperbolic, then, by Theorem 1.1.2, we know that there is
a curve X in X(M). Theorem 1.1.2 also implies that if α is a non-trivial
0
primitive element of π (∂M), then I is non-constant on X . This implies that
1 α 0
there is an ideal point xˆ ∈ X with I (xˆ) = ∞. As above, any essential surface
0 α
Σ associated to xˆ must intersect any simple closed curve on ∂M which is
f
parallel to a representative of α. Thus, components of ∂Σ represent boundary
slopes for M. Now choose β ∈ π (∂M) so that a representative for β is parallel
1
to the components of ∂Σ and repeat the above argument. We obtain a new
ideal point yˆ with I (yˆ) = ∞. Let Λ be an essential surface associated to
β
yˆ. Then boundary components of Λ represent a new boundary slope for M.
Therefore, M has at least two strongly detected boundary slopes.
15
Figure 1.1: The ﬁgure-eight knot
Example (The ﬁgure-eight knot). Let K bethe ﬁgure-eightknot as shown
in Figure 1.1. Then M = E(K) is an example of a hyperbolic manifold with
one boundary component and exactly two strongly detected boundary slopes.
It is worth noting that E(K) actually has three boundary slopes; in addition
tothetwostronglydetectedslopes, theboundaryofanessentialSeifertsurface
gives another boundary slope for E(K). However, this slope is not strict which
explains why it is not strongly detected.
In light of the discussion preceding the example, it is convenient to
divide the ideal points of X(M) into two classes.
• An ideal point xˆ is of type I if for every α ∈ π (∂M) we have I (xˆ) ∈ C.
1 α
• An ideal point xˆ is of type II if there exists an α ∈ π (∂M) with I (xˆ) =
1 α
∞.
If xˆ is of type I, then Proposition 1.3.3 implies that there is a closed
essential surfaces associated to xˆ. 3-manifolds which do not contain closed
16
essential surfaces are called small. In this terminology, we see that small 3-
manifolds do not have any type I ideal points.
On the other hand, if xˆ is of type II, then xˆ strongly detects a unique
strict boundary slope. Assume that Σ is an essential surface associated to xˆ.
Then ∂Σ 6= ∅ and the boundary components of Σ are essential closed curves all
representing the same boundary slope. Assume that β ∈ π (∂M) represents
1
this slope. By Proposition 1.3.1, β stabilizes a vertex of T. Proposition 1.2.2
implies that I (xˆ) ∈ C. If Λ is another essential surface associated to xˆ, then
β
let α ∈ π (∂M) represent the boundary slope realized by Λ. Again, we have
1
that I (xˆ) ∈ C. If α ∈/ {β±1}, take C to be the 1-complex in ∂M made up of
α
two simple closed curves representing α and β. Proposition 1.3.3 implies that
we can ﬁnd a closed essential surface associated to xˆ. This contradicts our
assumption that xˆ is of type II, so we must have α ∈ {β±1}. We summarize
with the following handy proposition.
Proposition 1.3.4. If xˆ is a type II ideal point, then there is a unique (up to
inverses) primitive element β ∈ π (∂M) with the property that I (xˆ) ∈ C. β
1 β
is the unique strongly detected boundary slope detected by xˆ.
A surface Σ associated to an ideal point is said to be reduced if it is
essential and has the minimal number of boundary components among all
essential surfaces associated to this ideal point. The following theorem gives
us some additional topological information about reduced surfaces associated
to type II ideal points [4].
17
Theorem 1.3.5. Assume that β ∈ π (∂M) represents a boundary slope which
1
is strongly detected by an ideal point xˆ. Then I (xˆ) = ξ+ξ−1 where ξ is a root
β
of unity. Moreover, if Σ is a reduced surface associated to β, then the order of
ξ divides |∂Σ|.
We say that ξ appears as a root of unity for M.
Sometimes boundary slopes are realized by surfaces associated to type I
idealpoints. Inotherwords,althoughsurfacesassociatedtoanidealpointmay
be taken to be disjoint from ∂M, there may be essential surfaces associated to
the same ideal point which have non-empty boundary. We say that this ideal
point weakly detects the boundary slope represented by the boundary of such
a surface.
There are known examples of 3-manifolds with strict boundary slopes
which are not strongly detected but are weakly detected. The ﬁrst examples
were given in [20]. In their paper, Schanuel and Zhang give a family of (non-
hyperbolic)graphmanifoldswithstrictboundaryslopeswhicharenotstrongly
detected. The slopes in question are, however, weakly detected [27].
As mentioned above, if an ideal point xˆ strongly detects a boundary
slope, then it detects a unique slope. The same is not known to be true if the
boundary slope is weakly detected.
Question 1.3.1. If xˆ is an ideal point which weakly detects a boundary slope
β, is β the unique boundary slope detected by this ideal point?
18
1.4 A-polynomials
The A-polynomial A (l,m) for M was introduced in [4]. It is helpful
M
in identifying strongly detected boundary slopes for M.
Throughout this section, we ﬁx a generating set {λ,µ} for π (∂M).
1
If ρ is an SL (C)-representation of the peripheral subgroup π (∂M) with
2 1
Tr ρ(µ) 6= ±2, then ρ is conjugate to a diagonal representation. We are
con¡cerne¢d with characters of SL (C)-representations and traces are invariant
2
under conjugation, hence we will assume that ρ is diagonal. Take l,m ∈ C×
so that
l 0 m 0
ρ(λ) = and ρ(µ) = .
0 l−1 0 m−1
µ ¶ µ ¶
On the other hand, since π (∂M) ∼= Z × Z, every pair (l,m) of non-zero
1
complex numbers determines such a representation. Two such representations
ρ and ρ0 will have the same character if and only if the upper left entries of the
pair ρ(λ), ρ(µ) are related to the upper left entries of the pair ρ0(λ), ρ0(µ) by
the involution (l,m) 7→ l−1,m−1 . Thus, we see that X(∂M) is the quotient
of C× ×C× by this invo¡lution. ¢
The inclusion
i: ∂M −→ M
induces a regular map
i∗: X(M) −→ X(∂M)
by restricting characters to the boundary subgroup of π (M). Let {X }k be
1 j j=1
the set of irreducible components of X(M) such that, for every j ∈ {1,...,k},
19
Xj contains the character of an irreducible representation and dimC i∗(Xj) =

normalized to have relatively prime Z-coeﬃcients. This is the A-polynomial
for M corresponding to the generating set {λ,µ}.

© ª
From [4], we have the famous “boundary slopes are boundary slopes” theorem.
Theorem 1.4.1. There exists an edge of N with slope p/q if and only if p/q
M
is a strongly detected boundary slope for M.
We give a rough description of why this is true. Assume that e is
an edge of N with slope p/q. Let σ = λaµb and τ = λqµp where a and b
M
are chosen so that ap − bq = 1. Then {σ,τ} gives a new generating set for
π (∂M). We have λ = σpτ−b and µ = σ−qτa. To compute the A-polynomial
1
which corresponds to this new generating set, we set l = spt−b and m = s−qta
in A (l,m) and normalize as before. The result is of the form
M
A (s,t) = f(t)+r(s,t)
M
20
where f has at least one non-zero root ξ and r(0,t) = 0 for every t ∈ C. The
edge polynomial for e is deﬁned as
f (x) = x−n ·f(x)
e
where x ∈ Z+ is chosen so that f ∈ Z[x] and f (0) 6= 0.
e e
Noticethatthesolution(0,ξ)toA (s,t) = 0doesnotcorrespondtoan
M
imageofacharacterinX(M).However, inthesetofsolutionstothisequation,
the points that do correspond to characters of irreducible representations are
dense. Hence, there is a sequence {χ } of such characters with
i
lim χ (τ) = ξ +ξ−1 and lim χ (σ) = ∞.
i i
i→∞ i→∞
Therefore, there is a type II ideal point corresponding to the limit of these
characters. τ = λqµp is a strongly detected boundary slope and ξ is the
associated root of unity.
21
Chapter 2
Roots of unity and the character variety
In this chapter, we prove the following theorem.
Theorem 2.0.2. Let n be a positive integer. There exist inﬁnitely many hy-
perbolic 3-manifolds {M } with |∂M | = 1 such that if ξ is any nth root of
i i
unity, then ξ appears as a root root of unity for every M .
i
The idea of the proof is this. For each n, we construct a 3-manifold M
n
for which every nth root of unity appears. The manifolds M contain essential
n
tori. It is well known that hyperbolic 3-manifolds do not contain essential tori,
hence these manifolds are never hyperbolic. However, we can use standard
techniques to construct hyperbolic 3-manifolds that admit degree-one maps
onto M . The root of unity property is inherited by the hyperbolic manifolds
n
through the induced epimorphism on fundamental groups.
2.1 Construction of the manifolds M
n
This section relies on the existence of 3-manifolds M with |∂M| = 1
and a strongly detected boundary slope with root of unity +1. First, we show
that the exterior of the ﬁgure-eight knot satisﬁes these conditions. We follow
this discussion with the general construction for M .
n
22
Let K ⊂ S3 be the ﬁgure-eight knot and M = E(K). We have a
standard 2-bridge presentation for π (M) given by
1
π (M) = hµ,y|µW = Wyi
1
where W = y−1µyµ−1, and µ is a meridian for M. A longitude for µ can be
computed to be λ = WW∗ where W∗ = µ−1yµy−1. We prove the following
well-known proposition.
Proposition 2.1.1. λµ4 is a strongly detected boundary slope for M. The
associated root of unity is +1.
Proof. The A-polynomial for M with respect to the basis {λ,µ} can be com-
puted from the above presentation of π (M). As in [4], it is given by
1
A (l,m) = −l+lm2 +m4 +2lm4 +l2m4 +lm6 −lm8. (2.1)
M
The Newton polygon for this polynomial is pictured in Figure 2.1. Since the
polygon has an edge with slope 4, we apply Theorem 1.4.1 to see that λµ4 is
a strongly detected boundary slope. Let σ = λµ3 and τ = λµ4.
We compute the A-polynomial for M with respect to the basis {σ,τ},
as in the discussion following Theorem 1.4.1. We obtain
A (s,t) = (t7 −t8)+s2(−s6 +s4t2 +2s2t4 +s6t+t6).
M
Therefore, the edge polynomial which corresponds to the boundary slope τ is
f(x) = 1−x.

Let M be any 3-manifold with |∂M| = 1 and xˆ an ideal point of X(M)
which strongly detects a boundary slope τ ∈ π (∂M) with root of unity +1.

Choose σ ∈ π (∂M) so that {σ,τ} form a generating set for π (∂M). Then
1 1
there is a sequence of irreducible characters {χ } lying on a curve in X(M)

χ (τ) → 2 and χ (σ) → ∞.

The manifold M will be the union of the manifold M and a two com-
n
ponent link exterior as follows. Fix a positive integer n, and let L be the

exterior of a two component link J ∪ K ⊂ S3 where the linking number of
J and K is ±n. (For example, take J ∪ K to be the (2,2n)-torus link. The
(2,6)-torus link is pictured in Figure 2.2.) For A ∈ {J,K}, let {λ ,µ } be a

longitude/meridian pair for the exterior E(A). We have the Hurewicz epimor-
phism
h: π (L ) −→ H (L ) ∼= Z×Z.

set of distinct points on a single curve component C of D . ©Recallªthat the

Let C ⊂ D ⊂ C× ×C× be the inverse image of C under this quotient map.

Let P(y,z) be the irreducible polynomial that deﬁnes the curve C.
By construction, P(0,ξ) = 0. However, P(0,z) is not identically zero
because the points (0,z) ∈ C always correspond to ideal points in X(M )
n
and C has only ﬁnitely many such points. Therefore, P(0,z) is a non-trivial
single variable polynomial. Thus, we see that the Newton polygon N has a
P
vertical edge with edge polynomial x−m · P(0,x) for some integer m. ξ is a
root of this edge polynomial. Also, by deﬁnition of the A-polynomial, P(y,z)
divides A (y,z). So P(0,z) divides A (0,z). This implies that the Newton
Mn Mn
polygon for A also has a vertical edge e and f (ξ) = 0. Since this is true for

any nth root of unity, we conclude that 1−xn divides f .

2.3 Hyperbolic Examples
Here, we extend the result to hyperbolic examples and complete the
proof of Theorem 2.0.2.
Beforeweprovethetheorem, wegiveadeﬁnitionandstatetwolemmas.
A null-homotopic knot in a 3-manifold M is an embedded circle k ⊂ M, such
that k is homotopic to a point. Now, as a special case of the main theorem in
[17], we have
28
Lemma 2.3.1. For each n ∈ Z+, M contains inﬁnitely many null-homotopic
n
hyperbolic knots.
Oursecondlemmaisalsostandardbutwegiveaproofforcompleteness
(cf. Proposition 3.2 in [1]).
Lemma 2.3.2. Let k be a null homotopic knot in M and M be a 3-manifold
n
obtained by a Dehn surgery on k. Then there is a degree-one map f: M −→
M .
n
Proof. Let M0 = M −U(k). From our assumptions, we have a slope s on ∂M0
n
so that M is obtained from M0 by identifying the boundary of a solid torus V
to ∂M0 so that a simple closed curve representing the slope s bounds a disk
D ⊂ V.
Deﬁne f: M0 −→ M0 ⊂ M to be the identity. If we can extend the
n
map f over V then it will be a degree one map as needed. First, f extends
over a regular neighborhood U(D) of the disk D since f(∂D) is homotopic to
k which is homotopic to a point. Next, f extends over the ball V − U(D)
because every immersed 2-sphere in M is homotopic to a point.
n
Armed with these lemmas, we are ready to prove Theorem 2.0.2.
Proof. Let k be a null-homotopic knot in M as provided by Lemma 2.3.1.
n
By Thurston’s hyperbolic Dehn surgery theorem [24], for all but ﬁnitely many
slopes s, the manifold obtained by doing Dehn surgery on k with surgery slope
29
s is hyperbolic. This gives us an inﬁnite set of distinct hyperbolic manifolds
{M }∞ .
i i=1
Furthermore, for every i ∈ Z+, Lemma 2.3.2 gives us a degree-one map
f : M −→ M .
i i n
Since f is degree-one, the induced map f∗: π (M ) −→ π (M ) is an epimor-
i i 1 i 1 n
phism and the restriction to the peripheral subgroup of π (M ) is an isomor-
1 i
phism onto the peripheral subgroup of π (M ).
1 n
Let α be a primitive element of π (∂M ) so that f∗(α) = µ . Similarly,
1 i i J
take β to be a primitive element of π (∂M ) so that f∗(β) = λ . Pick ξ to be
1 i i J
any nth root of unity. Then Theorem 2.2.1 gives us a sequence of irreducible

representations that are irreducible on M and abelian on L . Take σ and τ as

ρ(µ5) = ρ(τ) and ρ(µ ) = ρ(σ).

Starting with A (l,m), we take a resultant with respect to ms − a5

31
conclude that the polynomial equation

holds true for all such representations. Therefore, the right hand side is a
factor of the A-polynomial for M with respect to the generating set {λ ,µ }.

Evaluating at b = 0, we get
0 = −a175 +5a180 −10a185 +10a190 −5a195 +a200
= a175(a5 −1)5.
We conclude that there is a vertical edge e in the Newton polygon for the
A-polynomial of M . Furthermore, if f (x) is the associated edge polynomial,
5 e
(x5 −1)5 divides f (x).

2.5 Final Remarks
It should be noted that, although the manifolds constructed in Section
2.3 are hyperbolic, the ideal points at which nth roots of unity appear are not
on components of the character varieties that correspond to the complete hy-
perbolic structure of the manifold. This is because the components considered
here arise from epimorphisms with non-trivial kernels and so the characters
32
on these components are never characters of discrete faithful representations.
The question of whether all roots of unity appear at ideal points on hyperbolic
components remains unanswered.

Chapter 3
Not all boundary slopes are strongly detected
Inthischapter, wegiveaninﬁnitefamilyofhyperbolicknotswithstrict
boundary slopes that are not strongly detected.
As mentioned in Section 1.3, Schanuel and Zhang give examples of
graph manifolds with strict boundary slopes that are not strongly detected.
Their examples left open the following interesting questions.
Question 3.0.1 (Cooper-Long 1996). Is every strict boundary slope for
the complement of a knot in S3 strongly detected?
Question 3.0.2 (Schanuel-Zhang 2001). Let M be an orientable hyper-
bolic 3-manifold with |∂M| = 1. Is every strict boundary slope of M strongly
detected?
Question 3.0.3. In the setting of either of the previous two questions, is
every strict boundary slope either strongly or weakly detected? (Recall the
deﬁnition of weak detection following Theorem 1.3.5.)
We answer the ﬁrst two questions with Theorem 3.0.3, the main theo-
rem of this chapter. We ﬁrst note that Question 3.0.1 can be answered with
34
non-hyperbolic examples by using the more elementary Theorem 3.0.1. Corol-
lary3.0.2willshowthataconnectsumoftwosmallknots(Figure3.1)provides
an answer to this question.

Let K be the connect sum of two knots K and K and write M =

E(K), M = E(K ), and M = E(K ). Let µ be a meridian for K. We can

view π (M) as the free product with amalgamation
1
π (M) = π (M ) ∗ π (M ).

This decomposition allows us to view µ also as a meridian for both K and
L

R L R 1 1 L 1 R
Observe that λ = λ λ . By construction, M contains an essential annulus

with boundary slope µ. We can prove the following theorem.
Theorem 3.0.1. If the strict boundary slope µ is strongly detected for M then
µ is also a strongly detected boundary slope for either M or M .
L R
35
Our proof uses the following elementary facts about SL (C).
2
(1) If A, B, and C are elements of SL (C) such that A and B commute and
2
also B and C commute, then A and C commute.
(2) Let {A } and {B } be subsets of SL (C) with the property that A com-
i i 2 i
mutes with B for each i. If both Tr(A ) and Tr(B ) are bounded then
i i i
Tr(A B ) is also bounded.
i i
Proof. Assume that µ is strongly detected for M. Then Proposition 1.3.4 pro-
vides a curve X ⊂ X(M) and an ideal point xˆ ∈ X such that
e
I (xˆ) = z ∈ C and I (xˆ) = ∞.

This implies that there is a sequence of representations {ρ }∞ ⊂ R(M) whose
i i+1
characters lie on X and such that
lim Tr ρ (µ) = z and lim Tr ρ (λ) = ∞.
i i
x→∞ x→∞
¡ ¢ ¡ ¢
Since µ commutes with both λ and λ we can apply fact (1) to conclude
L R
that the sequences {ρ (λ )} and {ρ (λ )} satify the hypotheses of fact (2).

Because the traces Tr ρ (λ) are unbounded, fact (2) allows us, without loss
i
of generality, to assum¡e that¢
lim Tr ρ (λ ) = ∞.
i L

¡ ¢
We conclude that µ is a strongly detected boundary slope for M .

36
Corollary 3.0.2. Let K be the connect sum of two small knots K and K .
L R
Then E(K) has the strict boundary slope 1/0 which is not strongly detected.
Proof. Since K and K are small, [7] shows that neither M nor M have
L R L R
the boundary slope 1/0.
If K is as in Corollary 3.0.2 then it is true that the character variety
for K has ideal points that detect the essential annulus in E(K). These ideal
must, by deﬁnition, be of type I. Hence, the strict boundary slope 1/0 of E(K)
is weakly and not strongly detected.
For the remainder of this chapter, we devote our attention to exhibit-
ing knots which answer Question 3.0.2. Let M = E(K ) where K is the
n n n
(3,5,2n+1,2)-pretzel knot pictured in Figure 3.2.
Theorem 3.0.3. Let n > 1 be an integer. Then M is hyperbolic and has the
n
strict boundary slope 4(n+4) which is not strongly detected.
We do not know if these boundary slopes are weakly detected or not.
In either case, there are interesting ramiﬁcations. If the slope is not weakly
detected, then these would be the ﬁrst known examples of strict boundary
slopes that are not detected by any ideal point, thus, giving an answer to
Question 3.0.3. If it is weakly detected, then using [18], one can show that
there is an ideal point which weakly detects two distinct boundary slopes:
4(n+4) and 1/0. This second scenario would provide an answer to Question
1.3.1.

that is not strongly (and hence not weakly) detected?
3.1 Proof of Theorem 3.0.3
This section gives an outline for the proof of Theorem 3.0.3. Missing
details are given in Sections 3.2 and 3.3.
One obvious approach to proving that a slope is not strongly detected
is to calculate the A-polynomial and use the Newton polygon to ﬁnd the
strongly detected boundary slopes. This is computationally diﬃcult and is
unlikely to give a general argument for an inﬁnite collection of manifolds. We
take a diﬀerent approach – the key idea is to use a relationship between the
38
character varieties of mutants.
We deﬁne a Conway sphere in a knot exterior M to be a separating
essential surface in M which is homeomorphic to a 2-sphere with four open
disks removed and whose boundary components represent meridians for the
knot.
If S is a Conway sphere in M and
4
τ: S −→ S
4 4
is an orientation preserving involution, the mutant Mτ is deﬁned as the man-
ifold formed by cutting M along S and re-glueing with the homeomorphism
4
τ.
It follows from work of Oertel [18] that the manifolds M are not only
n
hyperbolic, but they also contain Conway spheres. In particular, there is a
Conway sphere in M which separates the ﬁrst two tangles of K from the
n n
second two. A mutation in this Conway sphere results in a manifold Mτ
n
which is homeomorphic to the exterior of the (5,3,2n+1,2)-pretzel knot. We
will write Kτ to denote this knot.
n
It will sometimes be convenient for us to think about mutation in a
slightly diﬀerent way. Because [∂S ] = 0 ∈ H (M), the components of ∂S
4 1 4
come in two oppositely oriented pairs. Therefore, ∂S bounds two annuli in
4
∂M. Let G be the genus-2 surface formed by attaching these annuli to S and
2 4
pushing the resulting surface slightly into the interior of M. The involution
39
τ: S −→ S extends to an involution τ: G −→ G . If we cut along G and
4 4 2 2 2
re-glue using τ, we get a manifold which is homeomorphic to Mτ.
The following proposition is the starting point for the ideas in this
chapter. We outline the proof below, complete details can be found in [26].
Proposition 3.1.1. Suppose that M and Mτ are knot exteriors related to each
other by a mutation τ on a Conway sphere S . If X ⊂ X(M) is an algebraic
4
curve containing the character of a representation whose restriction to π (S )
1 4
is irreducible, then there exists a curve Xτ ⊂ X(Mτ) and a birational map
f: X −→ Xτ. Furthermore, using standard longitude/meridian coordinates
for slopes, the set of boundary slopes strongly detected for M by X is identical
to the set of boundary slopes strongly detected by Xτ for Mτ.
Proof. Because the peripheral subgroup of M is carried by one component of
M −G , it will be helpful to thing of Mτ as being formed using the involution
2
τ: G −→ G . (Recall the notation preceding the proposition.)
2 2
The surface G splits both M and Mτ into the same two submanifolds
2
M and M . In particular, we have the following commutative diagram of
1 2
inclusion induced homomorphisms.

We label M and M so that M is the submanifold with two boundary com-

Suppose that
ρ: π (M) −→ SL (C)
1 2
is a representation whose restriction toπ (S ) is irreducible. Then since π (S )
1 4 1 4
is contained in the image of π (G ) in π (M), we see that
1 2 1
ρ◦i ◦g : π (G ) −→ SL (C)
1 1 1 2 2
is also irreducible. Hence, this representation for π (G ) is determined, up to
1 2
conjugacy, by its character. A calculation (see [26] for example) shows that
Tr◦ρ◦i ◦g = Tr◦ρ◦i ◦g ◦τ .

Thus, we have an inner automorphism I: SL (C) −→ SL (C) such that

with
ρτ ◦j = ρ◦i and ρτ ◦j = I◦ρ◦i .
1 1 2 2
Let f be the map which takes the character of ρ to the character of ρτ.
The characters in X that correspond to reducible representations on
π (S ) form a codimension-1 subvariety of X. Hence, f is well-deﬁned on all
1 4
but a codimension-1 subvariety of X. It is shown in [26] that f is a rational
map. Finally, to see that f is a birational equivalence, we simply deﬁne an
inverse map g from the irreducible characters in Xτ to X in exactly the same
way as we deﬁned f.
It remains to prove that f preserves the set of strongly detected bound-
ary slopes. Let B be the genus-1 boundary component of M and take
1
{λ,µ} ⊂ π (B) so that {i (λ),i (µ)} is a longitude/meridian pair for M. Let
1 1 1
h·,·i denote oriented intersection number. Since
i (λ),i (µ) = hλ,µi = j (λ),j (µ) ,
1 1 1 1
  ®   ®
we will be done if we can show that the image of λ is trivial in H (Mτ).

To see this, we may choose a presentation
ha,b,c,d|aba−1b−1cdc−1d−1 = 1i
for π (G ) such that
1 2
42
(1) both a and d have trivial images in H (M ) and
1 2
(2) b and c are meridians for M with the same orientation.
Note that the order-2 automorphism τ : π (G ) −→ π (G ) is either given
∗ 1 2 1 2
by τ (α) = α−1 for every α ∈ {a,b,c,d}, by τ (a) = d and τ (b) = c, or by

the composition of the two. In any case, properties (1) and (2) are preserved
under precomposition with τ . This implies that
∗
ker(h◦i ◦g ) = ker(h◦j ◦g ◦τ )
1 1 2 2 ∗
where h denotes the Hurewicz epimorphism from fundamental group to ﬁrst
homology. We have shown that the image of λ in H (Mτ) is trivial, which
1
completes the proof of the proposition.
Thus, from Proposition 3.1.1, we can conclude that if the set of bound-
ary slopes for our manifolds M and Mτ are diﬀerent, then any boundary
n n
slope which is strongly detected and not contained in their intersection must
be detected by a curve of characters whose restriction to the Conway sphere
is reducible.
Section 3.3 shows that, for the manifolds {M }, the only boundary
n
slope which could possibly be strongly detected on such a curve is the slope
1/0. In Section 3.2, we show that 4(n + 4) is a boundary slope for M but
n
not for Mτ. Thus, Proposition 3.1.1 completes the proof that 4(n + 4) is a
n
boundary slope for M which is not strongly detected.

3.2 Mutants with distinct slope sets
In this section, the algorithm of [13] is used to show that the pretzel
knot K has the boundary slope 4(n+4) whereas Kτ does not.

3.2.1 Setup from [13]
The constructions from [13] which apply to our setting are reviewed
in this section. In particular, it is assumed throughout that K denotes a
four-tangle pretzel knot.
The 3-sphere S3 can be decomposed into the union of four 3-balls,
{B }3 , where 3B ∼= S1 (the axis for K), and each B contains exactly one
i i=0 0 i i
of the four givenTtangles. If F is a properly embedded surface in M = E(K),
we may assume that it is transverse to ∂B for every i. Hence, F = F ∩B is
i i i
properly embedded in B for all i and P = ∂B ∩K consists of four points. In
i i i
particular, ∂F is a curve system on the 4-punctured sphere S = ∂B −U(P ).
i i i i
We will denote the ith tangle K ∩B by T .

Curve systems on the 4-punctured sphere are either carried by the
train track shown in Figure 3.3(a) or by its mirror image. Usually we will

Figure 3.3: Curve systems and tangles
A p/q-tangle, denotedbyhpi,is a projective curve system [1,q−1,p], or
q
equivalently ((q−1)/q, p/q) in uv-coordinates. A p/q-circle, denoted by hpi◦,
q
is a projective curve system [0,q,p], or equivalently (1, p/q). The ∞-tangle,
denoted by h∞i, is the projective class of the pair of vertical arcs shown in
Figure 3.3(b), and will be represented by (−1,0) in uv-coordinates.
We now use the above deﬁnitions to deﬁne a graph D in the uv-plane.
The vertices of D are the uv-coordinates of the p/q-tangles and p/q-circles for
every p/q ∈ Q together with the point h∞i = (−1,0). There are four types of
edges in D, non-horizontal edges, horizontal edges, vertical edges and inﬁnity
edges. Two vertices hpi and hri are connected by a non-horizontal edge if
q s
|ps−qr| = 1, or equivalently, if hri can be obtained from hpi by surgery on an
s q
arc. The horizontal edges connect the vertices hpi◦ to hpi. The vertical edges
q q
connect hni to hn+1i for every n ∈ Z. Finally, the inﬁnity edges connect the
45
integer vertices hni to h∞i. Note that, for all but the horizontal edges, two
vertices are connected by an edge if and only if the projective curve systems
given by the vertices can be obtained from each other by surgery on an arc.
If v and w are vertices of D that are connected by an edge, we will denote
the edge by [v,w]. The subgraph S ⊂ D is deﬁned as the portion of D with
u-coordinate in the interval [0,1]. Figure 3.4 shows part of the the graph D.

B −U(T ) to certain paths in D.
i i
An edgepath system γ = (γ ,...,γ ) is an 4-tuple of edgepaths in D
0 3
which start and end at rational points of D. An admissible path system is a
path system with the following four properties:
(E1) The starting point of γ lies on the horizontal edge connecting h1i◦ to
i qi
h1i and if the starting point is not the vertex h1i, then the path γ is
qi qi i
constant.
(E2) γ is minimal. That is, it never stops and retraces itself and it never
i
travels along two sides of a triangle in D in succession.
(E3) The ending points of the γ ’s all have the same u-coordinates and their
i
v-coordinates sum to zero.
(E4) Each γ proceeds monotonically from right to left, in the sense that
i
traversing vertical edges is permitted.
Admissible edgepath systems are divided into the following three types:
• A type I system is an edgepath system γ where each γ stays in S and
i
has no vertical edges.
47
• A type II system is the same as a type I system except that at least one
γ has a vertical edge.
i
• A type III system is a system where the γ ’s end to the left of S.
i
Hatcher and Oertel show how to associate candidate surfaces to each
of these types of edgepaths. It is also shown in [13] that every essential surface
in M with non-empty boundary of ﬁnite slope is isotopic to such a surface.
For the purpose of this paper, it suﬃces to describe the construction of the
candidate surfaces for type II and III systems with no constant paths and with
the endpoints of the γ ’s on vertices of D. Let γ be such a system. We will
i
write γ as [v ,...,v ] where the v ’s are the vertices of γ and the vertex v
i n 0 j i j
is followed by the vertex v as we move along the path. A complete list of
j+1
candidate surfaces for γ is described in the following paragraphs.
For any edge [v ,v ] of γ and a < b, we can build a 1-sheeted surface
j+1 j i
in S × [a,b] as follows. Let α and β be the curve systems with two arc
i
components in S that represent v and v respectively. The surface is
i j j+1
α× a, (a+b)/2 ∪ β × (a+b)/2, b ∪ D,
h ´ ³ i
where D is a regular neighborhood (saddle) of a surgery arc in S × (a+b)/2
i
given by the existence of the the edge [v ,v ]. Up to level preserv©ing isotopªy
j+1 j
there are two choices for each saddle. One of the two possible surfaces for
h1i,h1i is shown in Figure 3.5. To each edgepath γ , we can now associate

£ ¤
We have described the construction of a 1-sheeted candidate surface.
If m is a positive integer, we can also construct an m-sheeted surface for γ
in a similar way. Again, for every edge [v ,v ] in γ , we construct a surface
j j+1 i
in S ×[a,b]. This time we further subdivide the edge into m edges separated
i
by the points k · v + m−k · v where k = 1,...,m − 1. Starting with the
m j m j+1
product surface α× a,(a+b)/2m , we add a saddle at the level (a+b)/2m
to pass to the curve£system 1 · v¢ + m−1 · v . An m-sheeted surface for
m j m j+1
[v ,v ] is completed by adding saddles to pass between the product surfaces
j j+1
that correspond to each point k ·v + m−k ·v . Just as before, we can build
m j m j+1
a surface for γ by stacking the surfaces for each edge γ and ﬁnally gluing
i
everything together to give a surface in M. The meridian of the knot will
49
intersect an m-sheeted surface m times. It is worth noticing that, because
every time we pass a point k ·v + m−k ·v we have a choice between two
m j m j+1
possible saddles, there can be many possible m-sheeted candidate surfaces
associated to a given path system.
The question whether a candidate surface is essential or not can be
studied via the path systems which carry them. This motivates the following
terminology. An admissible path system γ is incompressible if every candidate
surface associated to γ is incompressible, and it is compressible if every asso-
ciated candidate surface is compressible. If there are both compressible and
incompressible candidate surfaces associated to γ, it is said to be indetermi-
nant.
For a path γ in γ, let e be the number of leftward directed edges of
i +
γ which increase slope, and e be the number of slope decreasing edges. The
i −
numbers e and e are independent of the behavior of γ to the left of u = 0.
+ − i
The twist number of γ is
i
t(γ ) = 2(e −e ),
i − +
and the twist number of γ is
t(γ) = t(γ ).
i
X
Hatcher and Oertel show that if S is the Seifert surface for a knot and s a
path system which carries S, then the boundary slope for any surface carried
by γ is t(γ)−t(s).
50
In order to decide whether an admissible path system is compressible,
incompressible, or indeterminant, Hatcher and Oertel deﬁne the notions of
r-values and completely reversible paths. The r-value of a leftward directed
non-horizontal edge is the denominator of the v-coordinate of the point where
the extension of the edge meets the right hand edge of D. The r-value is taken
to be positive if the edge travels upwards and negative if it travels downwards.
If γ is a path in D then its ﬁnal r-value is the r-value for the last edge in the
i
path. If γ is an admissible path system, then its cycle of ﬁnal r-values is the
4-tuple of ﬁnal r-values for the four paths {γ }. The cycle of ﬁnal r-values for
i
γ is deﬁned up to cyclic permutation. A path γ is completely reversible if each
i
pair of successive edges in γ lies in triangles that share a common edge.

Similarly, a Seifert surface Στ for Kτ is carried by sτ. Furthermore, the twist

numbers t(Σ) and t(Στ) are both −(14+4n).
Proof. While building a 1-sheeted candidate surface for s, according to the
construction from Section 3.2.1, we may choose saddles so that the resulting
surface is is the same as the Seifert surface obtained by applying Seifert’s
algorithm to the projection of K shown in Figure 3.2. We calculate the twist

Proof. It suﬃces to show that every candidate surface with twist number 2 is
compressible; this will be proved using three claims which will be established
below.
52
Claim 1. If δ is a type III path system with t(δ) = 2 then
δ = [h∞i, h0i, h1/5i]
0
δ = [h∞i, h1i, h1/2i, h1/3i]
1
δ = [h∞i, h0i, h1/(2n+1)i]
2
δ = [h∞i, h0i, h1/2i]
3
Assume δ is as claimed. Proposition 2.5 of [13] implies that since the
sum of integer vertices of δ is 1, if two of the paths δ are completely reversible
i
then δ is a compressible path system. It can be veriﬁed that δ is completely
0
reversible by noticing that the triangle [h1/5i,h0i,h1i] shares an edge with the
triangle [h0i,h∞i,h1i]. The same argument applies to δ and δ , hence δ is a
2 3
compressible path system.
Claim 2. If δ is a type II path system with t(δ) = 2 then (up to adding
or removing vertical edges on the individual paths)
δ = [h0i, h1/5i]
0
δ = [h0i, h1i, h1/2i, h1/3i]
1
δ = [h0i, h1/(2n+1)i]
2
δ = [h0i, h1i, h1/2i]
3
If δ is as in Claim 2, the cycle of ﬁnal r-values for δ is (−4, 1, −2n, 1).
Proposition 2.9 of [13] shows that there is no incompressible surface associated
to δ.
53
Claim 3. There are no type I path systems with twist number 2.
Assuming the claims, the proof of the lemma is completed.
We now work on establishing the claims.
A basic path is a path starting at a vertex hpi that proceeds monoton-
q
ically to the left (without vertical edges) ending at the left edge of S. A basic
path system is a path system made up of basic paths. Note that a basic path
δ from h1i is either
i r
[h1i, h1/2i, h1/3i, ..., h1/ri]
or
[h0i, h1/ri].
Hence, any such path ends at either 0 or 1. If it ends at 0 then
t(δ ) = 2(1−0) = 2.
i
If it ends at 1 then
t(δ ) = 2 0−(r−1) = 2−2r.
i
¡ ¢
If δ is a basic path system for Kτ that satisﬁes (E1) and (E2), then δ starts
n 0
at h1i, δ starts at h1i, δ starts at h 1 i, and δ starts at h1i. So we have

54
Proof of Claim 1. Let δ be a type III path system with t(δ) = 2. Notice that
(E2) implies that δ has no vertical edges. Let δ0 be the basic path system
δ ∩ S. Since extending paths to h∞i doesn’t aﬀect twist number, we have
2 = t(δ) = t(δ0). There are two choices for each path and four paths, so we
have a total of 24 possible path systems δ0. The corresponding twist numbers
are in the set
{−12, −8, −6, −2, 2, 4, 8, 6−4n, 2−4n, −4n,
−4−4n, −8−4n, −10−4n, −14−4n.}
Since n is an integer, 2 ∈/ {−4n, −4 − 4n, −8 − 4n} and n ≥ 2, so 2 ∈/
{6 − 4n, 2 − 4n, −10 − 4n, 14 − 4n}. We must have t(δ0) = 2 for every n.
There is only one such path system; it extends to the system δ given in the
claim.
Proof of Claim 2. Assume that δ is a type II path system with t(δ) = 2. Then
t(δ) is determined by the basic path system δ0 obtained by deleting all vertical
edges of δ. There are inﬁnitely many extensions of δ0 which satisfy (E3) formed
by adding vertical edges to the end of the individual paths. However, even
if the extensions do not satisfy the minimality condition (E2), any two such
extensions will always have the same twist number. Thus, we may chose to
˜
work with the extension δ where all paths end at h0i. Then
2 if δ0 ends at 0
t(δ˜) = i .
i t(δ0)+2 if δ0 ends at 1
½ i i
55
Again there are 24 possibilities. The corresponding twist numbers are in the
set
{−6, −4, −2, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 8−4n, 6−4n, 4−4n,
2−4n, −4n, −2−4n, −4−4n, −6−4n.}
As before, we know that 2 ∈/ {−4−4n, −4n, 4−4n, 8−4n} since n
is an integer. Also, n ≥ 2 implies 2 ∈/ {−6 − 4n, −2 − 4n, 2 − 4n, 6 − 4n}.
Again, the only remaining possibility satisﬁes the claim.
Proof of Claim 3. Assumethatδ isatypeIpathsystem. Let(t ,...,t )bethe
0 3
4-tuple of endpoints of the paths δ . Since δ is an admissible path system, we
i
knowthatthesumoftheverticalcoordinatesofthet ’siszero, buteverypoint
i
of every δ has vertical coordinate greater than or equal to zero. Therefore,
i
t = 0 for every i. We now know that
i
δ = [h0i, h1/3i]
0
δ = [h0i, h1/5i]
1
δ = [h0i, h1/(2n+1)i]
2
δ = [h0i, h1/2i].
3
However, for this path system, we have
t(δ) = 2+2+2+2 = 8.
We have now established claim 3.
56
In order to show that K has boundary slope 4(n + 4), consider the
n
path system γ = (γ ) in S given by
i
γ = [h1i, h1/2i, h1/3i]
0
γ = [h0i, h1/5i]
1
γ = [h0i, h1/(2n+1)i]
2
γ = [h1i, h1/2i]

Note that γ is not an admissible path system, but by adding vertical edges to
the ends of the paths it extends to an admissible system.
Lemma 3.2.3. For the knot K , the path system γ extends to an admissible
n
system that only carries incompressible surfaces with boundary slope 4(n+4).
Also, every path system that carries this slope is a vertical extension of γ.
Proof. The cycle of ﬁnal r-values for the path system γ is (1, −4, −2n, 1).
Furthermore, the ﬁnal slopes of the γ have positive sum, γ satisﬁes (E2),
i
and each γ ends on the left edge of S. Therefore, by Proposition 2.9 of [13],
i
the γ ’s can be extended by vertical edges to form a system that carries an
i
incompressible surface. As in the proof of Claim 2 above, we can calculate the
twist number of any such path system by calculating the twist number of the
vertical extension γ0 given by adding the vertical edge [h0i,h1i] to both γ and
0
γ .

We calculate the twist number as above; one has:
t(γ0) = 2(1−2) = −2,
0
t(γ0) = 2(1−0) = 2,
1
t(γ0) = 2(1−0) = 2,
2
t(γ0) = 2(1−1) = 0,
3
giving
t(γ0) = t(γ ) = −2+2+2 = 2.
i
X
Therefore, the boundary slope of any surface carried by a vertical extension of
γ is
t(γ0)−t(s) = 2+14+4n = 4(n+4).
The uniqueness of γ follows exactly as in Lemma 3.2.2.
Combining Lemma 3.2.2 and Lemma 3.2.3 yields the following result:
Proposition 3.2.4. For every n > 1, 4(n+4) is a boundary slope of K but
n
not of Kτ. Furthermore, every path system that carries this slope is a vertical
n
extension of γ.
3.3 The slope 4(n + 4) of K is not strongly detected
n
The previous section has established that 4(n + 4) is not a boundary
slope of Kτ. As stated in the introduction to this chapter, if 4(n+4) is strongly
n
detected by a curve in X(K ), then the restriction of every character to the
n
58
Conway sphere S must be reducible. This observation greatly simpliﬁes the
4
problem of showing that this boundary slope is not strongly detected.

out the following relations which will be used repeatedly in the arguments that

Before moving on to the calculations, we prove one more elementary
lemma.

proposition.
Proposition 3.3.5. There exists a ﬁnite set Λ ⊂ C such that if ρ is an
irreducible representation in R(M ) where ρ| is reducible, then χ (a) ∈ Λ. In

particular, the boundary slope 4(n+4) is not strongly detected by X(M ).

Proof. We will calculate all conjugacy classes of irreducible representations ρ
that are reducible on H and show that the possible values for χ (a) lie in a
ρ
ﬁnite set. We start with Λ = {0,±2} and add ﬁnitely many values to this set
as we proceed through several cases.
We may conjugate ρ to assume that its restriction to H is upper trian-
gular. That is, the matrices ρ(a), ρ(b), ρ(c), and ρ(d) are all upper triangular.
Furthermore, since we are looking for new values to add to Λ we may assume
that Tr ρ(a) ∈/ {0,±2}.

Case 1. ρ| is abelian.
H
Since Tr(a) 6= ±2, we can conjugate ρ to assume that a is diagonal.
Since ρ(H) is abelian we know that b,c,d ∈ {a±1}. By Lemma 3.3.4, we know
that b = a. Now using the relation (R1), we have ae = ea. Hence, e is also
diagonal. Since Γ is generated by {a,b,c,d,e}, we conclude that ρ(Γ ) is
2 2
diagonal. The representation ρ is assumed to be irreducible, so ρ| must be
Γ1
irreducible.
The relation (R2) implies that d = c and so (R3) becomes faf = afa
and (R4) becomes cfcfc = fcfcf.
We have already established that c ∈ {a±1}.
• Subcase A. c = a.
The relation (R4) becomes afafa = fafaf. Using (R3) we have
afafa = fa(faf)
= fa(afa)
af = fa.
Then f is diagonal, which contradicts that ρ| is irreducible.

where β ∈ {α±1} and r 6= 0.
If β = α, then (R3) implies that 1 = α2 +r + 1 and (R4) implies that
α2
r2−3r+1 = 0. There are at most eight simultaneous solutions to these
two equations. We add the corresponding values of Tr(a) to Λ and note
that Λ remains ﬁnite.
Otherwise, we have β = 1/α. This time (R3) forces r = −1. Together
with (R4), this means that α must satisfy the equation α8 +α6 +α4 +
α2 +1 = 0. Again, we need only add a ﬁnite number of values to Λ to
account for these representations.
We may now assume that ρ(H) is not abelian.
Case 2. ρ| is reducible.
Γ2
In this case, we may conjugate ρ to assume that a is diagonal and
b, c, d, and e are all upper triangular.
• Subcase A. [a,b] = I.
Then b ∈ {a±1}. Lemma 3.3.2 shows that we must have b = a. Then
(R1) gives [a,e] = I and e must also be diagonal. Also, (R2) implies
d = c. Since ρ(H) is non-abelian, c cannot be diagonal.

• Subcase B. [a,b] 6= I.
Recall that we have conjugated ρ so that a is diagonal and ρ(Γ ) is upper
2
triangular. Since [a,b] 6= I, we know that the upper right entry of b is
66
non-zero, so we can conjugate by diagonal matrices to assume this entry
is 1. As before, Lemma 3.3.2 implies that a and b are identical along
their diagonals. We have

We have assumed that ρ is irreducible. This implies that the lower left
entry of f is non-zero. We also know that Tr(f) = Tr(a) = α + 1/α.
Putting this together, we know that f is of the form
x 1 (−αx2 +α2x+x−α)
f = αy
y 1 (−αx+α2 +1)
µ α ¶
where y 6= 0.
If ρ is a representation, then we must have faf = bfa by (R3). Looking
at the lower left entries of these matrices we get the equation
y(α3x−αx+1)

α2
Then, because α,y 6= 0, we must have
−1
x = .
α(α2 −1)
Making this substitution and equating the upper left entries of faf and
bfa, we arrive at the conclusion that yα = 0, which is not possible.
Therefore, there are no such representations.
Case 3. ρ| is irreducible.
Γ2
67
In this case, when we conjugate so that a is diagonal and b,c, and d
are upper triangular, we know that the lower left entry of e must be
non-zero.
First, note that [a,b] 6= I. This follows from (R1) and Lemma 3.3.4.
Since a is diagonal and not parabolic, if a and b commute then b = a−1
or b = a. Lemma 3.3.4 shows that the ﬁrst possibility doesn’t occur. On
the other hand, if a = b, then (R1) implies that a and e commute. This
is not possible because the lower left entry of e is non-zero.
We may now assume that

where y 6= 0.
We claim that β 6= α. This follows from (R1). Equating the lower right

where β ∈ {α±1} and r ∈ C. Formally, we assign a matrix Θ ∈ SL (C)

to represent the product (ec)n.
Applying Lemma 3.3.1 to the tangle T , we get the relation w =
2 2n−1
(ec)−nc(ec)n and from T we have that w = aea−1. Putting these
3 2n−1
together, we conclude that the matrix Θ should satisfy the relation
Θ−1cΘ = aea−1. (R5)
The matrix Θ should also commute with ec, so we have
Θec = ecΘ. (R6)
Using (R5) and det(Θ) = 1, we can express Θ in terms of α, β,r, and a
new independent variable z. By comparing the matrices in (R6), we can
express r as a function in α, β, and z. If β = α, then the upper right
entries of the matrices from (R5) gives the equality α6−α4−α2+1 = 0.
Thus we may assume that β = 1/α at the price of adding {α+α−1|α6−

and consider the consequences of (R3). Equating the lower right entries

equation implies that t = 0. Then det(f) = 0, a contradiction. Hence
q 6= 0 and we solve det(f) = 1 for s to get s = pt−1. Substituting this
q
for s and looking at the lower right entries again, we get an expression
for p in terms of α and t. Compare the lower left entries to see that
(α−t)(α2t−t−α) = 0. There are two subcases.
• Subcase A. t = α. (This is the case where ρ| is reducible.)

Checking (R4) gives the polynomial equation

By adding {α+α−1|6α8 −17α6 +13α4+2α2−4 = 0} to the set
Λ, we can solve for z2 to get
α4(6α4 −7α2 +2)
z2 = .
6α8 −17α6 +13α4 +2α2 −4
We would like to use this equality to replacez in our only remaining
relation, Θ = (ec)n. Although our expression for Θ in terms of α
and z does contain odd powers of z, when we look at the resulting
expression for Θ2 in terms of α and z we see that it contains only
even powers of z. We replace our expression for z2 into Tr(ec) and
Tr(Θ2) to write these quantities as rational functions in α only,
(α2 +1)(10α4 −15α2 +6)
Tr(ec) =
α4(2α2 −1)(3α2 −2)

Tr(Θ2) = .
α4(2α2−1)(3α2−2)(6α6−11α4+2α2+4)
In light of this, instead of using Θ = (ec)n, we focus on the relation
Tr(Θ2) = Tr (ec)2n . (3.1)
¡ ¢
Using standard trace formulas, Tr(Θ2) = P Tr(ec) where P(x) ∈
Z[x] is a monic polynomial of degree 2n. W¡e wish¢to rule out the
possibility that there are inﬁnitely many solutions for α that will
satisfy this equation. This will happen precisely when the rational
functions Tr(Θ2) and P Tr(ec) are identically equal. However,
Tr(Θ2) has a pole at the r¡oots of¢the polynomial 6x6−11x4+2x2+4
71
while P Tr(ec) takes a ﬁnite value at each of these roots, since the
poles of¡P Tr(e¢c) are the same as the poles of Tr(ec). Therefore,
these ratio¡nal func¢tions are not identically equal and there are only
ﬁnitely many values for α that satisfy equation (3.1). We add the
corresponding traces to Λ and move to the second subcase.

We take resultants to get a polynomial Q(E,T) ∈ Z[E,T], where
Q = 0 on the image of φ. (This polynomial is quite large, so we do
not include it here.) As before, we can express T as a monic degree
n polynomial r(E) ∈ Z[E]. The one variable polynomial equation
Q E,r(E) = 0 holds on Im(φ). As long as this polynomial is not
id¡entically¢zero, the image of φ is 0-dimensional. We show that this
is true by showing that its degree is bigger than zero.

We have now established that Im(φ) is a ﬁnite set of points. The
proof will be complete if we show that the ﬁbers of φ are ﬁnite.

This, together with equation (3.4), implies that

Therefore, the ﬁbers are ﬁnite over every (E,T) unless T2 = 4 and
E2 = 4. It is easy to see that these points are not in the image of
φ.
This completes the proof that 4(n+4) is not strongly detected.
